#
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE:
#
# This file describes the capabilities of various character-cell terminals,
# as needed by software such as screen-oriented editors.
#
# Other terminfo and termcap files exist, supported by various OS vendors
# or as relics of various older versions of UNIX.  This one is the longest
# and most comprehensive one in existence.  It subsumes not only the entirety
# of the historical 4.4BSD, GNU, System V and SCO termcap files, but also large
# numbers of vendor-maintained termcap and terminfo entries more complete
# and carefully tested than those in historical termcap/terminfo versions.
#
# Pointers to related resources (including the ncurses distribution) may
# be found at <http://www.ccil.org/~esr/ncurses.html>.
#
# INTERNATIONALIZATION:
#
# This file assumes a US-ASCII character set. If you need to fix this, start
# by global-replacing \E(B and \E)B with the appropriate ISO 6429 enablers
# for your character set.  \E(A and \E)A enables the British character set
# with the pound sign at position 2/3.
#
# FILE FORMAT:
#
# The version you are looking at may be in any of three formats: master
# (terminfo with OT capabilities), stock terminfo, or termcap.  You can tell
# which by the format given in the header above.
#
# The master format is accepted and generated by the terminfo tools in the
# ncurses suite; it differs from stock (System V-compatible) terminfo only
# in that it admits a group of capabilities (prefixed `OT') equivalent to
# various obsolete termcap capabilities.  You can, thus, convert from master
# to stock terminfo simply by filtering with `sed "/OT[^,]*,/s///"'; but if
# you have ncurses `tic -I' is nicer.
#
# The termcap version is generated automatically from the master version
# using tic -C.  This filtering leaves in the OT capabilities under their
# original termcap names.  All translated entries fit within the
# 1023-byte string-table limit of archaic termcap libraries except where
# explicitly noted below.
#
# For details on these formats, see terminfo(5) in the ncurses distribution,
# and termcap(5) in the 4.4BSD Unix Programmer's Manual.  Be aware that 4.4BSD
# curses has been declared obsolete by the caretakers of the 4.4BSD sources
# as of June 1995; they are encouraging everyone to migrate to ncurses.
#
# Note: unlike some other distributed terminfo files (Novell Unix & SCO's),
# no entry in this file has embedded comments.  This is so source translation
# to termcap only has to carry over leading comments.  Also, no name field
# contains embedded whitespace (such whitespace confuses rdist).
#
# Further note: older versions of this file were often installed with an editor
# script (reorder) that moved the most common terminal types to the front of
# the file.  This should no longer be necessary, as the file is now ordered
# roughly by type frequency with ANSI/VT100 and other common types up front.
#
# Some information has been merged in from terminfo files distributed by
# USL and SCO (see COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS below).  Much information
# comes from vendors who maintain official terminfos for their hardware
# (notably DEC and Wyse).
#
# A detailed change history is included at the end of this file.
#
# FILE ORGANIZATION:
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.  The intent of the divisions is
# (a) to make it easier to find things, and (b) to order the database so
# that important and frequently-encountered terminal types are near the
# front (so that you'll get reasonable search efficiency even if you don't
# use reorder).  Minor sections usually correspond to manufacturers or
# standard terminal classes.  Parenthesized words following manufacturer
# names are type prefixes or product line names used by that manufacturers.
#
# Finally, because this file is released in both terminfo and termcap formats,
# most references to termcap names in comments are bracketed with colons (the
# termcap separator) so they can be distinguished from terminfo capability
# names.
#
# HOW TO READ THE ENTRIES:
#
# The first name in an entry is the canonical name for the model or
# type, last entry is a verbose description.  Others are mnemonic synonyms for
# the terminal.
#
# Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>
# The part to the left of the dash, if a dash is present, describes the
# particular hardware of the terminal.  The part to the right may be used
# for flags indicating special ROMs, extra memory, particular terminal modes,
# or user preferences.
#
# All names should be in lower case, for consistency in typing.
#
# The following are conventionally used suffixes:
#	-2p	Has two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.
#	-am	Enable auto-margin.
#	-m	Monochrome.  Suppress color support
#	-mc	Magic-cookie.  Some terminals (notably older Wyses) can
#		only support one attribute without magic-cookie lossage.
#		Their base entry is usually paired with another that
#		uses magic cookies to support multiple attributes.
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#	-nam	No auto-margin - suppress <am> capability
#	-nl	No labels - suppress soft labels
#	-ns	No status line - suppress status line
#	-rv	Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white)
#	-s	Enable status line.
#	-vb	Use visible bell (<flash>) rather than <bel>.
#	-w	Wide - in 132 column mode.
# If a name has multiple suffixes and one is a line height, that one should 
# go first.  Thus `aaa-30-s-rv' is recommended over `aaa-s-rv'.  
# 
# Entries with embedded plus signs are designed to be included through use/tc
# capabilities, not used as standalone entries. 
#
# To avoid search clashes, some older all-numeric names for terminals have
# been removed (i.e., "33" for the Model 33 Teletype, "2621" for the HP2621).
# All primary names of terminals now have alphanumeric prefixes.
#
# Comments marked "esr" are mostly results of applying the termcap-compiler
# code packaged with ncurses and contemplating the resulting error messages. 
# In many cases, these indicated obvious fixes to syntax garbled by the
# composers.  In a few cases, I was able to deduce corrected forms for garbled
# capabilities by looking at context.  All the information in the original
# entries is preserved in the comments.
#
# In the comments, terminfo capability names are bracketed with <> (angle
# brackets).  Termcap capability names are bracketed with :: (colons).
#
# INTERPRETATION OF USER CAPABILITIES
#
# The System V Release 4 and XPG4 terminfo format defines ten string
# capabilities for use by applications, <u0>...<u9>.   In this file, we use
# certain of these capabilities to describe functions which are not covered
# by terminfo.  The mapping is as follows:
#
#	u9	terminal enquire string (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 DA)
#	u8	terminal answerback description
#	u7	cursor position request (equiv. to VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48 DSR 6)
#	u6	cursor position report (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 CPR)
#
# The terminal enquire string <u9> should elicit an answerback response
# from the terminal.  Common values for <u9> will be ^E (on older ASCII
# terminals) or \E[c (on newer VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# The cursor position request (<u7>) string should elicit a cursor position
# report.  A typical value (for VT100 terminals) is \E[6n.
#
# The terminal answerback description (u8) must consist of an expected
# answerback string.  The string may contain the following scanf(3)-like
# escapes:
#
#	%c	Accept any character
#	%[...]	Accept any number of characters in the given set
#
# The cursor position report (<u6>) string must contain two scanf(3)-style 
# %d format elements.  The first of these must correspond to the Y coordinate
# and the second to the %d.  If the string contains the sequence %i, it is
# taken as an instruction to decrement each value after reading it (this is
# the inverse sense from the cup string).  The typical CPR value is
# \E[%i%d;%dR (on VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# These capabilities are used by tac(1m), the terminfo action checker soon
# to be distributed with ncurses.
# 
# REQUEST FOR CONTACT INFORMATION AND HISTORICAL MATERIAL:
#
# As the ANSI/ECMA-48 standard and variants take firmer hold, and as
# character-cell terminals are increasingly replaced by X displays, much of
# this file is becoming a historical document (this is part of the reason for
# the new organization, which puts ANSI types, xterm, and vt100 up front in
# confidence that this will catch 95% of new hardware).
#
# For the terminal types still alive, I'd like to have manufacturer's
# contact data (Internet address and/or snail-mail + phone).
#
# I'm also interested in enriching the comments so that the latter portions of
# the file do in fact become a potted history of VDT technology as seen by
# UNIX hackers.  Ideally, I'd like the headers for each manufacturer to
# include its live/dead/out-of-the-business status, and for as many
# terminal types as possible to be tagged with information like years
# of heaviest use, popularity, and interesting features.
#
# I'm especially interested in identifying the obscure entries listed under
# `Manufacturer unknown' and `Utter unknowns', before the tribal wisdom 
# about them gets lost.
#
# If you have been around long enough to contribute, please read the file
# with this in mind and send me your annotations.

# COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS
#
# The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of
# California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.
#
# Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.
# It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they 
# took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file
# and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.
#
# Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may
# serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous
# contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of
# graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.
#
# This file deliberately has no copyright.  It belongs to no one and everyone.
# If you claim you own it, you will merely succeed in looking like a fool. 
# Use it as you like.  Use it at your own risk.  Copy and redistribute freely.

######## STANDARD AND SPECIAL TYPES

#### Specials
#
# Special "terminals".  These are used to label tty lines when you don't
# know what kind of terminal is on it.  The characteristics of an unknown
# terminal are the lowest common denominator - they look about like a ti 700.

#### DEC VT100 and compatibles
#
# DEC terminals from the vt100 forward (and the vt52, way obsolete but still
# the basis of some emulations) are collected here. Older DEC terminals and
# micro consoles can be found in the `obsolete' section.  More details on
# the relationship between the VT100 and ANSI X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 may be
# found near the end of this file.
#
# Except where noted, these entries are DEC's official terminfos.
# Contact Bill Hedberg <hedberg@hannah.enet.dec.com> of Terminal Support
# Engineering for more information.  Updated terminfos and termcaps 
# are kept available at ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/termcaps.

# NOTE:  Any VT100 emulation, whether in hardware or software, almost
# certainly includes what DEC called the `Level 1 editing extension' codes;
# only the very oldest VT100s lacked these and there probably aren't any of
# those left alive.  To capture these, use one of the VT102 entries.
#
# Note that the <xenl> glitch in vt100 is not quite the same as on the Concept,
# since the cursor is left in a different position while in the
# weird state (concept at beginning of next line, vt100 at end
# of this line) so all versions of vi before 3.7 don't handle
# <xenl> right on vt100. The correct way to handle <xenl> is when
# you output the char in column 80, immediately output CR LF
# and then assume you are in column 1 of the next line. If <xenl>
# is on, am should be on too.
# 
# I assume you have smooth scroll off or are at a slow enough baud
# rate that it doesn't matter (1200? or less). Also this assumes
# that you set auto-nl to "on", if you set it off use vt100-nam 
# below.
# 
# The padding requirements listed here are guesses. It is strongly
# recommended that xon/xoff be enabled, as this is assumed here.
# 
# The vt100 uses <rs2> and <rf> rather than <is2>/<tbc>/<hts> because the 
# tab settings are in non-volatile memory and don't need to be 
# reset upon login. Also setting the number of columns glitches 
# the screen annoyingly. You can type "reset" to get them set.

# VT320.  Here are the designer's notes:
# <kel> is end on a PC kbd.  Actually 'select' on a VT.  Mapped to 
# 'Erase to End of Field'... since nothing seems to use 'end' anyways...
# khome is Home on a PC kbd.  Actually 'FIND' on a VT.
# Things that use <knxt> usually use tab anyways... and things that don't use
# tab usually use <knxt> instead...
# kprv is same as tab - Backtab is useless...
# I left out <sgr> because of its RIDICULOUS complexity,
# and the resulting fact that it causes the termcap translation of the entry
# to SMASH the 1k-barrier...

# VT330 and VT340 -- These are ReGIS and SIXEL graphics terminals

#   host writable status line, yet another different DRCS matrix size,
#   and such, but they add the DEC Technical character set, Multiple text
#   pages, selectable length pages, and the like.  The difference between
#   the vt330 and vt340 is that the latter has only 2 planes and a monochrome
#   monitor, the former has 4 planes and a color monitor.  These terminals
#   support VT131 and ANSI block mode, but as with much of these things,
#   termcap/terminfo doesn't deal with these features.

# Note that this entry is are set up in what was the standard way for GNU
# Emacs v18 terminal modes to deal with the cursor keys in that the arrow

# and ASCII emulations (WY160/60, PCTerm, 50/50+, 150/120, TVI 950,
# 925 910+, ADDS A2).  This terminfo data is for the ANSI emulations only.
#
# Terminal Set-Up is entered by pressing [F3], [Caps Lock]/[F3] or
# [Alt]/[Print Screen] depending upon which keyboard and which
# terminal mode is being used.  If Set-Up has been disabled or
# assigned to an unknown key, Set-Up may be entered by pressing

#### Lear-Siegler (adm)
#
# These guys are long since out of the terminals business, but
# in 1995 many current terminals still have an adm type as one of their
# emulations (usually their stupidest, and usually labeled adm3, though
# these `adm3' emulations normally have adm3a+ capabilities).
#
# WARNING: Some early ADM terminals (including the ADM3 and ADM5) are 
# reputed to have had the weird `feature' that sending them a ^G would trigger
# a diagnostic dump to screen if one of the more obscure RS-232 pins
# (variously reported as 22 or as `Ring Indicator') was being held high during
# receipt of the ^G.  If you have a real ADM and think you've run into this,
# check it out with a breakout box and tell us if this rumor is correct!
# A quick fix might be to drop back to a cheesy 4-wire cable.

# Discontinued Qume models:
#
# The qvt101 and qvt102 listed here are long obsolete; so is the qvt101+
# built to replace them, and a qvt119+ which was a 101+ with available wide
# mode (132 columns).  There was a qvt103 which added vt100/vt131 emulations
# and an ANSI-compatible qvt203 that replaced it.  Qume started producing
# ANSI-compatible terminals with the qvt323 and qvt61.
#
# Current Qume models (as of February 1995):
#
# All current Qume terminals have ANSI-compatible operation modes.
# Qume is still producing the qvt62, which features emulations for other
# popular lines such as ADDS, and dual-host capabilities.  The qvt82 is
# designed for use as a SCO ANSI terminal.  The qvt70 is a color terminal
# with many emulations including Wyse370, Wyse 325, etc.  Their newest
# model is the qvt520, which is vt420-compatible.

# There are some tvi terminals that require incredible amounts of padding and
# some that don't.  I'm assuming 912 and 920 are the old slow ones,
# and 912b, 912c, 920b, 920c are the new ones that don't need padding.
#
# All of these terminals (912 to 970 and the tvipt) are discontinued.  Newer
# Televideo terminals are ANSI and PC-ANSI compatible.

#	The Wyse 350 is a Wyse 50 with color.
#	Unfortunately this means that it has magic cookies.
#	The color attributes are designed to overlap the reverse, dim and
#	underline attributes.  This is nice for monochrome applications
#	because you can make underline stuff green (or any other color)
#	but for true color applications it's not so hot because you cannot
#	mix color with reverse, dim or underline.
#	    To further complicate things one of the attributes must be
#	black (either the foreground or the background).  In reverse video
#	the background changes color with black letters.  In normal video
#	the foreground changes colors on a black background.  
#	    This terminfo uses some of the more advanced features of curses
#	to display both color and blink.  In the final analysis I am not
#	sure that the wy350 runs better with this terminfo than it does
#	with the wy50 terminfo (with user adjusted colors).
#
#	The mandatory pause used by flash does not work with
#	older versions of terminfo.  If you see this effect then
#	unset xon and delete the / from the delay.

#	The Wyse 60 is like the Wyse 50 but with more padding.

#		<rs2> -> set number of columns
#		<rs3> -> set number of lines
#		<is1> -> select the proper font
#		<is2> -> do the initialization
#		<is3> -> set up display memory (2 pages)
#
#	The Wyse 60's that have vt100 emulation are slower than the
#	older Wyse 60's.  This change happened mid-1987.
#	The capabilities effected are <dch1> <dl1> <il1> <ind> <ri>
#
#	The meta key is only half right.  This terminal will return the

#	        \E=W,   look at bottom of page 1

#
#	Note:

######## NON-ANSI TERMINAL EMULATIONS
#

#### Avatar
#
# These entries attempt to describe Avatar, a terminal emulation used with
# MS-DOS bulletin-board systems.  It was designed to give ANSI-like
# capabilities, but with cheaper (shorter) control sequences.  Messy design,
# excessively dependent on PC idiosyncracies, but apparently rather popular
# in the BBS world.
#
# No color support.  Avatar doesn't fit either of the Tektronix or HP color
# models that terminfo knows about.  An Avatar color attribute is the
# low 7 bits of the IBM-PC display-memory attribute.  Bletch.
#
# I wrote these entries while looking at the Avatar spec.  I don't have
# the facilities to test them.  Let me know if they work, or don't.
#
# From: Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com> 1 Nov 1995
# (The <blink>/<bold>/<rev>/<smacs>/<smul>/<smso> capabilities exist only to
# tell ncurses that the corresponding highlights exist; it should use <sgr>,
# which is the only method that will actually work for multiple highlights.)

######## OLDER TERMINAL TYPES
#
# This section is devoted to older commercial terminal brands that are now
# discontinued, but known to be still in use or represented by emulations.
#

#### AT&T (att, tty)
#
# This section also includes Teletype-branded VDTs.
#
# The AT&T/Teletype terminals group was sold to SunRiver Data Systems; for
# details, see the header comment on the ADDS section.
#
# These are AT&T's official terminfo entries.  All-caps aliases have been

# Extensive changes to c108 by arpavax:eric Feb 1982
# Some unknown person at SCO then translated it to terminfo.
#
# There seem to be a number of different versions of the C108 PROMS
# (with bug fixes in its Z-80 program).
# 
# The first one that we had would lock out the keyboard of you
# sent lots of short lines (like /usr/dict/words) at 9600 baud.
# Try that on your C108 and see if it sends a ^S when you type it.
# If so, you have an old version of the PROMs.
# 
# You should configure the C108 to send ^S/^Q before running this.
# It is much faster (at 9600 baud) than the c100 because the delays
# are not fixed.
# new status line display entries for c108-8p:
# <is3> - init str #3 - setup term for status display - 
# set programmer mode, select window 2, define window at last 
# line of memory, set bkgnd stat mesg there, select window 0.
# 
# <tsl> - to status line - select window 2, home cursor, erase to 
# end-of-window, 1/2 bright on, goto(line#0, col#?)
# 
# <fsl> - from status line - 1/2 bright off, select window 0
# 
# <dsl> - disable status display - set bkgnd status mesg with 
# illegal window #
# 
# There are probably more function keys that should be added but 
# I don't know what they are.
#
# No delays needed on c108 because of ^S/^Q handshaking

# Concept 100:
# These have only window relative cursor addressing, not screen 
# relative. To get it to work right here, smcup/rmcup (which 
# were invented for the concept) lock you into a one page 
# window for screen style programs.
# 
# To get out of the one page window, we use a clever trick:
# we set the window size to zero ("\Ev    " in rmcup) which the 
# terminal recognizes as an error and resets the window to all 
# of memory.
# 
# This trick works on c100 but does not on c108, sigh.
# 
# Some tty drivers use cr3 for concept, others use nl3, hence 
# the delays on cr and ind below. This padding is only needed at 
# 9600 baud and up.  One or the other is commented out depending on 
# local conventions.
# 
# 2 ms padding on <rmcup> isn't always enough. 6 works fine. Maybe 
# less than 6 but more than 2 will work.
# 
# Note: can't use function keys f7-f10 because they are 
# indistinguishable from arrow keys (!), also, del char and 
# clear eol use xon/xoff so they probably won't work very well.
# 
# Also note that we don't define insrt/del char/delline/eop/send 
# because they don't transmit unless we reset them - I figured 
# it was a bad idea to clobber their definitions.
# 
# The <mc5> sequence changes the escape character to ^^ so that 
# escapes will be passed through to the printer. Only trouble 
# is that ^^ won't be - ^^ was chosen to be unlikely. 
# Unfortunately, if you're sending raster bits through to be 
# plotted, any character you choose will be likely, so we lose.
#
# \EQ"\EY(^W (send anything from printer to host, for xon/xoff) 
# cannot be # in is2 because it will hang a c100 with no printer 
# if sent twice.

# The f110 and f200 have problems with vi(1).  They use the ^V
# code for the down cursor key. When kcud1 is defined in terminfo
# as ^V, the Control Character Quoting capability (^V in insert mode)
# is lost! It cannot be remapped in vi because it is necessary to enter
# a ^V to to quote the ^V that is being remapped!!!
# 
# f110 users will have to decide whether
# to lose the down cursor key or the quoting capability. We will opt
# initially for leaving the quoting capability out, since use of VI
# is not generally applicable to most interactive applications
# 
# The same applies to f200 users, except that another option exists.
# This option has been chosen locally. It will not be distributed unless
# a user runs into this problem and requests assistance.  Very few users,
# if any, should run into this problem. The local solution is in
# vifix.local.ti.  The f200 has the ability to reprogram the down cursor
# key. The key is reprogrammed to ^J (linefeed). This value is remembered
# in non-volatile RAM, so powering the terminal off and on will not cause
# the change to be lost. The terminfo definition for the f200 is changed
# to identify <kcud1> as ^J instead of ^V.

#### Harris (Beehive)
#
# Bletch.  These guys shared the Terminal Brain Damage laurels with Hazeltine.
# Their terminal group is ancient history now (1995) though the parent
# company is still in business.
#

# Beehive documentation is undated and marked Preliminary and has no figures
# so we must have early Superbee2 (Model 600, according to phone conversation
# with mfr.). It has proved reliable except for some missing padding
# (notably after \EK and <nl> at bottom of screen).
# 
# The key idea is that AEP mode is poison for <cup> & that US's in 
# the local memory should be avoided like the plague. That means 
# that the 2048 character local buffer is used as 25 lines of 80 
# characters, period. No scrolling local memory, folks. It also 
# appears that we cannot use naked INS LINE feature since it uses
# US. The sbi fakes <il1> with an 80-space insert that may be too 
# slow at low speeds; also spaces get converted to \040 which is 
# too long for some programs (not vi).  DEL LINE is ok but slow.
# 
# The <nl> string is designed for last line of screen ONLY; cup to 
# 25th line corrects the motion inherent in scrolling to Page 1.
# 
# There is one understood bug. It is that the screen appears to
# pop to a new (blank) page after a <nel>, or leave a half-line 
# ellipsis to a quad that is the extra 48 memory locations. The 
# data received is dumped into memory but not displayed.  Not to 
# worry if <cup> is being used; the lines not displayed will be, 
# whenever the cursor is moved up there. Since <cup> is addressed 
# relative to MEMORY of window, nothing is lost; but beware of 
# relative cursor motion (<cuu1>,<cud1>,<cuf1>,<cub1>). Recommended,
# therefore, is setenv MORE -c .
# 
# WARNING: Not all features tested.
# 
# Timings are assembled from 3 sources. Some timings may reflect 
# SB2/Model 300 that were used if more conservative.
# Tested on a Model 600 at 1200 and 9600 bd.
# 
# The BACKSPACEkb option is cute. The NEWLINE key, so cleverly 
# placed on the keyboard and useless because of AEP, is made 
# into a backspace key. In use ESC must be pressed twice (to send)
# and sending ^C must be prefixed by ESC to avoid that weird 
# transmit mode associated with ENTER key.
# 
# IF TERMINAL EVER GOES CATATONIC with the cursor buzzing across 
# the screen, then it has dropped into ENTER mode; hit 
# RESET--ONLINE--!tset.
# 
# As delivered this machine has a FATAL feature that will throw 
# it into that strange transmit state (SPOW) if the space bar is 
# hit after a CR is received, but before receiving a LF (or a 
# few others).
# 
# The circuits MUST be modified to eliminate the SPOW latch. 
# This is done by strapping on chip A46 of the I/O board; cut 
# the p.c. connection to Pin 5 and strap Pin 5 to Pin 8 of that 
# chip. This mod has been checked out on a Mod 600 of Superbee II.
# With this modification absurdly high timings on cr are 
# unnecessary.
# 
# NOTE WELL that the rear panel switch should be set to CR/LF, 
# not AEP!

# Kimtron ABM 85H added by Dual Systems.
# Some notes about the 85h entries:
# 1) there are several firmware revs of 85H in the world. Use abm85h-old for
#    firmware revs prior to SP51
# 2) Make sure to use 85h entry if the terminal is in 85H mode and the
#    85e entry if it is in 920 emulation mode. They are incompatible in
#    some places and NOT software settable i.e., <is2> can't fix it)
# 3) In 85h mode, the arrow keys and special functions transmit when
#    the terminal is in dup-edit, and work only locally in local-edit.
#    Vi won't swallow `del char' for instance, but <smcup> turns on
#    dup-edit anyway so that the arrow keys will work right. If the
#    arrow keys don't work the way you like, change <smcup>, <rmcup>, and
#    <is2>.  Note that 920E mode does not have software commands to toggle
#    between dup and local edit, so you get whatever was set last on the
#    terminal.
# 4) <flash> attribute is nice, but seems too slow to work correctly
#    (\Eb<pad>\Ed)
# 5) Make sure `hidden' attributes are selected. If `embedded' attributes
#    are selected, the <xmc@> entry should be removed.
# 6) auto new-line should be on (selectable from setup mode only)

# The following status modes are assumed for normal operation (replace the
# initial "!" by whatever the current command character is):
#	!COM 29			# NOTE: changes command character to GS (^])
#	^]DUP
#	^]ECH R
#	^]EOL
#	^]RSS T
#	^]SNO N
#	^]STO 9 17 25 33 41 49 57 65 73
# Other modes may be set according to communication requirements.
# If the command character is inadvertently changed, termcap can't restore it.
# Insert-character cannot be made to work on both top and bottom rows.
# Clear-to-end-of-display emulation via !DLI 988 is too grotty to use, alas.
# There also seems to be a problem with vertical motion, perhaps involving
# delete/insert-line, following a typed carriage return.  This terminal sucks.
# Delays not specified; use "stty ixon -ixany" to enable DC3/DC1 flow control!

# The pcplot IBM-PC terminal emulation program is really messed up. It is
# supposed to emulate a vt-100, but emulates the wraparound bug incorrectly,
# doesn't support scrolling regions, ignores add line commands, and ignores
# delete line commands. Consequently, the resulting behavior looks like a
# crude adm3a-type terminal.

#### Console types for obsolete UNIX clones
#
# Coherent, Minix, Venix, and several lesser-known kin were OSs for 8088
# machines that tried to emulate the UNIX look'n'feel.  Coherent and Venix
# were commercial, Minix an educational tool sold in conjuction with a book.
# Memory-segmentation limits and a strong tendency to look like V7 long after
# it was obsolete made all three pretty lame.  Venix croaked early.  Coherent
# and Minix were ported to 32-bit Intel boxes, only to be run over by a
# steamroller named `Linux' (which, to be fair, traces some lineage to Minix). 
# Coherent's vendor, the Mark Williams Company, went belly-up in 1994.

#### Bell Labs blit terminals
#
# These were AT&T's official entries.  The 5620 FAQ maintained by 
# David Breneman <daveb@dgtl.com> has this to say:
#
#  Actually, in the beginning was the Jerq, and the Jerq was white with a
#  green face, and Locanthi and Pike looked upon the Jerq and said the Jerq
#  was good.  But lo, upon the horizon loomed a mighty management-type person
#  (known now only by the initials VP) who said, the mighty Jerq must stay
#  alone, and could not go forth into the world. So Locanthi and Pike put the
#  Jerq to sleep, cloned its parts, and the Blit was brought forth unto the
#  world. And the Jerq lived the rest of its days in research, but never
#  strayed from those paths.
#
#  In all seriousness, the Blit was originally known as the Jerq, but when
#  it started to be shown outside of the halls of the Bell Labs Research
#  organization, the management powers that be decided that the name could
#  not remain. So it was renamed to be Blit. This was in late 1981.
#
# (The AT&T 5620 was the commercialized Blit.  Its successors were the 630,
# 730, and 730+.)

#
# The BitGraph was a product of the now-defunct BBN Computer Corporation.
# The parent company, best known as the architects of the Internet, is
# still around.
#

# Entries for the BitGraph terminals.  The problem 
# with scrolling in vi can only be fixed by getting BBN to put 
# smarter scroll logic in the terminal or changing vi or padding 
# scrolls with about 500 ms delay.
#	
# I always thought the problem was related to the terminal 
# counting newlines in its input buffer before scrolling and

# The major problem with the Z29 is that it requires more padding than the Z19.
#
# The problem with declaring an H19 to be synonymous with a Z29 is that
# it needs more padding. It especially loses if a program attempts
# to put the Z29 into insert mode and insert text at 9600 baud. It
# even loses worse if the program attempts to insert tabs at 9600
# baud. Adding padding to text that is inserted loses because in 
# order to make the Z29 not die, one must add so much padding that
# whenever the program tries to use insert mode, the effective 
# rate is about 110 baud.
# 
# What program would want to put the terminal into insert mode 
# and shove stuff at it at 9600 baud you ask?  
# 
# Emacs. Emacs seems to want to do the mathematically optimal 
# thing in doing a redisplay rather than the practical thing.
# When it is about to output a line on top of a line that is 
# already on the screen, instead of just killing to the end of 
# the line and outputting the new line, it compares the old line 
# and the new line and if there are any similarities, it 
# constructs the new line by deleting the text on the old line 
# on the terminal that is already there and then inserting new
# text into the line to transform it into the new line that is 
# to be displayed. The Z29 does not react kindly to this.
# 
# But don't cry for too long.... There is a solution. You can make
# a termcap entry for the Z29 that says the Z29 has no insert mode.
# Then Emacs cannot use it. "Oh, no, but now inserting into a 
# line will be really slow", you say. Well there is a sort of a
# solution to that too. There is an insert character option on 
# the Z29 that will insert one character. Unfortunately, it 
# involves putting the terminal into ansi mode, inserting the 
# character, and changing it back to H19 mode. All this takes 12 
# characters. Pretty expensive to insert one character, but it 
# works. Either Emacs doesn't try to use its inserting hack when 
# it's only given an insert character ability or the Z29 doesn't 
# require padding with this (the former is probably more likely, 
# but I haven't checked it out).

#### Synertek
#
# Bob Manson <manson@pattyr.acs.ohio-state.edu> writes (28 Apr 1995):
#
# Synertek used to make ICs, various 6502-based single-board process
# control and hobbyist computers, and assorted peripherals including a
# series of small inexpensive terminals (I think they were one of the
# first to have a "terminal-on-a-keyboard", where the terminal itself
# was only slightly larger than the keyboard).
#
# They apparently had a KTM-1 model, which I've never seen. The KTM-2/40
# was a 40x24 terminal that could connect to a standard TV through a
# video modulator.  The KTM-2/80 was the 80-column version (the 2/40
# could be upgraded to the 2/80 by adding 2 2114 SRAMs and a new ROM).
# I have a KTM-2/80 still in working order.  The KTM-2s had fully
# socketed parts, used 2 6507s, a 6532 as keyboard scanner, a program
# ROM and 2 ROMs as character generators. They were incredibly simple,
# and I've never had any problems with mine (witness the fact that mine
# was made in 1981 and is still working great... I've blown the video
# output transistor a couple of times, but it's a 2N2222 :-)
#
# The KTM-3 (which is what is listed in the terminfo file) was their
# attempt at putting a KTM-2 in a box (and some models came with a
# CRT). It wasn't much different from the KTM-2 hardware-wise, but the
# control and escape sequences are very different. The KTM-3 was always
# real broken, at least according to the folks I've talked to about it.
# 
# The padding in the entry is probably off--these terminals were very
# slow (it takes like 100ms for the KTM-2 to clear the screen...) And
# anyone with any sanity replaced the ROMs with something that provided
# a reasonable subset of VT100 functionality, since the usual ROMs were
# obviously very primitive... oh, you could get an upgraded ROM from
# Synertek for some incredible amount of money, but what hacker with an
# EPROM burner would do that? :)
# 
# Sorry I don't have any contact info; I believe they were located in
# Sunnyvale, and I'm fairly sure they are still manufacturing ICs
# (they've gone to ASICs and FPGAs), but I doubt they're in the computer
# business these days.

# Tested, seems to work fine with vi.

# The Teleray terminals were all discontinued in 1992-93.  RI still services
# and repairs these beasts, but no longer manufactures them.  The Teleray
# people believe that all the types listed below are very rare now (1995).
# There was a newer line of Telerays (Model 7, Model 20, Model 30, and
# Model 100) that were ANSI-compatible.
#
# Note two things called "teleray".  Reorder should move the common one
# to the front if you have either.  A dumb teleray with the cursor stuck
# on the bottom and no obvious model number is probably a 3700.

#### Obsolete non-ANSI software emulations

# CTRM terminal emulator
# 1. underlining is not allowed with colors: first, is is simulated by 
# black on white, second, it disables background color manipulations.
# 2. BLINKING, REVERSE and BOLD are allowed with colors,
# so we have to save their status in the static registers A, B and H
# respectively, to be able to restore them when color changes
# (because any color change turns off ALL attributes)
# 3. <bold> and <rev> sequences alternate modes,
# rather then simply  entering them.  Thus we have to check the
# static register B and H to determine the status, before sending the 
# escape sequence.
# 4. <sgr0> now must set the status of all 3 register (A,B,H) to zero
# and then reset colors
# 5. implementation of the protect mode would badly penalize the performance.
# we would have to use \E&bn sequence to turn off colors (as well as all
# other attributes), and keep the status of protect mode in yet another
# static variable.  If someone really needs this mode, they would have to
# create another terminfo entry.
# 6. original color-pair is white on black.
# store the information about colors into static registers
# 7. set foreground color.  it performs the following steps.
#   1) turn off all attributes
#   2) turn on the background and video attributes that have been turned
#      on before (this information is stored in static registers X,Y,Z,A,B,H,D).
#   3) turn on foreground attributes
#   4) store information about foreground into U,V,W static registers
# 8. turn on background: similar to turn on foreground above
# (untranslatable capabilities removed to fit entry within 1023 bytes)

# and cursor addressing sends a tab for row/column 9.  What a losing terminal!

######## ICH/ICH1 VERSUS RMIR/SMIR
#
# Some non-curses applications get confused if both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir
# are present; the symptom is doubled characters in an update using insert.
# These applications are technically correct; in both 4.3BSD termcap and
# terminfo, you're not actually supposed to specify both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir
# unless the terminal needs both.  This requirement is now rare; most ich
# sequences do not require previous smir, and most smir insert modes do not
# require ich1 before each character.
#
# For ncurses-based applications this is not a problem, as ncurses uses
# one or the other as appropriate but never mixes the two.  Therefore we
# have not corrected entries like `linux' and `xterm' that specify both.
# If you see doubled characters from these, use the linux-nic and xterm-nic
# entries that suppress ich/ich1.  And upgrade to ncurses!
#

######## VT100/ANSI/ISO 6429/ECMA-48/PC-TERM TERMINAL STANDARDS
#
# ANSI X3.64 has been withdrawn and replaced by ECMA-48.  The ISO 6429 and
# ECMA-48 standards are said to be almost identical, but are not the same
# as X3.64 (though for practical purposes they are close supersets of it).
#
# You can obtain ECMA-48 for free by sending email to helpdesk@ecma.ch
# requesting the standard(s) you want (i.e. ECMA-48, "Control Functions for
# Coded Character Sets"), include your snail-mail address, and you should
# receive the document in due course.  Don't expect an email acknowledgement.
#
# Related standards include "X3.4-1977: American National Standard Code for
# Information Interchange" (the ASCII standard) and "X3.41.1974: 
# Code-Extension Techniques for Use with the 7-Bit Coded Character Set of
# American National Standard for Information Interchange."  I believe (but
# am not certain) that these are effectively identical to ECMA-6 and ECMA-35
# respectively. 
#

#### VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48
#
# ANSI Standard (X3.64) Control Sequences for Video Terminals and Peripherals
# and ECMA-48 Control Functions for Coded Character Sets.
# 
# Most of the content of this comment is adapted from a table prepared by
# Richard Shuford, based on a 1984 Byte article.  Terminfo correspondences,
# discussion of some terminfo-related issues, and updates to capture ECMA-48
# have been added.  Control functions described in ECMA-48 only are tagged
# with * after their names.
#
# The table is a complete list of the defined ANSI X3.64/ECMA-48 control
# sequences.  In the main table, \E stands for an escape (\033) character,
# SPC for space.  Pn stands for a single numeric parameter to be inserted
# in decimal ASCII.  Ps stands for a list of such parameters separated by
# semicolons.  Parameter meanings for most parametrized sequences are
# decribed in the notes.
#
# (NOTE: THE ECMA-48 COVERAGE IN THE TABLE IS NOT YET ACTUALLY COMPLETE,
# IT IS ONLY COMPLETE UP TO THE BROKEN LINE OF DASHES.  Have patience,
# reading the legalese and adding entries is a long-drawn-out and tedious
# process...)

# Notes:
#
# Some control characters are listed in the ECMA-48 standard without 
# being assigned functions relevant to terminal control there (they 
# referred to other standards such as ISO 1745 or ECMA-35).  They are listed
# here anyway for completeness.
#
# (A) ECMA-48 calls this "CancelCharacter" but retains the CCH acronyms.
#
# (B) There seems to be some confusion abroad between CHA and HPA.  Most
# `ANSI' terminals accept the CHA sequence, not the HPA. but terminfo calls
# the capability (hpa).  ECMA-48 calls this "Cursor Character Absolute" but
# preserved the CHA acronym.
#
# (C) CHT corresponds to terminfo (tab).  Usually it has the value ^I.
# Occasionally (as on, for example, certain HP terminals) this has the HTJ
# value.  ECMA-48 calls this "Cursor Forward Tabulation" but preserved the
# CHT acronym.
#
# (D) terminfo (nel) is usually \r\n rather than ANSI \EE.
#
# (E) ECNA-48 calls this "Active Position Report" but preserves the CPR 
# acronym.
# 
# (F) CTC parameter values: 0 = set char tab, 1 = set line tab, 2 = clear
# char tab, 3 = clear line tab, 4 = clear all char tabs on current line, 
# 5 = clear all char tabs, 6 = clear all line tabs.
#
# (G) CUP and HVP are identical in effect.  Some ANSI.SYS versions accept
# HVP, but always allow CUP as an alternate.  ECMA-48 calls HVP "Character
# Position Absolute" but retains the HVP acronym.
#
# (H) ECMA calls this "Cursor Line Tabulation" but preserves the CVT acronym.
#
# (I) DSR parameter values: 0 = ready, 1 = busy, 2 = busy, will send DSR
# later, 3 = malfunction, 4 = malfunction, will send DSR later, 5 = request
# DSR, 6 = request CPR response.
#
# (J) ECMA calls ED "Erase In Page". EA/ED/EL parameters: 0 = clear to end,
# 1 = clear from beginning, 2 = clear.
# 
# (K) ECMA calls this "End of Guarded Area" but preserves the EPA acronym.
#
# (L) The GSM parameters are vertical and horizontal parameters to scale by.
#
# (M) Some ANSI.SYS versions accept HPR, but more commonly `ANSI' terminals
# use CUF for this function and ignore HPR.  ECMA-48 calls this "Character
# Position Relative" but retains the HPR acronym.
#
# (N) ECMA-48 calls this "Character Tabulation" but retains the HT acronym.
#
# (O) SGR parameter values: 0 = default mode (attributes off), 1 = bold,
# 2 = dim, 3 = italicized, 4 = underlined, 5 = slow blink, 6 = fast blink,
# 7 = reverse video, 8 = invisible, 9 = crossed-out (marked for deletion),
# 10 = primary font, 10 + n (n in 1..9) = nth alternative font, 20 = Fraktur,
# 21 = double underline, 22 = turn off 2, 23 = turn off 3, 24 = turn off 4,
# 25 = turn off 5, 26 = proportional spacing, 27 = turn off 7, 28 = turn off
# 8, 29 = turn off 9, 30 = black fg, 31 = red fg, 32 = green fg, 33 = yellow
# fg, 34 = blue fg, 35 = magenta fg, 36 = cyan fg, 37 = white fg, 38 = set
# fg color as in CCIT T.416, 39 = set default fg color, 40 = black bg
# 41 = red bg, 42 = green bg, 43 = yellow bg, 44 = blue bg, 45 = magenta bg,
# 46 = cyan bg, 47 = white bg, 48 = set bg color as in CCIT T.416, 39 = set
# default bg color, 50 = turn off 26, 51 = framed, 52 = encircled, 53 =
# overlined, 54 = turn off 51 & 52, 55 = not overlined, 56-59 = reserved,
# 61-65 = variable highlights for ideograms.
#
# (P) SI is also called LSO, Locking Shift Zero.
#
# (Q) SI is also called LS1, Locking Shift One.
#
# (R) Some ANSI.SYS versions accept VPR, but more commonly `ANSI' terminals
# use CUD for this function and ignore VPR.
#
# (S) MC parameters: 0 = start xfer to primary aux device, 1 = start xfer from
# primary aux device, 2 = start xfer to secondary aux device, 3 = start xfer
# from secondary aux device, 4 = stop relay to primary aux device, 5 = 
# start relay to primary aux device, 6 = stop relay to secondary aux device,
# 7 = start relay to secondary aux device.

# 
# Ps     is a variable number of selective parameters in a control sequence
#        with each selective parameter separated from the other by the code
#        3/11 (which usually represents a semicolon); Ps ranges from
#        3/0 to 3/9 and includes 3/11
#
# *      Not relevant to terminal control, listed for completeness only.
# 
# Format Effectors versus Editor Functions
# 
# A format effector specifies how following output is to be displayed.
# An editor function allows you to modify the display.  Informally
# format effectors may be destructive; format effectors should not be.
# 
# For instance, a format effector that moves the "active position" (the 
# cursor or equivalent) one space to the left would be useful when you want to
# create an overstrike, a compound character made of two standard characters
# overlaid. Control-H, the Backspace character, is actually supposed to be a
# format effector, so you can do this. But many systems use it in a
# nonstandard fashion, as an editor function, deleting the character to the
# left of the cursor and moving the cursor left. When Control-H is assumed to
# be an editor function, you cannot predict whether its use will create an
# overstrike unless you also know whether the output device is in an "insert
# mode" or an "overwrite mode". When Control-H is used as a format effector,
# its effect can always be predicted. The familiar characters carriage
# return, linefeed, formfeed, etc., are defined as format effectors.
#
# NOTES ON THE DEC VT100 IMPLEMENTATION
# 
# Control sequences implemented in the VT100 are as follows:
# 
#      CPR, CUB, CUD, CUF, CUP, CUU, DA, DSR, ED, EL, HTS, HVP, IND,
#      LNM, NEL, RI, RIS, RM, SGR, SM, TBC
# 
# plus several private DEC commands.
# 
# Erasing parts of the display (EL and ED) in the VT100 is performed thus:
# 
#      Erase from cursor to end of line           Esc [ 0 K    or Esc [ K
#      Erase from beginning of line to cursor     Esc [ 1 K
#      Erase line containing cursor               Esc [ 2 K
#      Erase from cursor to end of screen         Esc [ 0 J    or Esc [ J
#      Erase from beginning of screen to cursor   Esc [ 1 J
#      Erase entire screen                        Esc [ 2 J
#
# Some brain-damaged terminal/emulators respond to Esc [ J as if it were
# Esc [ 2 J, but this is wrong; the default is 0.
# 
# The VT100 responds to receiving the DA (Device Attributes) control
# 
#      Esc [ c    (or Esc [ 0 c)
# 
# by transmitting the sequence
# 
#      Esc [ ? l ; Ps c
# 
# where Ps is a character that describes installed options.
# 
# The VT100's cursor location can be read with the DSR (Device Status
# Report) control
# 
#      Esc [ 6 n
# 
# The VT100 reports by transmitting the CPR sequence
# 
#      Esc [ Pl ; Pc R
# 
# where Pl is the line number and Pc is the column number (in decimal).
# 
# The specification for the DEC VT100 is document EK-VT100-UG-003.

#### ANSI.SYS
# 
# Here is a description of the color and attribute controls supported in the
# the ANSI.SYS driver under MS-DOS.  Most console drivers and ANSI
# terminal emulators for Intel boxes obey these.
#
# 0	all attributes off
# 1	foreground bright
# 4	underscore on
# 5	blink on/background bright (not reliable with brown)
# 7	reverse-video
# 8	set blank (non-display)
# 10	set primary font
# 11	set first alternate font (on PCs, display ROM characters 1-31)
# 12	set second alternate font (on PCs, display IBM high-half chars)
#
#			Color attribute sets
# 3n	set foreground color       / 0=black, 1=red,     2=green, 3=brown,
# 4n	set background color       \ 4=blue,  5=magenta, 6=cyan,  7=white
# Bright black becomes gray.  Bright brown becomes yellow,
# These coincide with the prescriptions of the ISO 6429/ECMA-48 standard.
#
# * If the 5 attribute is on and you set a background color (40-47) it is
#   supposed to enable bright background.
#
# * Many VGA cards (such as the Paradise and compatibles) do the wrong thing
#   when you try to set a "bright brown" (yellow) background with attribute
#   5 (you get a blinking yellow foreground instead).  A few displays
#   (including the System V console) support an attribute 6 that undoes this
#   braindamage (this is required by iBCS2).
#
# * Some older versions of ANSI.SYS have a bug that causes thems to require
#   ESC [ Pn k as EL rather than the ANSI ESC [ Pn K.
#
# The entries following are not standalone.  They are meant to be included
# via use= in other entries.
#

#### Intel Binary Compatibility Standard
#
# For comparison, here are the capabilities implied by the Intel Binary 
# Compatibility Standard for UNIX systems (Intel order number 468366-001).
# These recommendations are optional.  IBCS2 allows the leading escape to
# be either the 7-bit \E[ or 8-bit \0233 introducer, in accordance with
# the ANSI X.364/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 standard.  Here are the iBCS2 capabilities
# (as described in figure 9-3 of the standard).  Those expressed in the ibcs2
# terminfo entry are followed with the corresponding capability in parens:
#
#	CSI <n>k		disable (n=0) or enable (n=1) keyclick
#	CSI 2h   		lock keyboard
#	CSI 2i  		send screen as input
#	CSI 2l  		unlock keyboard
#	CSI 6m  		enable background color intensity

#

######## NONSTANDARD CAPABILITY TRANSLATIONS USED IN THIS FILE
#
# The historical termcap file entries were written primarily in 4.4BSD termcap.
# The 4.4BSD termcap set was substantially larger than the original 4.1BSD set,
# with the extension names chosen for compatibility with the termcap names
# assigned in System V terminfo.  There are some variant extension sets out
# there.  We try to describe them here.
#
# XENIX extensions:
#
# The XENIX extensions include a set of function-key capabilities as follows:
#
#       code	XENIX variable name	terminfo name	name clashes?
#	----	-------------------	-------------	-----------------------
#	CL	key_char_left
#	CR	key_char_right
#	CW	key_change_window			create_window
#	EN	key_end          	kend
#	HM	key_home		khome
#	HP	??
#	LD	key_delete_line  	kdl1
#	LF	key_linefeed     			label_off
#	NU	key_next_unlocked_cell
#	PD	key_page_down   	knp
#	PL	??
#	PN	start_print		mc5
#	PR	??
#	PS	stop_print		mc4
#	PU	key_page_up     	kpp		pulse
#	RC	key_recalc				remove_clock
#	RF	key_toggle_ref				req_for_input
#	RT	key_return      	kent
#	UP	key_up_arrow           	kcuu1   	parm_up_cursor
#	WL	key_word_left
#	WR	key_word_right
#
# The XENIX extensions also include the following character-set and highlight
# capabilities:
#
#	XENIX	terminfo	function
#	-----	--------	------------------------------
#	GS	smacs		start alternate character set
#	GE	rmacs		end alternate character set
#	GG			:as:/:ae: glitch (analogous to :sg:/:ug:)
#	bo	blink		begin blink (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	be			end blink (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	bb			blink glitch  (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	it	dim		begin dim (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	ie			end dim (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	ig			dim glitch  (not used in /etc/termcap)
#
# Finally, XENIX also used the following forms-drawing capabilities:
#
#	single	double  type             ASCII approximation 
#	------	------	-------------    -------------------
#	GV	Gv	vertical line             |
#	GH	Gv	horizontal line       -   _
#	G1	G5	top right corner       _   |
#	G2	G6	top left corner       | 
#	G3	G7	bottom left corner         |_
#	G4	G8	bottom right corner   _|
#	GD	Gd	down-tick character        T
#	GL	Gl	left-tick character   -|
#	GR	Gr	right-tick character       |-
#	GC	Gc	middle intersection   -|-
#	GU	Gu	up-tick character          _|_
#
# These were invented to take advantage of the IBM PC ROM character set.  One
# can compose an acsc string from the single-width characters as follows
#	"j{G4}k{G1}l{G2}m{G3}q{GH}x{GV}t{GR}u{GL}v{GU}w{GD}n{GC}"
# The double forms characters don't fit the SVr4 terminfo model.
#
# AT&T Extensions:
#
# The old AT&T 5410, 5420, 5425, pc6300plus, 610, and s4 entries used a set of
# nonstandard capabilities.  Its signature is the KM capability, used to name
# some sort of keymap file.  EE, BO, CI, CV, XS, DS, FL and FE are in this
# set.  Comments in the original, and a little cross-checking with other AT&T
# documentation, seem to establish that BO=:mr: (start reverse video), DS=:mh:
# (start dim), XS=:mk: (secure/invisible mode), EE=:me: (end highlights),
# FL=:LO: (enable soft labels), FE=:LF: (disable soft labels), CI=:vi: (make
# cursor invisible), and CV=:ve: (make cursor normal).
#
# HP Extensions
#
# The HP library (as of mid-1995, their term.h file version 70.1) appears to
# have the System V capabilities up to SVr1 level.  After that, it supports
# two nonstandard caps meml and memu corresponding to the old termcap :ml:,
# :mu: capabilities.  After that, it supports caps plab_norm, label_on,
# label_off, and key_f11..key_f63 capabilities like SVr4's.  This makes the
# HP binary format incompatible with SVr4's.
#
# IBM Extensions
#
# There is a set of nonstandard terminfos used by IBM's AIX operating system.
# The AIX terminfo library diverged from SVr1 terminfo, and replaces all
# capabilities following prtr_non with the following special capabilties:
# box[12], batt[12], colb[0123456789], colf[0123456789], f[01234567], kbtab,
# kdo, kcmd, kcpn, kend, khlp, knl, knpn, kppn, kppn, kquit, ksel, kscl, kscr,
# ktab, kmpf[123456789], apstr, ksf1..ksf10, kf11...kf63, kact, topl, btml,
# rvert, lvert.   Some of these are identical to XPG4/SVr4 equivalents:
# kcmd, kend, khlp, and kf11...kf63.  Two others (kbtab and ksel) can be
# renamed (to kcbt and kslt).  The places in the box[12] capabilities
# correspond to acsc chars, here is the mapping:
#
#	box1[0]  = ACS_ULCORNER
#	box1[1]  = ACS_HLINE	
#	box1[2]  = ACS_URCORNER
#	box1[3]  = ACS_VLINE
#	box1[4]  = ACS_LRCORNER
#	box1[5]  = ACS_LLCORNER
#	box1[6]  = ACS_TTEE
#	box1[7]  = ACS_RTEE
#	box1[8]  = ACS_BTEE
#	box1[9]  = ACS_LTEE
#	box1[10] = ACS_PLUS
#
# The box2 characters are the double-line versions of these forms graphics.
# The AIX binary terminfo format is incompatible with SVr4's.
#
# TC Extensions:
#
# There is a set of extended termcaps associated with something
# called the "Terminal Control" or TC package created by MainStream Systems,
# Winfield Kansas.  This one also uses GS/GE for as/ae, and also uses
# CF for civis and CO for cvvis.  Finally, they define a boolean :ct:
# that flags color terminals.
#
######## CHANGE HISTORY
#
# The last /etc/termcap version maintained by John Kunze was 8.3, dated 8/5/94.
# Releases 9 and up are maintained by Eric S. Raymond as part of the ncurses
# project.
#
# This file contains all the capability information present in John Kunze's
# last version of the termcap master file, except as noted in the change 
# comments at end of file.  Some information about very ancient obsolete
# capabilities has been moved to comments.  Some all-numeric names of older
# terminals have been retired.
#
# I changed :MT: to :km: (the 4.4BSD name) everywhere.  I commented out some
# capabilities (EP, dF, dT, dV, kn, ma, ml, mu, xr, xx) that are no longer
# used by BSD curses.
#
# The 9.1.0 version of this file was translated from my lightly-edited copy of
# 8.3, then mechanically checked against 8.3 using Emacs Lisp code written for
# the purpose.  Unless the ncurses tic implementation and the Lisp code were
# making perfectly synchronized mistakes which I then failed to catch by
# eyeball, the translation was correct and perfectly information-preserving.
#
# Here is a log of the changes since then:
#
# 9.1.0 (Wed Feb  1 04:50:32 EST 1995):

#
# 9.7.0 (Tue May  9 18:03:12 EDT 1995):
#	* Added vt320-k3, rsvidtx from the Emacs termcap.dat file.  I think
#	  that captures everything unique from it.
#	* Added reorder script generator.
#	* Freeze for ncurses 1.9.2 release.
# 9.7.1 (Thu Jun 29 09:35:22 EDT 1995):
#	* Added Sean Farley's kspd, flash, rs1 capabilities for linux.
#	* Added Olaf Siebert's corrections for adm12.

#	* The linux entry can now recognize the center (keypad 5) key.
#	* Removed some junk that found its way into Linux acsc.
#
# 9.8.0 (Fri Jul  7 04:46:57 EDT 1995):

#	* Added csr capability to linux entry.
#	* Peter Wemm says the at386 hpa should be \E[%i%p1%dG, not \E[%p1%dG.
#	* Added vt102-nsgr to cope with stupid IBM PC `VT100' emulators.
#	* Some commented-out caps in long entries come back in, my code 
#	  for computing string-table lengths had a bug in it.
#	* pcansi series modified to fit comm-program reality better.
# 9.8.2 (Sat Sep  9 23:35:00 EDT 1995):
#	* BSD/OS actually ships the ibmpc3 bold entry as its console.
#	* Correct some bad aliases in the pcansi series
#	* Added entry for QNX console.
#	* Clean up duplicate long names for use with 4.4 library.
#	* Change vt100 standout to be normal reverse vide, not bright reverse;
#	  this makes the Emacs status line look better.

#	* Changed xterm lines to 24, the X11R6 default.
# 9.9.2 (Sat Sep 23 21:29:21 EDT 1995):
#	* Added 7 newly discovered, undocumented acsc characters to linux
#	  entry (the pryz{|} characters).
#	* ncurses no longer steals A_PROTECT.  Simplify linux sgr accordingly.
#	* Correct two typos in the xterm entries introduced in 9.9.1.
#	* I finally figured out how to translate ko capabilities.  Done.
#	* Added tvi921 entries from Tim Theisen.
#	* Cleanup: dgd211 -> dg211, adm42-nl -> adm42-nsl.
#	* Removed mystery tec entry, it was neither interesting nor useful.
#	* shortened altos3, qvt203, tvi910+, tvi92D, tvi921-g, tvi955, vi200-f,
#	  vi300-ss, att505-24, contel301, dm3045, f200vi, pe7000c, vc303a,
#	  trs200, wind26, wind40, wind50, cdc456tst, dku7003, f110, dg211,
#	  by making them relative to use capabilities
#	* Added cuf1=^L to tvi925 from deleted variant tvi925a.
#	* fixed cup in adm22 entry and parametrized strings in vt320-k3.
#	* added it#8 to entries that used to have :pt: -- tvi912, vi200,
#	  ampex80,
#	* Translate all home=\E[;H capabilities to home=\E[H, they're 
#	  equivalent.
#	* Translate \E[0m -> \E[m in [rs]mso, [rs]mul, and init strings of
#	  vt100 and ANSI-like terminals.
# 9.9.3 (Tue Sep 26 20:11:15 EDT 1995):
#	* Added it#8 and ht=\t to *all* entries with :pt:; the ncurses tic
#	  does this now, too.
#	* fviewpoint is gone, it duplicated screwpoint.
#	* Added hp2627, graphos, graphos-30, hpex, ibmega, ibm8514, ibm8514-c,
#	  ibmvga, ibmvga-c, minix, mm340, mt4520-rv, screen2, screen3, 
#	  versaterm, vi500, vsc, vt131, vt340, vt400 entries from UW.
#	  The UW vi50 replaces the old one, which becomes vi50adm,
#	* No more embedded commas in name fields.
#
# 9.10.0 (Wed Oct  4 15:39:37 EDT 1995):
#	* XENIX forms characters in fos, trs16, scoansi become acsc strings,
#	* Introduced klone+* entries for describing Intel-console behavior.
#	* Linux kbs is default-mapped to delete for some brain-dead reason.
#	* -nsl -> -ns.  The -pp syntax is obsolete.
#	* Eliminate [A-Z]* primaries in accordance with SVr4 terminfo docs.
#	* Make xterm entry do application-keypad mode again.  I got complaints
#	  that it was messing up someone's 3270 emulator.
#	* Added some longname fields in order to avoid warning messages from
#	  older tic implementations.
#	* According to ctrlseqs.ms, xterm has a full vt100 graphics set.  Use
#	  it! (This gives us pi, greater than, less than, and a few more.)
#	* Freeze for ncurses-1.9.6 release.
# 9.10.1 (Sat Oct 21 22:18:09 EDT 1995):
#	* Add xon to a number of console entries, they're memory-mapped and
#	  don't need padding.
#	* Correct the use dependencies in the ansi series.
#	* Hand-translate more XENIX capabilities.
#	* Added hpterm entry for HP's X terminal emulator.
#	* Added aixterm entries.
#	* Shortened four names so everything fits in 14 chars.  
#

######## REORDER
#
# Older termcap distributions featured a kluge called `reorder' intended to
# time-optimize access to selected terminals by moving them to the front of
# the file.  This is obsolete under terminfo, but for completeness's sake
# we give a reorder script generator here (strip off the leading #s to use).
#
#: mkreorder --  generate script to optimize access to given terminal types
#:
#: entries named on command line will be sorted to the front in reverse order
#echo "ed -- termcap <<EOF"
#for x in $*
#do
#	echo "/^$x[|:]/;.,/^[a-z#]/-1m0"
#done
#echo "0a"
#echo "."
#echo "w termcap.sorted"
#echo "q"
#echo "EOF"
#:end of script
#
# Invoke this script like this:
#
#	mkreorder h19 wy60 vt100 >reorder
#
# The following sets edit modes for GNU EMACS
# Local Variables:
# fill-prefix:"\t"
# fill-column:75
# End:
