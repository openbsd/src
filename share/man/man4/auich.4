.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "auich* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "audio* at auich?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the AC97-based audio present on the Intel
82801AA/AB/BA/CA I/O controller hub (ICH/ICH0/ICH2/ICH3) and 82440MX chipset.
The
.Nm
DMA engine supports full-duplex operation and has separate channels
for line input and microphone.
Unfortunately, simultaneous recording from both line and microphone inputs
is not supported due to the current
.Xr ac97 4
design.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ac97 4 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Some hardware implementations only support 48kHz sampling rates.
