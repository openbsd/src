.Sh NAME
.Nm iic
.Nd Inter IC (I2C) bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iic* at gscsio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn I2C
is a two-wire bus developed by Philips used for connecting
integrated circuits.
It is commonly used for connecting devices such as EEPROMs,
temperature sensors, fan controllers, real-time clocks, tuners,
and other types of integrated circuits.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides uniform programming interface layer between
.Tn I2C
master controllers and various
.Tn I2C
slave devices.
Each
.Tn I2C
master controller attaches an
.Xr iic 4
framework, several slave devices can be attached then to the
.Xr iic 4
bus.
.Pp
All
.Tn I2C
slave devices are uniquely identified by the address on the bus.
Master accesses particular slave device using its address.
Device address should be specified in the kernel configuration file
with the
.Cd addr
locator.
.Pp
System Management Bus (SMBus) protocol is also supported by emulating
it with the
.Tn I2C
commands.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Tn I2C
framework first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 3.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Tn I2C
framework was written by
Steve C. Woodford and Jason R. Thorpe for
.Nx
and then ported to
.Ox
by
.An Alexander Yurchenko Aq grange@openbsd.org .
