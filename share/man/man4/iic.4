.Sh NAME
.Nm iic
.Nd Inter IC (I2C) bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iic* at gscsio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn I2C
is a two-wire bus developed by Philips used for connecting
integrated circuits.
It is commonly used for connecting devices such as EEPROMs,
temperature sensors, fan controllers, real-time clocks, tuners,
and other types of integrated circuits.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a uniform programming interface layer between
.Tn I2C
master controllers and various
.Tn I2C
slave devices.
Each
.Tn I2C
master controller attaches an
.Nm
framework; several slave devices can then be attached to the
.Nm
bus.
.Pp
All
.Tn I2C
slave devices are uniquely identified by the address on the bus.
The master accesses a particular slave device using its address.
Device addresses should be specified in the kernel configuration file
with the
.Cd addr
locator.
.Pp
System Management Bus (SMBus) protocol is also supported by emulating
it with the
.Tn I2C
commands.
