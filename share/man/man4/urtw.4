.Sh NAME
.Nm urtw
.Nd Realtek RTL8187L/RTL8187B USB IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "urtw* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports USB 802.11b/g wireless adapters based on the
Realtek RTL8187L and RTL8187B.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the current encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
The
.Nm
driver relies on the software 802.11 stack for both encryption and decryption
of data frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The following adapters should work:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Alfa AWUS036H
.It ASUS P5B Deluxe
.It Belkin F5D7050E
.It Digitus DN-7003GT
.It Linksys WUSB54GC v2
.It Netgear WG111v2
.It Netgear WG111v3
.It Shuttle XPC Accessory PN20
.It Sitecom WL-168 v1
.It Sitecom WL-168 v4
.It Surecom EP-9001-g rev 2A
.It TRENDnet TEW-424UB V3.xR
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example scans for available networks:
.Pp
.Dl # ifconfig urtw0 scan
.Pp
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures urtw0 to join network
.Dq mynwid ,
using WPA key
.Dq mywpakey ,
obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nwid mynwid
wpakey mywpakey
dhcp
