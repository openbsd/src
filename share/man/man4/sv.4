.Sh NAME
.Nm sv
.Nd S3 SonicVibes device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sv* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "audio* at sv?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support S3 SonicVibes (S3-617) chipset-based
cards. Disabling the SRS 3-D spatial feature of the chip is
recommended for higher quality audio. This can be done in software
by issuing the 
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mixerctl -w outputs.spatial=off
.Ed

command.

.Sh BUGS
The "FM" DAC, wavetable synth, and MIDI port are not
supported. Recording at a rate different from playback is supported by
the chip but not the driver. The mixer does not allow control of reverb,
digital loopback, or 3-D SRS features. The chip does not support exact
record speeds (it seems) of 11025hz, 22050hz, and so on, used by
Windows audio. Usually, the actual record is rate is around +/- 50hz of
the specified.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr mixer 4
.Sh HISTORY
This driver is based on the eap driver by Lennart Augustsson.
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
