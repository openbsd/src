.Sh NAME
.Nm ec
.Nd device driver for 3Com Etherlink II (3c503) Ethernet cards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ec0 at isa? port 0x250 iomem 0xd8000 irq 9"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports 3Com Etherlink II (3c503) Ethernet cards.
.Pp
Other models of 3Com hardware are supported by the
.Xr xl 4 ,
.Xr ep 4 ,
and
.Xr eg 4
drivers.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The Etherlink II supports two media types on a single card.  All support
the AUI media type.  The other media is either BNC or UTP behind a
transciever.  Software cannot differentiate between BNC and UTP cards.
.Pp
To enable the AUI media, select the
.Em 10base5
or
.Em aui
media type with
.Xr ifconfig 8 's
.Sq media
directive.  To select the other media (BNC or UTP), select the
.Em 10base2
or
.Em bnc
media type.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ec0: wildcarded IRQ is not allowed"
The IRQ was wildcarded in the kernel configuration file.  This is not
supported.
.It "ec0: invalid IRQ <n>, must be 3, 4, 5, or 9"
An IRQ other than the above listed IRQs was specified in the kernel
configuration file.  The Etherlink II hardware only supports the
above listed IRQs.
.It "ec0: failed to clear shared memory at offset <off>"
The memory test was unable to clear shared the interface's shared memory
region.  This often indicates that the card is configured at a conflicting
.Em iomem
address.
