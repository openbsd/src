.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd Ethernet driver for AMD7990(LANCE)-based boards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le* at pcc0 offset 0x1800 ipl 1" Pq "onboard interface"
.Cd "le* at vmes0 addr 0xffff1200 ipl 1 vec 0x74 len 0x100" Pq "MVME376"
.Cd "le* at vmes0 addr 0xffff1400 ipl 1 vec 0x75 len 0x100" Pq "MVME376"
.Cd "le* at vmes0 addr 0xffff1600 ipl 1 vec 0x76 len 0x100" Pq "MVME376"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the following mvme68k hardware:
.Bl -tag -width "onboard" -offset indent
.It Em onboard
MVME147 onboard ethernet interface
.It Em MVME376
MVME376 VMEbus ethernet card
.El
.Sh HISTORY
The mvme68k
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Ox 2.0
