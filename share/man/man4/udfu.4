.Sh NAME
.Nm udfu
.Nd Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) Attach
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "udfu*     at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver configures a DFU-compatible device such as the Openmoko telephone
into DFU mode, then detaches it,
permitting it to be attached for read/write access as a
.Xr ugen 4
device to re-flash the memory.
.Pp
Note that this interferes with using the
.Xr umodem 4
interface to this device, which is sometimes needed for manual re-configuration.
To enable the use of
.Xr umodem 4 ,
it is necessary to disable
.Nm ,
either permanently in the kernel configuration file or using
.Xr boot_config 8 .
.Sh SEE ALSO

.\" The

.Nm
driver
first appeared in
.Ox 4.5 .
