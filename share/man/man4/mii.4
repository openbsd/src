.Sh DESCRIPTION
Media Independent Interface is an IEEE standard serial bus for
connecting MACs (network controllers) to PHYs (physical media
interfaces).
The
.Nm
layer allows network device drivers to share support code for
various PHY models, and allows unused support for PHYs which
are not present in a system to be removed from the kernel.
.Pp
Network device drivers which use the
.Nm
layer carry the
.Dq mii
autoconfiguration attribute.
This allows kernel configuration files to simply specify PHYs as
described above in
.Sx SYNOPSIS .
.Pp
The following is an example of the messages displayed when a network
interface with an attached PHY is detected by the kernel:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hme0 at sbus0 slot 1 offset 0x8c00000 pri 7: address 08:00:20:22:86:b8 rev 34
nsphy0 at hme0 phy 1: DP83840 10/100 PHY, rev. 1
.Ed
.Pp
.Xr ifconfig 8
can be used to display the media types supported by the PHY.
These media types are valid media keywords for use with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
program.
