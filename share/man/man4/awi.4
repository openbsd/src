.Nm awi
.Nd BayStack 650 IEEE 802.11FH PCMCIA wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "awi* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Bay Networks BayStack 650 IEEE 802.11
Frequency Hopping PCCARD adapters.
.Pp
The BayStack 650 is based on an AMD 79c930 controller, which provides
access to 32kb of memory shared between the controller and the host.
All host/device interaction is via this shared memory, which can be
accessed either via PCMCIA memory space or I/O space.
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames.
Transmit speed is fixed at 1Mbps.
.Pp
The driver currently only works in infrastructure mode, communicating
with an Access Point which serves as a link-layer bridge between an
Ethernet and the wireless network.
.Pp
This card seems to take between 5 and 20 seconds after it has been brought up
to synchronize with an AP.
When using
.Xr dhclient 8
to automatically configure an address on this card, it may be
advisable to delay the invocation of dhclient for about 10 seconds
after the card is brought up using
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "awi0: unable to allocate memory space; using i/o only"
Indicates that the driver was not able to allocate 32kb of PCMCIA bus
address space into which to map the device; the driver will use the
(slightly slower) i/o-space only access methods to read and write to
the shared memory.
This message is in some sense to be expected and
should not be a cause for alarm.
See
.Xr pcmcia 4
for information on how to increase the memory available to the PCMCIA
controller.
.It "awi0: selftest failed (code %x)"
The device failed to pass its internal selftest.
.It "awi0: device failed to complete selftest (code %x)"
The device failed to complete its self test within 5 seconds.
.It "awi0: device timeout"
.It "awi0: timeout waiting for command completion"
The device failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a command.
.It "awi0: transmit timeout"
The device failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a
transmitted packet.
.It "awi0: large frame truncated"
The system handed the driver a packet which was too large to transmit
in one piece.
.It "awi0: device enable failed"
The system was unable to power on the card.
.It "awi0: associated with %s, SSID: %s"
The device has successfully synchronized with the identified Access
Point and is ready to relay traffic.
.It "awi0: no recent beacon from %s; rescanning"
The device has not heard a beacon from its currently associated Access
Point recently, and is looking for a new access point.
.It "awi0: received deauth"
The access point the card was most recently associated with has
forgotten about us.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Sommerfeld Aq sommerfeld@netbsd.org
and ported to
.Ox
by
.An Angelos D. Keromytis Aq angelos@dsl.cis.upenn.edu
.Sh BUGS
Doesn't support ad-hoc mode or WEP.
Round trip times seem higher than what one might expect.
