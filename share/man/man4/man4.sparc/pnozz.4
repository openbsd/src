.Sh NAME
.Nm pnozz
.Nd Weitek Power9100 accelerated frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pnozz0 at sbus?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at pnozz?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a color frame buffer with graphics acceleration, embedded in the
.Tn Tadpole SPARCbook
3GS, 3GX, 3TX and 3XP
laptops.
It is based on the
.Tn Weitek Power9100
video processor and an
.Tn IBM RGB525
RAMDAC.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Pp
If the
.Xr tctrl 4
device is also configured, the
.Nm
will be powered down when the lid of the laptop
is closed or the screen is blanked.
