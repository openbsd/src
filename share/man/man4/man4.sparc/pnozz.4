.Sh NAME
.Nm pnozz
.Nd Weitek Power9100 accelerated frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pnozz0 at sbus? flags 0x0"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at pnozz?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a color frame buffer with graphics acceleration, embedded in the
.Tn Tadpole SPARCbook
3GS, 3GX, 3TX and 3XP
laptops.
It is based on the
.Tn Weitek Power9100
video processor and an
.Tn IBM RGB525
RAMDAC.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Pp
If the
.Xr tctrl 4
device is also configured, the
.Nm
will be powered down when the lid of the laptop
is closed or the screen is blanked.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports hardware acceleration to erase the screen and scroll text.
By default, acceleration is
.Em not
enabled.
By setting
.Ar flags
to 1
(via
.Xr config 8
or
.Xr boot_config 8 )
this acceleration can be enabled.
.Sh EXTERNAL VIDEO
If the
.Xr tctrl 4
device is also configured, the external video output will be enabled when
an external display is connected, even if the laptop lid is closed.
