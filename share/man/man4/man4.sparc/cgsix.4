.Sh NAME
.Nm cgsix
.Nd accelerated 8-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cgsix* at sbus? slot ? offset ?" Pq "sun4c and sun4m"
.Cd "cgsix0 at obio0 addr 0xfb000000 level 4" Pq sun4/300 P4
.Cd "cgsix0 at obio0 addr 0x0b000000 level 4" Pq sun4/100 P4
.Cd "wsdisplay* at cgsix?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a memory based color frame buffer for the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.

.Sh BUGS
Several firmware revisions of the
.Nm cgsix ,
in particular those found in the SparcStation 5, have a
bug that occurs when the screen control sequences for inserting blank lines
(e.g., the control sequences produced by the
.So al Sc and So AL Sc
capabilities found in the
.Xr termcap 5
database) are used near the bottom end of the screen.
This bug is most likely to be encountered during the
use of a full-screen editor such as
.Xr vi 1
on the workstation's console.
.Pp
To work around this bug, the
.Ev TERM
environment variable should be set to
.Sq sun-ss5 ,
which is the same as the
.Sq sun
entry except without the
.Sq al
and
.Sq AL
capabilities.
