.Sh NAME
.Nm cgfourteen
.Nd accelerated 8/24-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cgfourteen0 at obio0" Pq "SS10-M and SS20"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm cgfourteen
is a memory based color frame buffer, with graphics acceleration and
overlay capabilities. Its pixel memory can be mapped into a user process 
address space by using
the
.Xr mmap 2
system call. The
.Nm
driver supports the minimal ioctl's needed to run
.Xr X 1 .
.Pp
The driver operates by default in
.Xr cgthree 4
emulation mode, i.e. in 8-bit unaccelerated mode. This
emulation does include support for the hardware cursor present on the
.Nm cgfourteen , 
however.
