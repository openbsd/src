.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is an on-board or SBus SCSI controller based on the NCR 53c94 chip, found
on Sun 4/300, sun4c and sun4m workstations.
.Sh DEVICE FLAGS
.Bl -tag -width "Bits XX-XX" -compact
.It Bits 0-7
Disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
.It Bits 8-15
Disable synchronous negotiation for target "[bit - 8]"
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
device flags may be OR'd together to enable any combination of
the features listed above.
Targets 4 through 7 typically have disconnect/reselect enabled on the premise
that tape devices normally have one of these targets.
Tape devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus to operate
acceptably.
