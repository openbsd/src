.Sh NAME
.Nm puc
.Nd PCI
.Dq universal
communications card driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "puc* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "com* at puc? port ?"
or
.Cd "pccom* at puc? port ?"
.Cd "lpt* at puc? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI communications cards containing
simple communications ports, such as NS16550-family
.Pf ( Nm com )
serial ports and standard PC-like
.Pf ( Nm lpt )
parallel ports.
The driver is called
.Dq universal
because the interfaces to these devices aren't nearly as well
defined and standard as they should be.
.Pp
The driver currently supports the following cards:

.El
.Pp
The driver does not support these cards:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.It Tn "Dolphin Peripherals 4006 (single parallel)"
.It Tn "Dolphin Peripherals 4025 (single serial)"
.It Tn "Dolphin Peripherals 4078 (dual serial and single parallel)"
.El
.Pp
but support for them (and for similar cards) should be trivial to add.
.Pp
The
.Ar port
locator is used to identify the port (starting from 0) on the
communications card that a subdevice is supposed to attach to.
Typically, the numbering of ports is explained in a card's
hardware documentation, and the port numbers used by the driver
are the same as (or one off from, e.g., the manual uses ports
numbered starting from 1) those described in the documentation.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by Chris Demetriou.
.Sh BUGS
The current design of this driver keeps any
.Nm com
ports on these cards from easily being used as console.
Of course, because boards with those are PCI boards, they also suffer
from dynamic address assignment, which also means that they
can't easily be used as console.
.Pp
Some of cards supported by this driver have jumper-selectable
.Nm com
port clock multipliers, which are unsupported by this driver.
Those can be easily accommodated with driver flags, or by
using a properly scaled baud rate when talking to the card.
.Pp
Some of the cards supported by this driver, e.g., the VScom PCI-800,
have software-selectable
.Nm com
port clock multipliers, which are unsupported by this driver.
Those can be accommodated using internal driver flags, or by using
a properly scaled baud rate when talking to the card.
.Pp
Some ports use an
.Nm lpt
driver other than the machine-independent driver.
Those ports will not be able to use
.Nm lpt
ports attached to
.Nm
devices.
