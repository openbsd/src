.Sh NAME
.Nm trunk
.Nd link aggregation and link failover interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device trunk" Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface allows aggregation of multiple network interfaces as one virtual
.Nm
interface.
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface can be created using the
.Ic ifconfig trunk Ns Ar N Ic create
command.
It can use different link aggregation protocols specified
using the
.Ic trunkproto Ar proto
option.
Child interfaces can be added using the
.Ic trunkport Ar child-iface
option and removed using the
.Ic -trunkport Ar child-iface
option.
.Pp
The driver currently supports the trunk protocols
.Ic roundrobin
.Oo
.Ic default
.Oc ,
.Ic failover ,
and
.Ic none
for link aggregation and link failover.
.Pp
The configuration can be done at runtime or by setting up a
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration file for
.Xr netstart 8 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a simple round robin trunk with two bge(4) gigabit ethernet
interfaces:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig bge0 up
# ifconfig bge1 up
# ifconfig trunk0 create
# ifconfig trunk0 trunkport bge0 trunkport bge1 192.168.1.1 \e
	netmask 255.255.255.0 up
.Ed
.Pp
The following example uses an active failover trunk to realise roaming
between wired and wireless networks using two network devices.
Whenever the wired master interface is unplugged, the wireless failover
device will be used:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig em0 up
# ifconfig ath0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 nwid my_net up
# ifconfig trunk0 create
# ifconfig trunk0 trunkport em0 trunkport ath0 192.168.1.1 \e
	netmask 255.255.255.0 up
