.Nd Hifn 6500 crypto accelerator driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lofn* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards using the
.Tn Hifn 6500
public key processor.
This chip has both a random number generator and a large
number processor.
The random number generator provides random bits to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem, while the large number processor registers with the
.Xr crypto 4
subsystem to support modular exponentiation.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3 ,
.Xr crypto 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
