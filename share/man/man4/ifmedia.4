.Sh NAME
.Nm ifmedia
.Nd network interface media settings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Fd #include <net/if.h>
.Fd #include <net/if_media.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides a consistent method for querying and setting
network inerface media and media options.  The media is typically
set using the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.
.Pp
There are currently three link types supported by
.Nm Ns :
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width IFM_ETHER
.It IFM_ETHER
Ethernet
.It IFM_TOKEN
Token Ring
.It IFM_FDDI
FDDI
.El
.Pp
The following sections describe the possible media settings for each
link type.  Not all of these are supported by every device; refer to
your device's manual page for more information.
.Pp
The lists below provide the possible names of each media type or option.
The first name in the list is the canonical name of the media type or
option.  Additional names are acceptable aliases for the media type or
option.
.Sh COMMON MEDIA TYPES AND OPTIONS
The followng media types are shared by all link types:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width IFM_MANUAL
.It IFM_AUTO
Autoselect the best media.  [autoselect, auto]
.It IFM_MANUAL
Jumper or switch on device selects media.  [manual]
.It IFM_NONE
Deselect all media.  [none]
.El
.Pp
The following media options are shared by all link types:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width IFM_FLAG0
.It IFM_FDX
Place the device into full-duplex mode.  This option only has meaning
if the device is normally not full-duplex.  [full-duplex, fdx]
.It IFM_HDX
Place the device into half-duplex mode.  This option only has meaning
if the device is normally not half-duplex.  [half-duplex, hdx]
.It IFM_FLAG0
Driver-defined flag.  [flag0]
.It IFM_FLAG1
Driver-defined flag.  [flag1]
.It IFM_FLAG2
Driver-defined flag.  [flag2]
.It IFM_LOOP
Place the device into hardware loopback mode.  [loopback, hw-loopback, loop]
.El
.Sh MEDIA TYPES AND OPTIONS FOR ETHERNET
The following media types are defined for Ethernet:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width IFM_1000_FX

connector.  [100baseT4, 100T4]
.It IFM_100_VG
100baseVG AnyLAN.  [100baseVG, 100VG]
.It IFM_100_T2

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Bsx 3.0 .
The implementation that appeared in
.Nx 1.3
was written by Jonathan Stone and Jason R. Thorpe to be compatible with
the BSDI API.  It has since gone through several revisions which have
extended the API while maintaining backwards compatibility with the
original API.
