Note that the channels do overlap; the bandwidth required for
each channel is about 20MHz.
When using multiple channels in close proximity it is suggested
that channels be separated by at least 25MHz.
In the US, this means that only channels 1, 6, and 11 may be used
simultaneously without interference.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Bsx 3.0 .
The implementation that appeared in
.Nx 1.3
was written by Jonathan Stone and Jason R. Thorpe to be compatible with
the BSDI API.
It has since gone through several revisions which have extended the
API while maintaining backwards compatibility with the original API.
.Pp
Support for the
.Sy IEEE802.11 Wireless LAN
link type was added in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Pp
.Sy Host AP
mode was added in
.Ox 3.1 .
