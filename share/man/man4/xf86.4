.Sh NAME
.Nm xf86
.Nd XFree86 aperture driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "option APERTURE"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
On
.Va alpha ,
.Va amd64 ,
.Va cats ,
.Va i386 ,
.Va macppc ,
and
.Va sparc64
the
.Pa /dev/xf86
driver provides access to the memory and I/O ports of a VGA board
and to the PCI configuration registers
for use by the XFree86 X servers
when running with a kernel security level > 0.
.Pp
The X servers require the use of this driver.
.Sh ACCESS CONTROL
Access to the
.Pa /dev/xf86
device is allowed when the sysctl variable
.Va machdep.allowaperture
>= 1.
This variable (which has a default value of 0)
can only be manipulated when the security level is <= 0, so it should be
set in
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf .
The possible values for
.Va machdep.allowaperture
are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
the aperture driver is disabled.
Opening it returns
.Dv EPERM .
.It 1
the aperture driver allows access to standard VGA framebuffer and BIOS.
Access to
.Xr pci 4
configuration registers is also allowed.
.It 2
in addition to allowing access to
.Xr pci 4
configuration registers,
the aperture driver allows access to the whole 1st megabyte of physical
memory, permitting use of the int10 emulation in XFree86 4.0.x.
Note that this can cause some security problems, since the process that
has access to the aperture driver can also access part of the kernel
memory.
This mode is not supported on alpha or sparc64.

.Sh HISTORY
.Pa /dev/xf86
was introduced as a loadable kernel module for
.Nx 0.9 c
with XFree86 3.1.
It was integrated as an in-kernel device on
.Ox 2.3 .
It is required in order to allow access to I/O ports for all X servers since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The aperture driver was written by Matthieu Herrb.
.Sh BUGS
This driver allows access to all addresses above
.Va physmem .
It should be restricted to the actual address range of the video
memory.
