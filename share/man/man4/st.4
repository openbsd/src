.Sh NAME
.Nm st
.Nd SCSI tape driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "st* at scsibus? target ? lun ?"
.Cd "#st0 at scsibus0 target 4 lun 0" Pq fixed-configuration example
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for
.Tn SCSI
tape drives.
It allows a tape drive to be run in several different modes depending
on minor numbers and supports several different
.Dq sub-modes .
The device can have both a
.Em raw
interface and a
.Em block
interface; however, only the raw interface is usually used (or recommended).
.Pp
.Tn SCSI
devices have a relatively high level interface and talk to the system via a
.Tn SCSI
adapter and a
.Tn SCSI
adapter driver
(e.g.,
.Xr ahc 4 ) .
A
.Tn SCSI
adapter must also be separately configured into the system before a
.Tn SCSI
tape can be configured.
.Pp
As the
.Tn SCSI
adapter is probed during boot, the
.Tn SCSI
bus is scanned for devices.
Any devices found which answer as
.Sq Em Sequential
type devices will be attached to the
.Nm
driver.
.Sh MOUNT SESSIONS
The
.Nm
driver is based around the concept of a
.Dq Em mount session ,
which is defined as the period between the time that a tape is
mounted, and the time when it is unmounted.
Any parameters set during a mount session remain in effect for the remainder
of the session or until replaced.
The tape can be unmounted, bringing the session to a close in several ways.
These include:
.Bl -enum
.It
Closing an
.Dq unmount device ,
referred to as sub-mode 00 below.
An example is
.Pa /dev/rst0 .
.It
Using the
.Dv MTOFFL
.Xr ioctl 2
command, reachable through the
.Sq Cm offline
command of
.Xr mt 1 .
.It
Opening a different mode will implicitly unmount the tape, thereby
closing off the mode that was previously mounted.
All parameters will be loaded freshly from the new mode.
(See below for more on modes.)
.El
.Sh MODES AND SUB-MODES
There are several different
.Sq operation
modes.
These are controlled by bits 2 and 3 of the minor number
and are designed to allow users to easily read and write different
formats of tape on devices that allow multiple formats.
The parameters for each mode can be set individually by hand with the
.Xr mt 1
command.
When a device corresponding to a particular mode is first
mounted, the operating parameters for that mount session are copied
from that mode.
Further changes to the parameters during the session will change those in
effect for the session but not those set in the operation mode.
To change the parameters for an operation mode, one must compile them into the
.Dq Em quirk
table in the driver's source code.
.Pp
In addition to the operating modes mentioned above, bits 0 and 1
of the minor number are interpreted as
.Sq sub-modes .
The sub-modes differ in the action taken when the device is closed:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It 00
A close will rewind the device; if the tape has been written, then
a file mark will be written before the rewind is requested.
The device is unmounted.
.It 01
A close will leave the tape mounted.
If the tape was written to, a file mark will be written.
No other head positioning takes place.
Any further reads or writes will occur directly after the last
read, or the written file mark.
.It 10
A close will rewind the device.
If the tape has been written, then a file mark will be written before the
rewind is requested.
On completion of the rewind an unload command will be issued.
The device is unmounted.
.It 11
Reserved.
Currently unused.
.El
.Sh BLOCKING MODES
.Tn SCSI
tapes may run in either
.Sq Em variable
or
.Sq Em fixed
block-size modes.
Most
.Tn QIC Ns -type
devices run in fixed block-size mode, where most nine-track tapes
and many new cartridge formats allow variable block-size.
The difference between the two is as follows:
.Bl -inset
.It Variable block-size:
Each write made to the device results in a single logical record
written to the tape.
One can never read or write
.Em part
of a record from tape (though you may request a larger block and
read a smaller record); nor can one read multiple blocks.
Data from a single write is therefore read by a single read.
The block size used may be any value supported by the device, the
.Tn SCSI
adapter and the system (usually between 1 byte and 64 Kbytes,
sometimes more).
.Pp
When reading a variable record/block from the tape, the head is
logically considered to be immediately after the last item read,
and before the next item after that.
If the next item is a file mark, but it was never read, then the next
process to read will immediately hit the file mark and receive an
end-of-file notification.
.It Fixed block-size
data written by the user is passed to the tape as a succession of
fixed size blocks.
It may be contiguous in memory, but it is considered to be a series of
independent blocks.
One may never write an amount of data that is not an exact multiple of the
blocksize.
One may read and write the same data as a different set of records.
In other words, blocks that were written together may be read separately,
and vice-versa.
.Pp
If one requests more blocks than remain in the file, the drive will
encounter the file mark.
Because there is some data to return (unless there were no records before
the file mark), the read will succeed, returning that data.
The next read will return immediately with an
.Dv EOF .
(As above, if the file mark is never read, it remains for the next process
to read if in no-rewind mode.)
.El
.Sh FILE MARK HANDLING
The handling of file marks on write is automatic.
If the user has written to the tape, and has not done a read since the last
write, then a file mark will be written to the tape when the device is closed.
If a rewind is requested after a write, then the driver
assumes that the last file on the tape has been written, and ensures
that there are two file marks written to the tape.
The exception to this is that there seems to be a standard (which we follow,
but don't understand why) that certain types of tape do not actually
write two file marks to tape, but when read, report a
.Dq phantom
file mark when the last file is read.
These devices include the QIC family of devices.
(It might be that this set of devices is the same set as that of fixed
This has not yet been determined, and they are treated as separate
behaviors by the driver at this time.)
.Sh KERNEL CONFIGURATION
Because different tape drives behave differently, there is a
mechanism within the source to
.Nm
to quickly and conveniently recognize and deal with brands and
models of drive that have special requirements.
.Pp
There is a table (called the
.Dq Em quirk table )
in which the identification strings of known errant drives can be stored.
Alongside each is a set of flags that allows the setting
of densities and blocksizes for each of the modes, along with a
set of
.Dq QUIRK
flags that can be used to enable or disable sections
of code within the driver if a particular drive is recognized.
.Sh IOCTLS
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls apply to
.Tn SCSI
tapes.
Some also apply to other tapes.
They are defined in the header file
.Fd <sys/mtio.h> .

.\" Almost all of this discussion belongs in a separate mt(4)
.\" manual page, since it is common to all magnetic tapes.

.It Dv MTIOCGET
.Pq Li "struct mtget"
Retrieve the status and parameters of the tape.
.It Dv MTIOCTOP
