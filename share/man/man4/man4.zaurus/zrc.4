.Sh NAME
.Nm zrc
.Nd Zaurus remote control support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "zrc0     at pxaip?"
.Cd "wskbd*   at zrc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the CE-RH2 remote control that can be
plugged into the headphone jack of the Zaurus C1000, C3000 and C3100.
Access to the additional keys generated by the remote control is
through the
.Xr wskbd 4
driver.
.Pp
In translated mode (when not running X) the keys generated by
pressing the buttons on the remote control are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxxxxxxxx" -compact -offset indent
.It Li Mute
m
.It Li Volume Down
-
.It Li Volume Up
+
.It Li Rewind
b
.It Li Forward
f
.It Li Play/Pause
p
.It Li Stop
s
.El
.Pp
In raw mode (when running X) the following keycodes are generated:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxxxxxxxx" -compact -offset indent
.It Li Mute
133
.It Li Volume Down
134
.It Li Volume Up
135
.It Li Rewind
160
.It Li Forward
161
.It Li Play/Pause
162
.It Li Stop
163
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Sample
.Pa ~/.Xmodmap
configuration file that can be loaded with
.Xr xmodmap 1 ,
or automatically when
.Xr X 1
starts:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
! Map to xmms control keys; mute becomes "shuffle"
keycode 133 = s
keycode 134 = Down
keycode 135 = Up
keycode 160 = z
keycode 161 = b
keycode 162 = x
keycode 163 = v
.Ed
.Pp
To control applications that handle the standard audio keysyms, this
configuration can be used instead:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
! Map to standard audio keysyms
keycode 133 = XF86AudioMute
keycode 134 = XF86AudioLowerVolume
keycode 135 = XF86AudioRaiseVolume
keycode 160 = XF86AudioPrev
keycode 161 = XF86AudioNext
keycode 162 = XF86AudioPlay
keycode 163 = XF86AudioStop
