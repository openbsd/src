.Sh NAME
.Nm pf
.Nd packet filter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device pf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Packet filtering takes place in the kernel.
A pseudo-device,
.Pa /dev/pf ,
allows userland processes to control the
behavior of the packet filter through an
.Xr ioctl 2
interface.
There are commands to enable and disable the filter, load rulesets,
add and remove individual rules or state table entries,
and retrieve statistics.
The most commonly used functions are covered by
.Xr pfctl 8 .
.Pp
Manipulations like loading a ruleset that involve more than a single
ioctl call require a so-called ticket, which prevents the occurrence of
multiple concurrent manipulations.
.Pp
Fields of ioctl parameter structures that refer to packet data (like
addresses and ports) are generally expected in network byte-order.
.Pp
Anchor and ruleset manipulations can be supplied with empty strings for
these parameters, in which case modifications will manipulate the
.Dq main
packet filter ruleset.
.Sh IOCTL INTERFACE
.Nm
supports the following
.Xr ioctl 2
commands, available through
.Aq Pa net/pfvar.h :
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.It Dv DIOCSTART
Start the packet filter.
.It Dv DIOCSTOP
Stop the packet filter.

Add a passive OS fingerprint to the table.
Set
.Va fp_os.fp_os
to the packed fingerprint,
.Va fp_os.fp_class_nm
to the name of the class (Linux, Windows, etc),
.Va fp_os.fp_version_nm
to the name of the version (NT, 95, 98), and
.Va fp_os.fp_subtype_nm
to the name of the subtype or patchlevel.
The members
.Va fp_mss ,
.Va fp_wsize ,
.Va fp_psize ,
.Va fp_ttl ,
.Va fp_optcnt ,
and
.Va fp_wscale
are set to the TCP MSS, the TCP window size, the IP length, the IP TTL,
the number of TCP options, and the TCP window scaling constant of the
TCP SYN packet, respectively.
.Pp
The
.Va fp_flags
member is filled according to the
.Aq Pa net/pfvar.h
include file
.Dv PF_OSFP_*
defines.
The
.Va fp_tcpopts
member contains packed TCP options.
Each option uses
.Dv PF_OSFP_TCPOPT_BITS
bits in the packed value.
Options include any of
.Dv PF_OSFP_TCPOPT_NOP ,
.Dv PF_OSFP_TCPOPT_SACK ,
.Dv PF_OSFP_TCPOPT_WSCALE ,
.Dv PF_OSFP_TCPOPT_MSS ,
or
.Dv PF_OSFP_TCPOPT_TS .

The
.Va fp_getnum
member is not used with this ioctl.
.Pp
The structure's slack space must be zeroed for correct operation;
.Xr memset 3
the whole structure to zero before filling and sending to the kernel.
.It Dv DIOCOSFPGET Fa "struct pf_osfp_ioctl *io"
Get the passive OS fingerprint number
.Va fp_getnum
from the kernel's fingerprint list.
The rest of the structure members will come back filled.
Get the whole list by repeatedly incrementing the
.Va fp_getnum
number until the ioctl returns
.Er EBUSY .
.It Dv DIOCGETSRCNODES Fa "struct pfioc_src_nodes *psn"

#define psn_buf		psn_u.psu_buf
#define psn_src_nodes	psn_u.psu_src_nodes
};
.Ed
.Pp
Get the list of source nodes kept by sticky addresses and source
tracking.
The ioctl must be called once with
.Va psn_len
set to 0.
If the ioctl returns without error,
.Va psn_len
will be set to the size of the buffer required to hold all the
.Va pf_src_node
structures held in the table.
A buffer of this size should then be allocated, and a pointer to this buffer
placed in
.Va psn_buf .
The ioctl must then be called again to fill this buffer with the actual
source node data.
After that call,
.Va psn_len
will be set to the length of the buffer actually used.
.It Dv DIOCCLRSRCNODES
Clear the tree of source tracking nodes.
.It Dv DIOCIGETIFACES Fa "struct pfioc_iface *io"
Get the list of interfaces and interface drivers known to
.Nm .
All the ioctls that manipulate interfaces
use the same structure described below:
.Bd -literal
struct pfioc_iface {
	char			 pfiio_name[IFNAMSIZ];
	void			*pfiio_buffer;
	int			 pfiio_esize;
	int			 pfiio_size;
	int			 pfiio_nzero;
	int			 pfiio_flags;
};

#define PFI_FLAG_GROUP     0x0001  /* gets groups of interfaces */
#define PFI_FLAG_INSTANCE  0x0002  /* gets single interfaces */
#define PFI_FLAG_ALLMASK   0x0003
.Ed
.Pp
If not empty,
.Va pfiio_name
can be used to restrict the search to a specific interface or driver.
.Va pfiio_buffer[pfiio_size]
is the user-supplied buffer for returning the data.
On entry,
.Va pfiio_size
represents the number of
.Va pfi_if
entries that can fit into the buffer.
The kernel will replace this value by the real number of entries it wants
to return.
.Va pfiio_esize
should be set to
.Li sizeof(struct pfi_if) .
.Va pfiio_flags
should be set to
.Dv PFI_FLAG_GROUP ,
.Dv PFI_FLAG_INSTANCE ,
or both, to tell the kernel to return a group of interfaces
(drivers, like "fxp"), real interface instances (like "fxp1") or both.
The data is returned in the
.Va pfi_if
structure described below:
.Bd -literal
struct pfi_if {
	char				 pfif_name[IFNAMSIZ];
	u_int64_t			 pfif_packets[2][2][2];
	u_int64_t			 pfif_bytes[2][2][2];
	u_int64_t			 pfif_addcnt;
	u_int64_t			 pfif_delcnt;
	long				 pfif_tzero;
	int				 pfif_states;
	int				 pfif_rules;
	int				 pfif_flags;
};

#define PFI_IFLAG_GROUP		0x0001	/* group of interfaces */
#define PFI_IFLAG_INSTANCE	0x0002	/* single instance */
#define PFI_IFLAG_CLONABLE	0x0010	/* clonable group */
#define PFI_IFLAG_DYNAMIC	0x0020	/* dynamic group */
#define PFI_IFLAG_ATTACHED	0x0040	/* interface attached */
.Ed
.It Dv DIOCICLRISTATS Fa "struct pfioc_iface *io"
Clear the statistics counters of one or more interfaces.
.Va pfiio_name
and
.Va pfiio_flags
can be used to select which interfaces need to be cleared.
The filtering process is the same as for
.Dv DIOCIGETIFACES .
.Va pfiio_nzero
will be set by the kernel to the number of interfaces and drivers
that have been cleared.
