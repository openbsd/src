.Sh NAME
.Nm stge
.Nd Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "stge* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Pp
Configuration of PHYs or Ten-bit interfaces may also be necessary.
See
.Xr mii 4 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet
chip.
.Pp
The Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 is found on the D-Link DGE-550T, and
the Antares Microsystems Gigabit Ethernet board.
It uses an external PHY or an external 10-bit interface.
.\".Pp
.\"The TC9021 supports IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming in hardware.  The
.\".Nm
.\"driver supports this feature of the chip.  See
.\".Xr ifconfig 8
.\"for information on how to enable this feature.
.\" .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\" XXX too be done.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Jason R. Thorpe Aq thorpej@netbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not support the VLAN tag insertion/removal feature of the
TC9021 chip.
This is primarily because the TC9021's VLAN do not have a useful
programming interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver does not yet support jumbo Ethernet frames.
