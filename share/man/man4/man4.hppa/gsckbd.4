.Sh NAME
.Nm gsckbd
.Nd PS/2-like keyboard driver for wscons
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gsckbd* at gsckbc?"
.Cd "wskbd* at gsckbd? console ?"
.Cd "option GSCKBD_LAYOUT=XXX"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver supports the HP-specific PS/2-like keyboards within the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It doesn't provide direct device driver entry points but makes its
functions available via the internal
.Xr wskbd 4
interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports a number of different key mappings which
can be chosen from with the kernel option
.Dq GSCKBD_LAYOUT
at compile time or with the utility
.Xr wsconsctl 8
(variable:
.Dq keyboard.encoding
) at runtime.
Other mappings can be used if the whole keymap is replaced by means of
.Xr wsconsctl 8 .
The built-in mappings are at this time:
.Bl -hang
.It KB_UK
(
.Dq uk
) British.
.It KB_US
(
.Dq us
) English / US keyboard mapping (default).
.El
.Pp
The KB_US mapping can be modified
to swap the left Control and the Caps Lock keys by the
KB_SWAPCTRLCAPS variant bit or the
.Dq .swapctrlcaps
suffix.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set a british keyboard layout, use
.Ic wsconsctl -w keyboard.encoding=uk .
To set it at kernel build time, add
.Em option GSCKBD_LAYOUT="KB_UK"
to the kernel configuration file.
