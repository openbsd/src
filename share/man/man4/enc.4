.Sh NAME
.Nm enc
.Nd Encapsulating Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device enc" Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is a software loopback mechanism that allows hosts or
firewalls to filter
.Xr ipsec 4
traffic using
.Xr pf 4 .
The
.Xr vpn 8
manpage shows an example of such a setup.
.Pp
The
.Nm
interface is a software loopback mechanism that allows an administrator
to see outgoing packets before they have been processed by
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
or incoming packets after they have been similarly processed, via
.Xr tcpdump 8 .
.Pp
The
.Dq enc0
interface inherits all IPsec traffic.
Thus all IPsec traffic can be filtered based on
.Dq enc0 ,
and all IPsec traffic could be seen by invoking
.Xr tcpdump 8
on the
.Dq enc0
interface.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To see all outgoing packets before they have been processed via
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
or all incoming packets after they have been similarly processed:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig enc0 up
# tcpdump -i enc0
