.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ox
provides machine-independent bus support and drivers for Universal Serial Bus
.Pq Tn USB
devices.
.Pp
The
.Ox
.Nm
driver has three layers (like
.Xr scsi 4
and
.Xr pcmcia 4 ) :
the controller, the bus, and the device layer.
The controller attaches to a physical bus (like
.Xr pci 4 ) .
The
.Tn USB
bus attaches to the controller and the root hub attaches
to the controller.
Further devices, which may include further hubs,
attach to other hubs.
The attachment forms the same tree structure as the physical
.Tn USB
device tree.
For each
.Tn USB
device there may be additional drivers attached to it.
.Pp
The
.Cm uhub
device controls
.Tn USB
hubs and must always be present since there is at least one root hub in any
.Tn USB
system.
.Pp
The
.Cm flags
are used to specify if the devices on the
.Tn USB
bus should be probed
early in the boot process.
If the
.Cm flags
are specified with a value of 1, the
.Tn USB
bus will be probed when the
.Tn USB
host device is attached instead of waiting
until kernel processes start running.
This is useful for
.Tn USB
console keyboards so that the keyboard is attached
before getting the root prompt on
.Dq boot -a .

.Sh INTRODUCTION TO USB
The
.Tn USB
is a 12 Mb/s serial bus (1.5 Mb/s for low speed devices).
Each
.Tn USB
has a host controller that is the master of the bus;
all other devices on the bus only speak when spoken to.
.Pp
There can be up to 127 devices (apart from the host controller)
on a bus, each with its own address.
The addresses are assigned
dynamically by the host when each device is attached to the bus.
.Pp
Within each device there can be up to 16 endpoints.
Each endpoint
is individually addressed and the addresses are static.
Each of these endpoints will communicate in one of four different modes:
control, isochronous, bulk, or interrupt.
A device always has at least one endpoint.
This is a control endpoint at address 0
and is used to give commands to the device and extract basic data,
such as descriptors, from the device.
Each endpoint, except the control endpoint, is unidirectional.
.Pp
The endpoints in a device are grouped into interfaces.
An interface is a logical unit within a device; e.g.,
a compound device with both a keyboard and a trackball would present
one interface for each.
An interface can sometimes be set into different modes,
called alternate settings, which affects how it operates.
Different alternate settings can have different endpoints
within it.
.Pp
A device may operate in different configurations.
Depending on the
configuration the device may present different sets of endpoints
and interfaces.
.Pp
Each device located on a hub has several
.Xr config 8
locators:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width configuration -compact
.It Cd port
Number of the port on closest upstream hub.
.It Cd configuration
Configuration the device must be in for this driver to attach.
This locator does not set the configuration; it is iterated by the bus
enumeration.
.It Cd interface
Interface number within a device that an interface driver attaches to.
.It Cd vendor
16-bit vendor ID of the device.
.It Cd product
16-bit product ID of the device.
.It Cd release
16-bit release (revision) number of the device.
.El
.Pp
The first locator can be used to pin down a particular device
according to its physical position in the device tree.
The last three locators can be used to pin down a particular
device according to what device it actually is.
.Pp
The bus enumeration of the
.Tn USB
bus proceeds in several steps:
.Bl -enum
.It
Any device-specific driver can attach to the device.
.It
If none is found, any device class specific driver can attach.
.It
If none is found, all configurations are iterated over.
For each configuration all the interfaces are iterated over and interface
drivers can attach.
If any interface driver attached in a certain
configuration, the iteration over configurations is stopped.
.It
If still no drivers have been found, the generic
.Tn USB
driver can attach.
.El
.Sh USB CONTROLLER INTERFACE
Use the following to get access to the
.Tn USB
specific structures and defines.
.Fd #include <dev/usb/usb.h>
.Pp
The
.Pa /dev/usbN
device can be opened and a few operations can be performed on it.
The
.Xr poll 2
system call will say that I/O is possible on the controller device when a
.Tn USB
device has been connected or disconnected to the bus.
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
commands are supported on the controller device:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.\" .It Dv USB_DISCOVER
.\" This command will cause a complete bus discovery to be initiated.
.\" If any devices attached or detached from the bus they will be
.\" processed during this command.
.\" This is the only way that new devices are found on the bus.
.It Dv USB_DEVICEINFO Fa "struct usb_device_info"
This command can be used to retrieve some information about a device
on the bus.
The
.Va addr
field should be filled before the call and the other fields will
be filled by information about the device on that address.
Should no such device exist an error is reported.
.Bd -literal
struct usb_device_info {
	uByte	addr;		/* device address */
	char	product[USB_MAX_STRING_LEN];
	char	vendor[USB_MAX_STRING_LEN];
	char	release[8];
	uByte	class;
	uByte	config;
	uByte	lowspeed;
	int	power;
	int	nports;
	uByte	ports[16];
#define USB_PORT_ENABLED 0xff
#define USB_PORT_SUSPENDED 0xfe
#define USB_PORT_POWERED 0xfd
#define USB_PORT_DISABLED 0xfc
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va product ,
.Va vendor ,
and
.Va release
fields contain self-explanatory descriptions of the device.
.Pp
The
.Va class
field contains the device class.
.Pp
The
.Va config
field shows the current configuration of the device.
.Pp
The
.Va lowspeed
field
is set if the device is a
.Tn USB
low speed device.
.Pp
The
.Va power
field shows the power consumption in milli-amps drawn at 5 volts,
or zero if the device is self powered.
.Pp
If the device is a hub the
.Va nports
field is non-zero and the
.Va ports
field contains the addresses of the connected devices.
If no device is connected to a port one of the
.Va USB_PORT_*
values indicates its status.
.It Dv USB_DEVICESTATS Fa "struct usb_device_stats"
This command retrieves statistics about the controller.
.Bd -literal
struct usb_device_stats {
	u_long	requests[4];
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va requests
field is indexed by the transfer kind, i.e.
.Va UE_* ,
and indicates how many transfers of each kind that has been completed
by the controller.
.It Dv USB_REQUEST Fa "struct usb_ctl_request"
This command can be used to execute arbitrary requests on the control pipe.
This is
.Em DANGEROUS
and should be used with great care since it
can destroy the bus integrity.
.El
.Pp
The include file
.Aq Pa dev/usb/usb.h
contains definitions for the types used by the various
.Xr ioctl 2
calls.
The naming convention of the fields for the various
.Tn USB
descriptors exactly follows the naming in the
.Tn USB
specification.
Byte sized fields can be accessed directly, but word (16-bit)
sized fields must be accessed by the
.Fn UGETW field
and
.Fn USETW field value
macros to handle byte order and alignment properly.
.Pp
The include file
.Aq Pa dev/usb/usbhid.h
similarly contains the definitions for
Human Interface Devices
.Pq Tn HID .
