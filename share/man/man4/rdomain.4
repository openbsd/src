.Dt RDOMAIN 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rtable ,
.Nm rdomain
.Nd routing tables and routing domains
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The traditional kernel routing system had a single table for routes and
allowed for non-conflicting IP address assignments.
.Em rtable
and
.Em rdomain
allows us to have seperate lookup tables for routes,
and assign IP addresses independantly from other interfaces.
.Pp
.Sh rtable
.Em rtable
allows one to set a different route table for outbound network packets.
As with the traditional routing system, IP addresses cannot overlap.
You can have multiple
.Em rtable
within the same routing domain.
Commonly used to set Policy Based Routing.
.Sh rdomain
.Em rdomain
are completely seperate seperate routing domains and tables in the kernel.
An IP address (e.g. 10.0.0.1/16) can be assigned in multple
.Em rdomains ,
but
cannot be assigned more than once per
.Em rdomain .
An interface belongs to one and only one
.Em rdomain .
The interface's
.Em rdomain
determines which rdomain an incoming packet will
be in.
Virtual interfaces do not need to belong to the same
.Em rdomain
as the parent.
An
.Em rdomain
contains at least one routing table.

.\" ifconfig em0 192.0.2.100/24
.\" route -T4 -n add default 192.0.2.1

.Sh HISTORY
.Ox
support for

.\" .Nm
rdomains
first appeared in
.Ox 4.9
and IPv6 support first appeared in
.Ox 5.5 .
