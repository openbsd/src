.Dt RDOMAIN 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rtable ,
.Nm rdomain
.Nd routing tables and routing domains
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The traditional kernel routing system had a single table for routes and
allowed only non-conflicting IP address assignments.
The
.Nm rtable
feature allows multiple lookup tables for routes.
The
.Nm rdomain
feature makes it possible to assign the same IP address to more than one
interface.
.Ss Routing tables
Each
.Nm rtable
contains routes for outbound network packets.
A routing domain can contain more than one
.Nm rtable .
Within a domain, IP addresses used for different interfaces cannot overlap.
Multiple routing tables are commonly used for Policy Based Routing.
.Ss Routing domains
Each
.Nm rdomain
is a completely separate address space in the kernel.
An IP address (e.g. 10.0.0.1/16) can be assigned in more than one
.Nm rdomain ,
but
cannot be assigned more than once per
.Nm rdomain .
An interface belongs to one and only one
.Nm rdomain .
The interface's
.Nm rdomain
determines which rdomain an incoming packet will
be in.
Virtual interfaces do not need to belong to the same
.Nm rdomain
as the parent.
Each
.Nm rdomain
contains at least one routing table.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Set up em0 and lo4 onto rdomain 4:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig em0 rdomain 4
# ifconfig lo4 rdomain 4
# ifconfig lo4 inet 127.0.0.1/8
# ifconfig em0 192.0.2.100/24
.Ed
.Pp
Set a default route and localhost reject route within rdomain 4:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# route -T4 -qn add -net 127 127.0.0.1 -reject
# route -T4 -n add default 192.0.2.1
.Ed
.Pp
Start an sshd in rdomain 4:
.Pp
.Dl # route -T4 exec /usr/sbin/sshd
.Pp
pf.conf snippet to block incoming port 80, and nat-to and move to rtable 0
on interface em1:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
block in on rdomain 4 proto tcp to any port 80
match out on rdomain 4 to !$internal_net nat-to (em1) rtable 0

.Sh HISTORY
.Ox
support for
.\" XXX - rdomains, not 'rtable'
.\" .Nm
rdomains
first appeared in
.Ox 4.9
and IPv6 support first appeared in
.Ox 5.5 .
