.Sh NAME
.Nm vxlan
.Nd Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network tunnel interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device vxlan"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
pseudo-device provides interfaces for tunnelling or overlaying
Ethernet networks on top of IPv4 and IPv6 networks using the
Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) protocol.
.Pp
VXLAN datagrams consist of an Ethernet payload encapsulated by an
8 byte VXLAN header, which in turn is encapsulated by UDP and IP
headers.
Different VXLAN tunnels or overlays between the same VXLAN Tunnel
Endpoints (VTEPs) can be distinguished by an optional 24-bit Virtual
Network Idenfitier (VNI).
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface can be created using the
.Ic ifconfig vxlan Ns Ar N Ic create
command or by setting up a
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration file for
.Xr netstart 8 .
.Pp
For correct operation, encapsulated traffic must not be routed
over the interface itself.
This can be implemented by adding a distinct or a more specific
route to the tunnel destination than the hosts or networks routed
via the tunnel interface.
Alternatively, the tunnel traffic may be configured in a separate
routing table to the encapsulated traffic.
.Pp
The interface can operate in the following tunnel modes:
.Bl -tag -width multicast
.It Ic point-to-point mode
When a unicast IP address is configured as the tunnel destination,
all traffic is sent to a single tunnel endpoint.
.It Ic learning mode
When a multicast IP address is configured as the tunnel destination,
.Nm
operates as a learning bridge.
Broadcast, multicast, and unknown unicast packets are sent to the
specified multicast group.
Packets received by the tunnel source address are used to dynamically
learn the endpoint addresses for the encapsulated Ethernet source
addresses.
.It Ic endpoint mode
When configured without a tunnel destination address,
.Nm
operates as a bridge, but with learning disabled.
Endpoints for Ethernet addresses must be added explicitly before
packets will be sent for those addresses.
All valid VXLAN packets sent to the local address will be accepted.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a point-to-point tunnel using Virtual Network Identifier 5:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig vxlan0 tunnel 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200 vnetid 5
# ifconfig vxlan0 10.1.1.100/24
.Ed
.Pp
The following examples creates a learning overlay network:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig vxlan0 tunnel 192.168.1.100 239.1.1.100 vnetid 7395
# ifconfig vxlan0 10.1.2.100/24
.Ed
.Pp
Prior to the assignment of UDP port 4789 by IANA, some early VXLAN
implementations used port 8472.
A non-standard port can be specified with the tunnel destination
address:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig vxlan0 tunnel 192.168.1.100 239.1.1.100:8472
.Ed
.Sh SECURITY
.Nm
does not provide any integrated security features.
It is designed to be a simple protocol that can be used in trusted
data center environments, to carry VM traffic between virtual machine
hypervisors, and provide virtualized layer 2 networks in Cloud
infrastructures.
.Pp
To protect
.Nm
tunnels, the traffic can be protected with IPsec to add authentication
and encryption for confidentiality.
.Pp
The Packet Filter (PF) can be used to filter tunnel traffic with
endpoint policies in
.Xr pf.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
table <vxlantep> { 192.168.1.200, 192.168.1.201 }
block in on em0
pass out on em0
pass in on em0 proto udp from <vxlantep> to port vxlan
.Ed
.Pp
The Time-to-Live (TTL) value of the tunnel can be set to 1 or a low
value to restrict the traffic to the local network:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig vxlan0 tunnelttl 1

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Ox 5.5 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
interface requires at least 50 bytes for the IP, UDP and VXLAN
protocol overhead and optionally 4 bytes for the encapsulated VLAN tag.
The default MTU is set to 1500 bytes but can be adjusted if the
transport interfaces carrying the tunnel traffic do not support larger
MTUs, the tunnel traffic is leaving the local network, or if
interoperability with another implementation requires running a
decreased MTU of 1450 bytes.
In any other case, it is commonly recommended to set the MTU of the
transport interfaces to at least 1600 bytes.
