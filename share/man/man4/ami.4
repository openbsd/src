Some cards support both I2O and so called `Mass Storage' mode
of operation.
This driver only supports the `Mass Storage' mode, I2O mode is supported
by the

Although the controllers are actual RAID controllers the driver makes them
look just like SCSI controllers.
All RAID configuration is done through the controllers' BIOSes.
