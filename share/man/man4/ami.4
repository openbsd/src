.Cd "ami* at pci? dev ? function ?"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for MegaRAID family of RAID controllers.
.Pp
These controllers support RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, JBOD
and superpositions of those configurations.
.Pp
Some cards support both I2O and so called `Mass Storage' mode
of operation.
This driver only supports the `Mass Storage' mode, I2O mode is supported
by the
.Xr iop 4
driver.
.Pp
Although the controllers are actual RAID controllers the driver makes them
look just like SCSI controllers.
All RAID configuration is done through the controllers' BIOSes.
