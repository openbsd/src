.Pp
These controllers support RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, JBOD,
and superpositions of those configurations.
.Pp
Some cards support both I2O and a so-called
.Sq Mass Storage
mode of operation.
This driver only supports the
.Sq Mass Storage
mode; I2O mode is supported
by the
.Xr iop 4
driver.
However it is recommended to use these cards in
.Sq Mass Storage
mode.
.Pp
Although the controllers are actual RAID controllers,
the driver makes them look just like SCSI controllers.
All RAID configuration is done through the controllers' BIOSes.
.Pp
The management interface is provided through the
.Xr bio 4
device or one of the daughter
.Xr sd 4
devices as implemented in the
.Xr bioctl 8
utility.
