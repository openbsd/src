.Sh NAME
.Nm wsmouse
.Nd generic mouse support in wscons
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wsmouse* at ..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver is an abstraction layer for mice within the
.Xr wscons 4
framework.
It is attached to the hardware specific mouse drivers and
provides a character device interface which returns
.Fa struct wscons_event
via
.Xr read 2 .
For use with X servers,
.Dq mouse events
can be generated.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a number of ioctl functions to control various parameters (see
.Pa /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsconsio.h ) .
The
.Xr wsconsctl 8
utility gives access to these variables.
