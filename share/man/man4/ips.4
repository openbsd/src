.Sh NAME
.Nm ips
.Nd IBM SATA/SCSI ServeRAID controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Cd "scsibus* at ips?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for IBM ServeRAID controllers, including:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It
ServeRAID 3H/3HB/3L
.It
ServeRAID 4H/4L/4Lx/4M/4Mx
.It
ServeRAID 5i/5i II
.It
ServeRAID 6i/6M

.Pp
Although the controllers are actual RAID controllers,
the driver makes them look just like SCSI controllers.
All RAID configuration is done through the bootable
IBM ServeRAID Support CD;
a CD image is freely available at the IBM website.
.Pp
The management interface is provided through the
.Xr bio 4
device or one of the daughter
.Xr sd 4
devices as implemented in the
.Xr bioctl 8
utility.
Logical disk status is exposed under the
.Va hw.sensors
.Xr sysctl 8
and can be monitored using
.Xr sensorsd 8 .

.An -nosplit
The

driver was written by
.An Alexander Yurchenko Aq grange@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
Due to
.Xr bioctl 8
limitations the
.Nm
driver associates all unused and hot spare drives with the first volume
but the drives can be used for rebuilding any degraded volume.
