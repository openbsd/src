.Sh NAME
.Nm ipsec
.Nd IP Security Protocol
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <net/encap.h>
.Fd #include <netinet/ip_ipsp.h>
.Fd #include <netinet/ip_esp.h>
.Fd #include <netinet/ip_ah.h>
.Ft int
.Fn socket AF_ENCAP SOCK_RAW AF_UNSPEC
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn IPSec is a pair of protocols, 
.Nm ESP 
(for Encapsulting Security
Payload) and 
.Nm AH 
(for Authentication Header), which provide
security services for IP datagrams. Specifically, 
.Nm ESP 
provides
confidentiality, connectionless
integrity, anti-replay service and limited traffic flow
confidentiality. It optionally provides data origin authentication.
.Nm AH 
provides connectionless integrity, data
origin authentication and anti-replay service.
.Pp
This is done by inserting the appropriate header 
.Nm ( ESP 
or 
.Nm AH )
between the IP header and the payload. The inserted header,
along with the IP header destination address, provide enough
information to find the relevant state in the kernel (security
association) and handle the packet appropriately (decrypt, 
authenticate etc.)
.Pp
An SA (Security Association) is uniquely defined by the
.Nm SPI
(Security Parameter Index), which is a 32-bit integer, 
the remote IP address and the security protocol.
.Pp
The payload can be any of the usual IP protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP
etc.) or IP itself, for those situations where IP tunneling is
required.
.Pp
This implementation makes use of a virtual interface 
.Nm enc0 ,
which can be used in packet filters to specify those
packets that have been successfully processed by IPSec.
.Pp
Security Associations can be set up manually with
the
.Xr ipsecadm 1
utility or the
.Xr photurisd 8
key management daemon.
.Pp
The following
.Tn IP-level
.Xr setsockopt 2 / Ns
.Xr getsockopt 2
are specific to
.Xr ipsec 4 .
A socket can specifiy security levels for three different categories:
.Bl -tag -width IP_ESP_NETWORK_LEVEL
.It IP_AUTH_LEVEL
Specifies the use of authentication for packets sent or received by the
socket.
.It IP_ESP_TRANS_LEVEL
Specifies the use of encryption in transport mode for packets sent or
received by the socket.
.It IP_ESP_NETWORK_LEVEL
Specifies the use of encryption in tunnel mode.
.El
.Pp
For each of the categories there are five possible levels which specify the
security policy used for each category:
.Bl -tag -width IPSEC_LEVEL_REQUIRE
.It IPSEC_LEVEL_BYPASS
Bypass the default system security policy, this options can only be used
by privileged processes. This level is necessary for key management daemons
like
.Xr photurisd 8 .
.It IPSEC_LEVEL_AVAIL
If a Security Association is available it will be used for sending packets
by that socket.
.It IPSEC_LEVEL_USE
Use IP Security for sending packets but still accept packets which are not
secured.
.It IPSEC_LEVEL_REQUIRE
Use IP Security for sending packets and also require IP Security for receiving
data.
.It IPSEC_LEVEL_UNIQUE
The outbound Security Association will only be used by this socket.
.El
.Pp 
When a socket gets created it is assigned the default system security level
for each category which can be queried with
.Xr getsockopt 2 . 
Only a privileged process can lower the security level with a
.Xr setsockopt 2 
call.
.Pp
For example, a server process might want to accept only authenticated 
connections to prevent session hijacking. It would issue the following
.Xr setsockopt 2 
call:
.Bd -literal
int level = IPSEC_LEVEL_REQUIRE;
error = setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_AUTH_LEVEL, (u_char *)&level, 
		   sizeof(int));
.Ed
.Pp
The system can not guarantee that it will be able to establish the
required security associations, in any case a properly configured
key management daemon is required which listens to 
.Dv EMT_NOTIFY 
messages on a 
.Dv PF_ENCAP
socket.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:
.Bl -tag -width [EINVAL]
.It Bq Er EACESS
when an attempt is made to lower the security level below the system default
by a non-privileged process.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The length of option field did not match or an unknown security level
was given.
.El
.Sh BUGS
There's a lot more to be said on this subject. This is just a beginning.
.Br
At the moment the socket options are not fully implemented.

.Sh ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The authors of this code are John Ioannidis, Angelos D.
Keromytis and Niels Provos.
.Pp
Eric Young's libdeslite was used in this implementation for the
DES algorithm.
.Pp
Steve Reid's SHA-1 code was also used.
.Pp
The 
.Xr setsockopt 2 / Ns
.Xr getsockotp 2 
interface follows somewhat loosely the draft-mcdonald-simple-ipsec-api,
which is work in progress.
.Sh HISTORY
The IPsec protocol started in 1992, by John Ioannidis, Phil Karn 
and William Allen Simpson. In 1995, the former wrote an
implementation for BSD/OS. Angelos D. Keromytis ported it to
OpenBSD and NetBSD. The latest transforms and new features were
implemented by Angelos D. Keromytis and Niels Provos.
