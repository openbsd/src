.Sh NAME
.Nm ioprbs
.Nd I2O random block storage
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ioprbs* at iop? tid ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at ioprbs?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for I2O random block storages, like RAID-sets.
So far only the following adapters has been tested:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.Tn Adaptec 2100S ,
.Tn Adaptec 3200S .
.El
.Pp
Although only those two adapters have been tested, the I2O interface is
a generic one, and the driver should cope with all I2O random block
storages with no further adaptions.
.Pp
The storage is presented to the system as SCSI disks for uniformity
with other RAID controllers we support.  All RAID configuration is done
through the controllers' BIOSes.

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm

inspired by the NetBSD ld_iop driver by
.An Andrew Doran Aq ad@netbsd.org .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
There currently is a boundary bug which sometime makes it impossible to
fully use the last cylinder.  If you see diagnostics when building your
filesystem, just shrink that partition a little.
.Pp
It is not yet possible to boot of an
.Nm
device.
