.Sh NAME
.Nm gre
.Nd encapsulating network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device gre Op Ar count
.Sh NOTE
.Tn GRE
and
.Tn MobileIP
is enabled with the following
.Xr sysctl 3
variables in
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf :
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It net.inet.gre.allow
Allow GRE packets in and out of the system.
.It net.inet.mobileip.allow
Allow MobileIP packets in and out of the system.
.El
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm gre
network interface is a pseudo device that allows to encapsulate datagrams
into IP. These encapsulated datagrams are routed to a destination host,
where they are decapsulated and further routed to their final destination.
The so called ``tunnel'' appears to the inner datagrams like one hop.
.Pp
This driver currently supports the following modes of operation:
.Bl -tag -width abc
.It GRE encapsulation (IP protocol number 47). 
Encapsulated datagrams are
prepended by a outer datagram and a GRE header. The GRE header specifies
the type of the encapsulated datagram and thus allows for tunneling other
protocols than IP like e.g. AppleTalk (not yet supported). GRE mode is
also the default tunnel mode on Cisco routers. This is also the default
mode of operation of the 
.Sy gre Ns Ar X
interfaces.
.It MOBILE encapsulation (IP protocol number 55). 
Datagrams are 
encapsulated into IP, but with a shorter encapsulation. The original
IP header is modified and the modifications are inserted between the
so modified header and the original payload. Like IPIP only for IP in IP
encapsulation.
.El
.Pp
The network interfaces are named
.Sy gre Ns Ar 0 ,
.Sy gre Ns Ar 1 
and so on, as many as have given on the 
.Sy pseudo-device
line in the system config file. Each interface supports a number of
.Xr ioctl 2 Ns s,
such as:
.Bl -tag -width aaa
.It GRESADDRS: 
Set the IP address of the local tunnel end.
.It GRESADDRD: 
Set the IP address of the remote tunnel end.
.It GREGADDRS: 
Query the IP address that is set for the local tunnel end.
.It GREGADDRD: 
Query the IP address that is set for the remote tunnel end.
.It GRESPROTO: 
Set the operation mode to the specified IP protocol value. The
protocol is passed to the interface in (struct ifreq)->ifr_flags.
The operation mode can also
be given as 
.Bl -tag -width bbb
.It link0
IPPROTO_GRE
.It link2
IPPROTO_MOBILE
.El
.Pp
to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
As the linkN flags are not mutually exclusive, modes must be set by applying
positive and negative flags as e.g. 
.Xr ifconfig 8
link0 -link1 -link2
.It GREGPROTO: 
Query operation mode.
.El
.Pp
Note that the IP addresses of the tunnel endpoints may be the same as the
ones defined with 
.Xr ifconfig 8
for the interface (as if IP is encapsulated), but need not be, as e.g. when 
encapsulating AppleTalk.
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLE
Configuration example:
.Bd -literal


Host X-- Host A  ----------------tunnel---------- cisco D------Host E
          \\                                          |
           \\                                        /
             +------Host B----------Host C----------+

.Ed
   On host A (NetBSD):

   # route add default B
   # ifconfig greN  A D netmask 0xffffffff linkX up
   # greconfig -i greN -s A -d D
   # route add E D

   On Host D (Cisco):

   Interface TunnelX 	
    ip unnumbered D   ! e.g. address from Ethernet interface
    tunnel source D   ! e.g. address from Ethernet interface
    tunnel destination A
   ip route C <some interface and mask>
   ip route A mask C
   ip route X mask tunnelX

   OR

   On Host D (NetBSD):

   # route add default C
   # ifconfig greN D A 
.Pp
If all goes well, you should see packets flowing ;-)
.Pp
If you want to reach Host A over the tunnel (from the Cisco D), then 
you have to have an alias on Host A for e.g. the Ethernet interface like:
     ifconfig <etherif> alias Y
 and on the cisco
     ip route Y mask tunnelX
.Sh NOTE
For correct operation, the
.Nm
device needs a route to the destination, that is less specific than the
one over the tunnel.
(Basically, there needs to be a route to the decapsulating host that
does not run over the tunnel, as this would be a loop ..)
.Pp
In order to 
.Xr ifconfig 8
to actually mark the interface as up, the keyword ``up'' must be given
last on its command line.
.Pp
The kernel must be set to forward datagrams by either option
``GATEWAY'' in the kernel config file or by issuing the appropriate 
option to
.Xr sysctl 8 .

A description of MOBILE encapsulation can be found in RFC 2004.
.Sh BUGS
The compute_route() code in if_gre.c toggles the last bit of the
IP-address to provoke the search for a less specific route than the
one directly over the tunnel to prevent loops. This is possibly not
the best solution.
.Pp
To avoid the address munging described above, turn on the link1 flag
on the ifconfig command line.  This implies that the GRE packet
destination (set via greconfig -d) and the ifconfig remote host are
not the same IP addresses, and that the GRE destination does not route
over the greX interface itself.
.Pp
GRE RFC not yet fully implemented (no GRE options), no other protocols
yet than IP over IP.
