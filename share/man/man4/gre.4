.Sh NAME
.Nm gre ,
.Nm egre
.Nd Generic Routing Encapsulation network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device gre"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm gre
pseudo-device provides interfaces for tunnelling protocols across
IPv4 and IPv6 networks using the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
encapsulation protocol.
.Pp
GRE datagrams (IP protocol number 47) consist of a GRE header
and an outer IP header for encapsulating another protocol's datagram.
The GRE header specifies the type of the encapsulated datagram,
allowing for the tunnelling of multiple protocols.
Different tunnels between the same endpoints may be distinguised
by an optional Key field in the GRE header.
.Pp
This pseudo driver provides the clonable network interfaces:
.Bl -tag -width nvgreXXX
.It Nm gre
Layer 3 protocols, specifically IPv4, IPv6, and MPLS, are encapsulated
by GRE and IP headers.
The MTU is set to 1476 by default to match the value used by Cisco routers.
.Nm gre
also supports reception of WCCP encapsulated IPv4 packets.
.It Nm egre
Layer 2 Ethernet packets are encapsulated by GRE and IP headers.
Transparent Ethernet (0x6558) is used as the protocol identifier
in the GRE header as per RFC 1701.
The MTU is set to 1500 by default.
.El
.Pp
GRE and WCCP are enabled with the following
.Xr sysctl 2
variables respectively in
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf :
.Bl -tag -width "net.inet.wccp.allow"
.It Va net.inet.gre.allow
Allow GRE packets in and out of the system.
.It Va net.inet.gre.wccp
Set to 1 to allow WCCPv1-style GRE packets into the system;
set to 2 to handle the packets as WCCPv2-style GRE, truncating
the redirect header.
Some magic with the packet filter configuration
and a caching proxy like squid are needed
to do anything useful with these packets.
This sysctl requires
.Va gre.allow
to be set.
.El
.Pp
.Nm gre
and
.Nm egre
interfaces can be created at runtime using the
.Ic ifconfig iface Ns Ar N Ic create
command or by setting up a
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration file for
.Xr netstart 8 .
.Pp
The default MTU may not be an optimal value depending on the link
between the tunnel endpoints, but can be adjusted.
.Pp
For correct operation, the route to the tunnel destination must not
go over the interface itself.
This can be implemented by adding a distinct or a more specific
route to the tunnel destination than the hosts or networks routed
via the tunnel interface.
Alternatively, the tunnel traffic may be configured in a separate
routing table to the encapsulated traffic.
.Pp
Each interface supports use of the optional GRE Key field as a
virtual network idenfitier.
.Pp
.Nm gre
optionally supports sending keepalive packets to the remote endpoint,
which allows tunnel failure to be detected.
.Nm gre
interfaces can be individually configured to receive WCCP packets by
setting the link-level flag
.Cm link0 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm gre
Configuration example:
.Bd -literal
Host X ---- Host A ------------ tunnel ------------ Cisco D ---- Host E
               \e                                      /
                \e                                    /
                 +------ Host B ------ Host C ------+
.Ed
.Pp
On Host A
.Pq Ox :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# route add default B
# ifconfig greN create
# ifconfig greN A D netmask 0xffffffff up
# ifconfig greN tunnel A D
# route add E D
.Ed
.Pp
On Host D (Cisco):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Interface TunnelX
 ip unnumbered D   ! e.g. address from Ethernet interface
 tunnel source D   ! e.g. address from Ethernet interface
 tunnel destination A
ip route C <some interface and mask>
ip route A mask C
ip route X mask tunnelX
.Ed
.Pp
OR
.Pp
On Host D
.Pq Ox :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# route add default C
# ifconfig greN create
# ifconfig greN D A
# ifconfig greN tunnel D A
.Ed
.Pp
To reach Host A over the tunnel (from Host D), there has to be an
alias on Host A for the Ethernet interface:
.Pp
.Dl # ifconfig <etherif> alias Y
.Pp
and on the Cisco:
.Pp
.Dl ip route Y mask tunnelX
.Pp
Keepalive packets may be enabled like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig greN keepalive period count
.Ed
.Pp
This will send a keepalive packet every
.Ar period
seconds.
If no response is received in
.Ar count
*
.Ar period
seconds, the link is considered down.
To return keepalives, the remote host must be configured to forward packets:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
.Ed
.Pp
If
.Xr pf 4
is enabled then it is necessary to add a pass rule specific for the keepalive
packets.
The rule must use
.Cm no state
because the keepalive packet is entering the network stack multiple times.
In most cases the following should work:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pass quick on gre proto gre no state

.Sh CAVEATS
RFC 1701 and RFC 2890 describe a variety of optional GRE header
fields in the protocol that are not implemented in the
.Nm gre
driver.
The only optional field the driver implements support for is the
Key header.
.Pp
The redirect header for WCCPv2 GRE encapsulated packets is skipped.
