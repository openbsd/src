.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi
.Nd Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acpi0 at mainbus?"
.Pp
.Cd "option ACPIVERBOSE"
.Cd "option ACPI_ENABLE"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides basic support for ACPI including loading ACPI tables from
the firmware, parsing and interpreting AML code, event handling,
suspending and powering off, and attaching device drivers.
.Pp
If the configuration option
.Dq Dv ACPIVERBOSE
is set, information about all detected ACPI devices will be displayed
on boot.
.Pp
If the configuration option
.Dq Dv ACPI_ENABLE
is set, the
.Nm
driver will take control of ACPI from the firmware (BIOS).
WARNING: this may cause an overheating on some machines since
.Nm
doesn't provide any thermal or cooling control.
