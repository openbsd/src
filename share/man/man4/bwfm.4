.Sh NAME
.Nm bwfm
.Nd Broadcom and Cypress wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bwfm* at pci?"
.Cd "bwfm* at sdmmc?"
.Cd "bwfm* at usb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Broadcom and Cypress FullMAC network
adapters.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It Host AP
In this mode the driver acts as an access point (base station)
for other cards.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the current encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
The
.Nm
driver relies on the software 802.11 stack for the WPA handshake.
Both encryption and decryption of data frames are handled by the
firmware.
.Pp
The firmware automatically selects the transmit speed and the channel
depending on the received signal strength.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a firmware file which is loaded when the driver
attaches.
A prepackaged version of the firmware can be installed using
.Xr fw_update 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example scans for available networks:
.Pp
.Dl # ifconfig bwfm0 scan
.Pp
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures bwfm0 to join network
.Dq mynwid ,
using WPA key
.Dq mywpakey ,
obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nwid mynwid
wpakey mywpakey
dhcp
.Ed
.Pp
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example creates a host-based access point on boot:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mediaopt hostap
nwid mynwid
wpakey mywpakey
inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
