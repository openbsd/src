.Sh NAME
.Nm hifn
.Nd Hi/fn 7751 symmetric encryption accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hifn* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports various cards containing the Hi/fn 7751 chipset, such as
.Bl -tag -width namenamenamena -offset indent
.It Invertex AEON
No longer being made.  Came as 128KB SRAM model, or 2MB DRAM model.
.It Hi/fn 7751
Reference board with 512KB SRAM.
.It PowerCrypt
See
.Pa www.powercrypt.com.
Comes with 512KB SRAM.
.It NetSec 7751
See
.Pa www.netsec.net.
Supports the most IPSEC sessions, with 1MB SRAM.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver registers itself to accelerate DES, Triple-DES, MD5-HMAC96,
and SHA1-HMAC96 operations in
.Xr ipsec 4 .
.Sh BUGS
The 7751 chip starts out at initialization by only supporting compression.
A proprietary algorithm, which has been reverse engineered, is required to
unlock the cryptographic functionality of the chip.  It is possible for
vendors to make boards which have an lock ID not known to the driver, but
all vendors just use the obvious ID which is 13 bytes of 0.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 9 ,
.Xr crypt 3 ,
.Xr ipsec 4
.Sh CAVEATS
The Hi/fn 9751 shares the same PCI id.  This chip is basically a 7751, but
with the cryptographic functions missing.  Instead, the 9751 is only capable
of doing compression.  Since we do not currently attempt to use either of
these chips to do any compression, the 9751-based cards are not useful.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .
