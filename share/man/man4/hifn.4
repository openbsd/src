.Sh NAME
.Nm hifn
.Nd Hi/fn 7751 encryption accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hifn* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports various cards containing the Hi/fn 7751 chipset, including
boards sold by
.Pa www.powercrypt.com
and others.
The Invertex AEON card is also supported, though that company no longer
exists.
.Sh BUGS
The 7751 chip starts out at initialization by only supporting compression.
A proprietary algorithm, which has been reverse engineered, is required to
unlock the cryptographic functionality of the chip.  It is possible for
vendors to make boards which have an lock ID not known to the driver, but
all vendors just use the obvious ID which is 12 bytes of 0.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .
