.Sh NAME
.Nm radio
.Nd device-independent radio driver layer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/ioctl.h>
.Fd #include <sys/radioio.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various FM radio cards.
It provides an uniform programming interface layer above different underlying
radio hardware drivers.
.Pp
For radio tuner controlling there is a single device file available:
.Pa /dev/radio .
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
commands are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RIOCSMUTE (u_long)
This command mutes or unmutes the device.
This operation does not affect volume value of the device.
.It Dv RIOCGMUTE (u_long)
This command returns current mute state of the device.
.It Dv RIOCSMONO (u_long)
This command sets the device output to mono even if the device receive a stereo
signal (forced mono).
.It Dv RIOCGMONO (u_long)
This command returns current forced mono state of the device.
.It Dv RIOCGVOLU (u_long)
This command returns current volume of the device.
.It Dv RIOCSVOLU (u_long)
This command sets current volume of the device.
.It Dv RIOCGFREQ (u_long)
This command returns frequency the device is tuned to.
.It Dv RIOCSFREQ (u_long)
This command sets working frequency of the device.
.It Dv RIOCSSRCH (u_long)
This command assumes that a signal search is required and gives direction
of search to the driver - 0 to search down and any non-zero value to search up.
.It Dv RIOCGCAPS (u_long)
This command returns the device capabilities.
The capabilities can have following values:
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_DETECT_STEREO
The device can determine is it tuned to a stereo signal.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_DETECT_SIGNAL
The device can determine is it tuned or not.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_SET_MONO
The device capable to forcible set its output to mono.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_HW_SEARCH
The device can do hardware search.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_HW_AFC
The device has an internal hardware automatic frequency control.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_REFERENCE_FREQ
The device allow to change the reference frequency of a received signal.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_LOCK_SENSITIVITY
The device allow to change the station lock sensitivity used during search
operation.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_CARD_TYPE
Some cards have several different incarnations.
This allow to determine the variant of the card.
Currently not used.
.El
.It Dv RIOCGINFO (u_long)
This commands returns current state of the device.
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RADIO_INFO_SIGNAL
Informs whether the device receives a valid signal or noise.
.It Dv RADIO_INFO_STEREO
Informs whether the device receives a stereo or mono signal.
.El
.It Dv RIOCGREFF (u_long)
This command returns current value of the device's reference frequency.
.It Dv RIOCSREFF (u_long)
This command sets reference frequency of the device.
.It Dv RIOCGLOCK (u_long)
This command returns current value of the device's station lock sensitivity.
.It Dv RIOCSLOCK (u_long)
This command sets station lock sensitivity of the device.

.Sh BUGS
You can have only one card of the same type.
For example, if you have two aztech FM tuners, the first card with jumper
set to port 0x358 and the second one - to 0x350, you can use only one
aztech card (in the kernel, that is) either with port 0x350 or 0x358.
Don't even try to compile support for the second card into the kernel.
