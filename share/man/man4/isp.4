.Sh NAME
.Nm isp
.Nd Qlogic based SCSI or FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isp* at pci? dev? function?" Pq PCI
.Cd "isp* at sbus? slot ? offset ?" Pq SBus
.Cd scsibus* at isp?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to a
.Tn SCSI
bus or a
.Tn FibreChannel
connected to
.Tn Qlogic
ISP1000 (SBus), ISP1020 (PCI), ISP1040(PCI),
.Tn SCSI
host adapters or ISP2100(PCI)
.Tn FibreChannel
host adapters.
.Pp
Features include support for UltraSCSI and wide mode transactions for
.Tn SCSI ,
and the FCP SCSI profile for
.Tn FibreChannel .
Command tagging is supported for all (in fact,
.Tn FibreChannel
requires tagging).
.Sh CONFIGURATION
An optional
.Tn flags 0x80
appended to the above
.Tn isp*
declarations will disable the download of driver f/w, which means you
use whatever F/W is running on the card.
.Sh BUGS
The driver currently ignores NVRAM settings (PCI cards only), which establish
per-target parameters.
.Pp
The driver currently doesn't do error recovery for timed out commands
very gracefully.
