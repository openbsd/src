.Sh NAME
.Nm isapnp
.Nd introduction to ISA Plug-and-Play support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isapnp0 at isa?"
.Pp
An
.Nm
bus can be configured for each supported ISA bus.
.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Ox
provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for ISA Plug-and-Play (isapnp) autoconfiguration of
PnP-compatible
devices on an ISA bus.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Ox
includes machine-independent ISAPNP drivers, sorted by function
and driver name:
.Pp
.\" .Ss SCSI controllers
.\" .Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.\" .It aic
.\" Adaptec AHA-1520B SCSI controller card.
.\" .El

.Ss Serial and parallel interfaces
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It pccom
8250/16450/16550/16650/16850-compatible ISA PnP serial cards and internal
modems (i386 only).
.El
.\"
.Pp
.Ss Network interfaces
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It ep
3com 3c509B Etherlink-III Ethernet interface.
.It le
Ethernet driver for Lance based ethernet interface.
.\" .It ne
.\" NE2000-compatible ethernet interfaces.
.El
.\"
.Ss Sound cards
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It sb
Soundblaster series sound cards (SB16 PnP through AWE64).
.\" .It guspnp
.\" Gravis Ultrasound PnP sound cards.
.It ym
Yamaha OPL3-SA3 sound cards.
.El
.\" .Pp
.\" ISA Plug-and-Play devices also have alternate ISA drivers with
.\" static ISA IO address configuration.
.\" These are listed in 
.\" .Xr isa 4 .
.\" The
.\" .Nm
.\" bus ignores devices that have already been found and configured as
.\" .Xr isa 4
.\" devices.
.\" The
.\" .Nm
.\" bus is only effective on machines which lack a PnP BIOS, or where
.\" the PnP BIOS has been disabled.
.\" The manual pages for each individual 
.\" .Nm
.\" driver also list
.\" the supported front-ends for other buses.
