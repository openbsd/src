.Sh NAME
.Nm asc
.Nd
TurboChannel SCSI adaptor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "asc? at ioasic?"
.Cd "asc? at tc?"
.Cd "oldscsibus* at asc?"
.Cd "scsibus* at asc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the NCR 53c94-based scsi host adaptor
adaptor on the DECstation 5000 series, and for the PMAZ-AA and related
TurboChannel SCSI-adaptor option boards.
The
.Nm
is a medium-performance implementation of the SCSI-I common set
supporting synchronous and asynchronous SCSI devices.  The driver
provides no support for targets with multiple logical unit numbers
(LUNs).

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver only supports the
.Nm oldscsibus
higher-level layer, and the
.Nm rz
and
.Nm tz
devices, which first appeared in 
.Bx 4.4 /pmax.
It should be  re-written to support the
.Nm scsibus
machine-independent higher-level SCSI layer and the
.Nm sd ,
.Nm st ,
and
.Nm cd
drivers. This is
.Ud .
