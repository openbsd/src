.Sh NAME
.Nm lkkbd
.Nd LK200/LK400 keyboard driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lkkbd0 at dz0 line 0"
.Cd "wskbd* at lkkbd?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for DEC LK201 and LK401 keyboards connected to
.Xr dz 4
serial controllers within the
.Xr wscons 4
framework.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dz 4 ,

.\" .Xr wsconsctl 8
.Sh CAVEATS
The LK-201 keyboard does not have a
.Dq Meta
or
.Dq Alt
key.
For convenience,
.Ox
handles the
.Dq Compose
key as an
.Dq Alt
key, unless the
.Dq Shift
key is pressed as well.
.Pp
LK-401 keyboards have two
.Dq Alt
keys and two
.Dq Compose
keys, and do not exhibit this particular behaviour.
