.Sh NAME
.Nm autoconf
.Nd diagnostics from the autoconfiguration code
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Ox
bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine
on which it is running
and locates controllers, drives, and other devices, printing out
what it finds on the console.
This procedure is driven by a system configuration table which is processed by
.Xr config 8
and compiled into each kernel.
.Pp
If devices exist which are not configured they will be silently ignored;
if devices exist of unsupported type they will be noted.
.Pp
Normally, the system uses the disk from which it was loaded as the root
filesystem.
If such a system is booted with the
.Dv RB_ASKNAME
option (see
.Xr reboot 2 ) ,
then the name of the root device is read from the console terminal at boot
time, and any available device may be used.
