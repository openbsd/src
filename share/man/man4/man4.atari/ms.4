mouse interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device mouse 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Atari mouse interface works on a minimal emulation of Sun's Firm_event
structures. The primary reason for this is easy interfacing with X11.

.Pp
The movement and button events are read as structures of the form:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct Firm_event {
	u_int_16_t      id;       /* key or MS_* or LOC_[XY]_DELTA   */
	u_int_16_t      pad;      /* unused                          */
	int_16_t        value;    /* VKEY_{UP,DOWN} or locator delta */
	struct timeval  time;     /* time stamp of the event         */
}

.Pp
The values of 'id' concerning the mouse:
.Bd -literal
#define MS_LEFT         0x7f20    /* left mouse button */
#define MS_MIDDLE       0x7f21    /* middle mouse button */
#define MS_RIGHT        0x7f22    /* right mouse button */
#define LOC_X_DELTA     0x7f80    /* mouse delta-X */
#define LOC_Y_DELTA     0x7f81    /* mouse delta-Y */
.Ed

.Pp
The values of 'value' concerning a button event:
.Bd -literal
#define VKEY_UP         0         /* a button went up */
#define VKEY_DOWN       1         /* a button went down */
.Ed

The middle button event is generated by the driver on the Atari. It can
be triggered by simultaneously pressing the left and right buttons.

.Sh BUGS
The time interval that defines 'simultaneous' cannot be set.
