.Sh NAME
.Nm divert
.Nd kernel packet diversion mechanism
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Fd #include <netinet/in.h>
.Ft int
.Fn socket AF_INET SOCK_RAW IPPROTO_DIVERT
.Ft int
.Fn socket AF_INET6 SOCK_RAW IPPROTO_DIVERT
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Divert sockets are part of a mechanism completely integrated with
.Xr pf 4
that queues raw packets from the kernel stack to userspace applications,
and vice versa.
.Pp
A divert socket must be bound to a divert port through
.Xr bind 2 ,
which only the superuser can do.
Divert ports have their own number space, completely separated from
.Xr tcp 4
and
.Xr udp 4 .
When
.Xr pf 4
processes a packet that matches a divert rule (see
.Xr pf.conf 5
for details) it is immediately sent to the divert socket listening on the
port specified in the rule.
.Xr pf 4
reassembles TCP streams by default (if IP reassembly is not disabled)
before sending them to the divert sockets.
If there are no divert sockets listening, the packets are dropped.
.Pp
Packets can be read via
.Xr read 2 ,
.Xr recv 2 ,
or
.Xr recvfrom 2
from the divert socket.
The application that is processing the packets can then reinject them into the
kernel.
After being reinjected, inbound and outbound packets are treated differently.
Inbound packets are added to the relevant input queue and a soft interrupt is
scheduled to signal that a new packet is ready to be processed; outbound ones
are processed directly by the relevant IP/IPv6 output function.
The packets' checksums are recalculated upon reinjection.
.Pp
Writing to a divert socket can be achieved using
.Xr sendto 2
and it will skip
.Xr pf 4
filters to avoid loops.
A diverted packet that is not reinjected into the kernel stack is lost.
.Pp
Receive and send divert socket buffer space can be tuned through
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Xr netstat 1
shows information relevant to divert sockets.
.Pp
The IP_DIVERTFL socket option on the IPPROTO_IP level controls
whether both inbound and outbound packets are diverted (the default)
or only packets travelling in one direction.
It cannot be reset once set.
Valid values are
.Dv IPPROTO_DIVERT_INIT
for the direction of the initial packet of a flow, and
.Dv IPPROTO_DIVERT_RESP
for the direction of the response packets.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following PF rule queues outbound IPv4 packets to TCP port 80,
as well as the return traffic, on the em0 interface to divert port 700:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pass out on em0 inet proto tcp to port 80 divert-packet port 700
.Ed
.Pp
The following program reads packets on divert port 700 and reinjects them
back into the kernel.
This program does not perform any processing of the packets,
apart from discarding invalid IP packets.
