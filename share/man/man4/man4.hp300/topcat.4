as well as the
.Tn HP98548 ,
.Tn HP98549
and
.Tn HP98550
Catseye
and the
.Tn A1416A
Kathmandu
are accelerated frame buffers, with the following resolution and color depth:

.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a frame buffer abstraction to the
.Xr grf 4
driver, and the associated
.Xr ite 4
console framework.
.Pp
The Topcat, Catseye and Kathmandu display cards are not user configurable.
If one is present on a
system, it will always have a frame buffer address of 0x200000 and a control
register address of 0x560000.
These are the
.Tn HP
series 300
.Tn ITE
(Internal
Terminal Emulator) defaults.
The device can also be used as a graphics output device.
