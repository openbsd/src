.Sh NAME
.Nm ie
.Nd Intel i82596CA LAN coprocessor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ie0 at pcctwo0 offset 0x46000 ipl 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s
.Tn Ethernet
network via the
.Tn Intel
i82596CA 32-bit
Local Area Network Coprocessor for
.Tn Ethernet .
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.
.Pp
The i82596CA chip is integrated on both the
.Tn MVME187
and
.Tn MVME197
Single-Board Computers.
