.Sh NAME
.Nm vme
.Nd VMEbus interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vme0   at pcctwo0 offset 0x40000"
.Cd "vme0   at syscon0 offset 0x85000"
.Cd "vmes0  at vme0"
.Cd "vmel0  at vme0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the VMEbus.
On MVME187 and MVME197 boards, it operates the VMEchip2 ASIC connected to the
.Xr pcctwo 4
PCCchip2 local bus controller.
On MVME188 boards, it operates the VMEbus part of the
.Xr syscon 4
device.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver exposes the D16 and D32 access spaces through the
.Nm vmes
and
.Nm vmel
drivers, respectively.
.Pp
The currently VMEbus drivers supported are:
