.Sh NAME
.Nm esm
.Nd Dell Embedded Server Management
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "esm0 at mainbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the monitoring of the environmental sensors
present in a variety of Dell servers.
The hardware monitoring is accessed via the
.Va hw.sensors
.Xr sysctl 8
variable.
.Pp
Devices compatible with the
.Nm
driver can provide an arbitrary set of sensors which may include the
following types:
.Bl -column "temperature" "Units" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units"
.It Li "temperature" Ta "uK"
.It Li "fan" Ta "RPM"
.It Li "volts" Ta "uVDC"
.El
.Pp
Sensor data is updated every 10 seconds.
.Pp
The Embedded Server Management framework has been replaced in more recent
Dell systems with the Intelligent Platform Management Interface.
Servers using the Intelligent Platform Management Interface may be
monitored by the
.Xr ipmi 4
driver.
.Sh WATCHDOG
ESM provides watchdog timer functionality.
Once configured, if the watchdog is not reset within a x second timeout,
the server will reset.
The reset will occur regardless of the recoverability of the hang or crash.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Example of enabling a watchdog:
sysctl -w kern.watchdog.period=10
.El
.Pp
In this case if the watchdog is not reset it'll reboot the server after roughly
10 seconds.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Example of disabling watchdog:
sysctl -w kern.watchdog.period=0
