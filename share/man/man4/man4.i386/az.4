.Sh NAME
.Nm az 
.Nd Aztech/PackardBell radio card device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "az0   at isa? port 0x358"
.Cd "az0   at isa? port 0x350"
.Cd "radio* at az0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Aztech/PackardBell radio cards.
.Pp
The Aztech/PackardBell cards are stereo FM tuners that allow to tune
in the 87.5-108.0 MHz range.
It is capable to report signal status (tuned/not tuned, stereo/mono signal)
and force audio output to mono.
.Pp
The Aztech cards use only one I/O port.
The I/O port is set by the driver to the value specified in the configuration
file.
The I/O port must be one of
0x350 and 0x358.
.Sh BUGS
It is impossible to determine which frequency the card is tuned to.
Thus, the driver will report an internally stored value even if it is not
correct (changed by some program that uses direct port access).
