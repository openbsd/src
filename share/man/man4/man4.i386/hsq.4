.Sh NAME
.Nm hsq
.Nd
multiplexing serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hsq0 at isa? port 0x140 irq 10"
.Cd "com* at hsq? slave ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm hsq
driver provides support for boards that multiplex together up to four
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interfaces.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
device is the master device for up to four
.Nm com
devices.  The kernel configuration specifies these
.Nm com
devices as slave devices of the
.Nm
device, as shown in the synopsis.  The slave ID given for each
.Nm com
device determines which bit in the interrupt multiplexing register is
tested to find interrupts for that device.
The
.Tn port
specification for the
.Nm
device is used to compute the base addresses for the
.Nm com
subdevices and the port for the interrupt multiplexing register.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by Denis A. Doroshenko, based on the
.Xr ast 4
driver.
