.Osg
.Sh NAMEg
.Nm openpromg
.Nd OPENPROM interfaceg
.Sh SYNOPSISg
.Fd #include <machine/openpromio.h>g
.Sh DESCRIPTIONg
The fileg
.Nm /dev/openpromg
is an interface to the ULTRAsparc OPENPROM.g
This interface is highly stylized;g
ioctls are used for all operations.g
These ioctls refer tog
.Dq nodes ,g
which are simplyg
.Dq magicg
integer values describing data areas.g
Occasionally the number 0 may be used or returned instead,g
as described below.g
.Ppg
The calls that take and/or return a nodeg
use a pointer to ang
.Li intg
variable for this purpose;g
others use a pointer to ang
.Li struct opiocdescg
descriptor,g
which contains a node and two counted strings.g
The first string is comprised of the fieldsg
.Li op_nameleng
(ang
.Li int )g
andg
.Li op_nameg
(ag
.Li "char *" ) ,g
giving the name of a field.g
The second string is comprised of the fieldsg
.Li op_bufleng
andg
.Li op_buf ,g
used analogously.g
These two counted strings work in ag
.Dq value-resultg
fashion.g
At entry to the ioctl,g
the counts are expected to reflect the buffer size;g
on return,g
the counts are updated to reflect the buffer contents.g
.Ppg
The following ioctls are supported:g
.Bl -tag -width OPIOCGETOPTNODEg
.It Dv OPIOCGETOPTNODEg
Takes nothing, and fills in the options node number.g
.It OPIOCGETNEXTg
Takes a node number and returns the number of the following node.g
The node following the last node is number 0;g
the node following number 0 is the first node.g
.It Dv OPIOCGETCHILDg
Takes a node number and returns the number of the firstg
.Dq childg
of that node.g
This child may have siblings; these can be discovered by usingg
.Dv OPIOCGETNEXT .g
.It Dv OPIOCGETg
Fills in the value of the named property for the given node.g
If no such property is associated with that node,g
the value length is set to -1.g
If the named property exists but has no value,g
the value length is set to 0.g
.It Dv OPIOCSETg
Writes the given value under the given name.g
The OPENPROM may refuse this operation;g
in this caseg
.Dv EINVALg
is returned.g
.It Dv OPIOCNEXTPROPg
Finds the property whose name follows the given nameg
in OPENPROM internal order.g
The resulting name is returned in the value field.g
If the named property is the last, theg
.Dq nextg
name is the empty string.g
As withg
.Dv OPIOCGETNEXT ,g
the next name after the empty string is the first name.g
.Elg
.Sh FILESg
.Pa /dev/openpromg
.Sh ERRORSg
The following may result in rejection of an operation:g
.Bl -tag -width Erg
.It Bq Er EINVALg
The given node numberg
is not zerog
and does not correspond to any valid node,g
or is zero where zero is not allowed.g
.It Bq Er EBADFg
The requested operation requires permissions not specified at the call tog
.Fn open .g
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONGg
The given name or value fieldg
exceeds the maximum allowed length (8191 bytes).g
.Elg
.Sh SEE ALSOg
.Xr ioctl 2g
.Sh BUGSg
Due to limitations within the OPENPROM itself,g
these functions run at elevated priorityg
and may adversely affect system performance.g
