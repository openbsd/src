.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm creator
.Nd accelerated color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "creator* at mainbus0 flags 0x0"
.Cd "creator* at upa0 flags 0x0"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at creator?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Creator, Creator 3D and Elite 3D UPA
are color frame buffers, with graphics acceleration, available for most
of the UltraSPARC workstations with UPA or PCI slots.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces those frame buffers with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points but makes its functions
available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Pp
By default hardware acceleration is used to erase the screen and
scroll text.
By setting
.Ar flags
to
.Ar 1
(via
.Xr config 8
or
.Xr boot_config 8 )
this acceleration can be disabled.
