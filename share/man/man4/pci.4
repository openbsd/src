.Sh NAME
.Nm pci
.Nd introduction to PCI bus support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pci* at mainbus? bus ?"
.Cd "pci* at pchb? bus ?"
.Cd "pci* at ppb? bus ?"
.Pp
Other
.Nm
attachments are machine-dependent and depend on the bus topology and
.Tn PCI
bus interface of your system.
See
.Xr intro 4
for your system for details.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The system includes a machine-independent
.Tn PCI
bus subsystem and
several machine-independent
.Tn PCI
device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional
.Tn PCI
devices.
Drivers for
.Tn PCI
devices not listed here are machine-dependent.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
.Ss Details specific to the i386
Note that interrupt mappings on the i386 may require that you configure
your BIOS to reserve sufficient interrupts as "PCI/ISAPnP" so that there
are sufficient interrupts remaining to configure the discovered PCI
devices.
For more information, see
.Xr pcibios 4 .

.Sh IOCTLS
If the kernel is compiled with the
.Va USER_PCICONF
kernel option, the following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are supported by the
.Nm
driver.
They are defined in the header file
.Aq Pa sys/pciio.h .
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901234
.Pp
.It PCIOCREAD
This
.Xr ioctl 2
reads the
.Tn PCI
configuration registers specified by the passed-in
.Va pci_io
structure.
The
.Va pci_io
structure consists of the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width pi_width
.It pi_sel
A
.Va pcisel
structure which specifies the bus, slot and function the user would like to
query.
.It pi_reg
The
.Tn PCI
configuration register the user would like to access.
.It pi_width
The width, in bytes, of the data the user would like to read.
This value may be either 1, 2, or 4.  3-byte reads and reads larger than
4 bytes are not supported.
.It pi_data
The data returned by the kernel.
.El
.It PCIOCWRITE
This
.Xr ioctl 2
allows users to write to the
.Tn PCI
specified in the passed-in
.Va pci_io
structure.
The
.Va pci_io
structure is described above.
The limitations on data width described for
reading registers, above, also apply to writing
.Tn PCI
configuration registers.

Support for device listing and matching was re-implemented by
Kenneth Merry, and first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
