.Nd Broadcom NetXtreme II 10/100/Gigabit Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bnx* at pci?"
.Cd "brgphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports Broadcom's NetXtreme II product family, such as the
BCM5706 PCI-X and BCM5708 PCI Express Ethernet controllers, which
includes the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Dell PowerEdge 1950 integrated BCM5708 NIC (10/100/1000baseT)
.It
Dell PowerEdge 2950 integrated BCM5708 NIC (10/100/1000baseT)
.It
HP NC370F PCI-X Multifunction Gigabit server adapter (1000baseSX)
.It
HP NC370T PCI-X Multifunction Gigabit server adapter (10/100/1000baseT)
.It
HP NC373F PCI Express Multifunction Gigabit server adapter (1000baseSX)
.It
HP NC373i PCI Express Multifunction Gigabit embedded server adapter (10/100/1000baseT)
.It
HP NC380T PCI Express Dual Port Multifunction Gigabit server adapter (10/100/1000baseT)
.It
IBM xSeries 3550 integrated BCM5708 NIC (10/100/1000baseT)
.It
IBM xSeries 3650 integrated BCM5708 NIC (10/100/1000baseT)
.El
.Pp
The NetXtreme II product family is composed of various Converged NIC (or CNIC)
Ethernet controllers which support a TCP Offload Engine (TOE),
Remote DMA (RDMA), and iSCSI acceleration,
in addition to standard L2 Ethernet traffic,
all on the same controller.
The following features are supported in the
.Nm
driver under
.Ox :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
IPv4 transmit TCP/UDP checksum offload
IPv4 receive IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload
.\"Jumbo frames (up to 9022 bytes)
VLAN tag insertion
Interrupt coalescing
10/100/1000Mbps operation in full-duplex mode
10/100Mbps operation in half-duplex mode
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode via
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.
Only
.Cm full-duplex
mode is supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh FILES
The adapter needs a firmware file, which is loaded on demand by the
driver when the device is attached:
