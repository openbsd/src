.Sh NAME
.Nm nofn
.Nd Hifn 7814/7851/7854 HIPP1 crypto processor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "nofn* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards based on the
.Tn Hifn
.Tn 7814 ,
.Tn 7851 ,
and
.Tn 7854
.Tn HIPP1
packet processors.
The 7814 and 7854 both contain a public key processor and a random
number generator.
The public key processor registers with the
.Xr crypto 4
subsystem to support modular exponentiation,
and the random number generator provides random bits to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
.Pp
Currently, no packet processing is supported.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.2 .
