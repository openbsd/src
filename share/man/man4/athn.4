.Sh NAME
.Nm athn
.Nd Atheros IEEE 802.11a/g/n wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "athn* at cardbus?"
.Cd "athn* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for a wide variety of
Atheros 802.11n devices, ranging from the AR5008 up to the AR9287.
.Pp
The AR5008 (codenamed Owl) is the first generation of
Atheros 802.11n solutions.
It consists of two chips, a MAC/Baseband Processor and a Radio-on-a-Chip.
The MAC/Baseband Processor can be an AR5416 (PCI and CardBus form factors)
or an AR5418 (PCIe Mini Card form factor).
The radio can be an AR2122, AR2133, AR5122 or an AR5133 chip.
The AR2122 chip operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports up to 2
transmit paths and 2 receiver paths (2T2R).
The AR2133 chip operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports up to 3
transmit paths and 3 receiver paths (3T3R).
The AR5122 chip operates in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra and supports
up to 2 transmit paths and 2 receiver paths (2T2R).
The AR5133 chip operates in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra and supports
up to 3 transmit paths and 3 receiver paths (3T3R).
.Pp
The AR9001 (codenamed Sowl) is a Mini-PCI 802.11n solution.
It consists of two chips, an AR9160 MAC/Baseband Processor and an
AR9103 or AR9106 Radio-on-a-Chip.
The AR9103 chip operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports up to 3
transmit paths and 3 receiver paths (3T3R).
The AR9106 chip operates in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra and supports
up to 3 transmit paths and 3 receiver paths (3T3R).
.Pp
The AR9220, AR9223 and AR9280 (codenamed Merlin) are the
first generation of
Atheros single-chip 802.11n solutions.
The AR9220 and AR9223 exist in PCI and Mini-PCI form factors.
The AR9280 exists in PCIe Mini Card (XB92) and half Mini Card (HB92)
form factors.
The AR9220 and AR9280 operate in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra and
support 2 transmit paths and 2 receiver paths (2T2R).
The AR9223 operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports 2
transmit paths and 2 receiver paths (2T2R).
.Pp
The AR9281 is a single-chip PCIe 802.11n solution.
It exists in PCIe Mini Card (XB91) and half Mini Card (HB91) form
factors.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports 1 transmit path and
2 receiver paths (1T2R).
.Pp
The AR9285 (codenamed Kite) is a single-chip PCIe 802.11n solution that
targets the value PC market.
It exists in PCIe half Mini Card (HB95) form factor only.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports a single stream (1T1R).
It can be combined with the AR3011 chip to form a combo WiFi/Bluetooth
device (WB195).
.Pp
The AR2427 is a single-chip PCIe 802.11b/g solution similar to the other
AR9280 solutions but with 802.11n capabilities removed.
It exists in PCIe Mini Card form factor only.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum.
.Pp
The AR9227 and AR9287 are single-chip 802.11n solutions that
target mid-tier PCs.
The AR9227 exists in PCI and Mini-PCI form factors.
The AR9287 exists in PCIe half Mini Card (HB97) form factor only.
They operate in the 2GHz spectrum and support 2 transmit paths and 2
receiver paths (2T2R).
.Pp
The following table summarizes the supported chips and their capabilities.

.El
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the de facto encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
The
.Nm
driver relies on the software 802.11 stack for both encryption and decryption
of data frames.
.\" driver offloads encryption and decryption to the hardware for the WEP40,
.\" WEP104, TKIP(+MIC) and CCMP ciphers.
.Pp
The transmit speed is user-selectable or can be adapted automatically by the
driver depending on the number of hardware transmission retries.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures athn0 to join whatever network is available on boot,
using WEP key
.Dq 0x1deadbeef1 ,
channel 11, obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcp NONE NONE NONE nwkey 0x1deadbeef1 chan 11
.Ed
.Pp
Configure athn0 to join network
.Dq my_net
using WPA-PSK with passphrase
.Dq my_passphrase :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig athn0 nwid my_net wpa wpapsk \e
	`wpa-psk my_net my_passphrase`
.Ed
.Pp
Return athn0 to its default settings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig athn0 -bssid -chan media autoselect \e
	nwid "" -nwkey -wpa -wpapsk
.Ed
.Pp
Join an existing BSS network,
.Dq my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig athn0 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "athn%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "athn%d: radio is disabled by hardware switch"
The radio transmitter is off and thus no packet can go out.
The driver will reset the hardware.
Make sure the laptop radio switch is on.
.It "athn%d: radio switch turned off"
The radio switch has been turned off while the interface was up and running.
The driver will turn the interface down.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Damien Bergamini Aq damien@openbsd.org
based on source code licensed under the ISC released in 2008 by
Atheros Communications for Linux.
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support any of the 802.11n capabilities offered by
the adapters.
Additional work is required in
.Xr ieee80211 9
before those features can be supported.
