.Nd NetOctave NSP2000 crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "noct* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards based on the
.Tn NetOctave
.Tn NSP2000
packet processor.
The
.Tn NSP2000 contains a public key processor, random number generator, and
packet processor.
The random number generator provides random bits to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
.Pp
Currently, the he packet processor registers with the
.Xr crypto 9
subsystem only to support MD5 and SHA1.
The public key engine is not yet supported.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.2 .
