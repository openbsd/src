.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm systrace
.Nd enforce and generate policies for system calls
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device systrace" Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
attaches to processes and enforces policies for system calls.
A pseudo-device,
.Pa /dev/systrace ,
allows userland processes to control the behavior of
.Nm
through an
.Xr ioctl 2
interface.
.Sh SYSTEM CALL POLICIES
.Nm
can assign the following policies to system calls:
.Bl -tag -width SYSTR_POLICY_XXXXXX
.It SYSTR_POLICY_ASK
Send a message of the type
.Dv SYSTR_MSG_ASK ,
and put the process to sleep until a
.Dv STRIOCANSWER
.Xr ioctl 2
is made.
.It SYSTR_POLICY_PERMIT
Immediately allow the system call.
.It SYSTR_POLICY_NEVER
Immediately return an error code.
.El
.Sh SYSTRACE MESSAGES
A
.Xr read 2
operation on the
.Nm
pseudo-device will block if there are no pending messages, or
return the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct str_message {
	int msg_type;
#define SYSTR_MSG_ASK	1
#define SYSTR_MSG_RES	2
#define SYSTR_MSG_EMUL	3
#define SYSTR_MSG_CHILD	4
#define SYSTR_MSG_UGID		5
#define SYSTR_MSG_POLICYFREE	6
#define SYSTR_MSG_EXECVE	7
	pid_t msg_pid;
	short msg_policy;
	union {
		struct str_msg_emul msg_emul;
		struct str_msg_ugid msg_ugid;
		struct str_msg_ask msg_ask;
		struct str_msg_child msg_child;
		struct str_msg_execve msg_execve;
	} msg_data;
};

struct str_msg_emul {
	char emul[SYSTR_EMULEN];
};

struct str_msg_ugid {
	uid_t uid;
	gid_t gid;
};

struct str_msg_execve {
	char path[MAXPATHLEN];
};

struct str_msg_ask {
	int code;
	int argsize;
	register_t args[SYSTR_MAXARGS];
	register_t rval[2];
	int result;
};

struct str_msg_child {
	pid_t new_pid;
};
.Ed
These messages are all to the userland control process.
.Bl -tag -width SYSTR_MSG_XXXXXXXXXX
.It SYSTR_MSG_ASK
This message is sent whenever the kernel does not have a cached
simple policy for system call number
.Va code
within the currently set emulation.
.It SYSTR_MSG_RES
This message is sent whenever a system call is flagged with
SYSTR_FLAGS_RESULT.
.It SYSTR_MSG_EMUL
This message is sent whenever the emulation of a process changes.
.It SYSTR_MSG_CHILD
This message is sent whenever a process gains a child.
.It SYSTR_MSG_UGID
This message is sent whenever the effective UID or GID has changed
during the execution of a system call.
.It SYSTR_MSG_POLICYFREE
This is sent whenever the kernel frees the policy identified by
.Va msg_policy .
.It SYSTR_MSG_EXECVE
This message is sent whenever, before a call to 
.Xr execve 2
a process is privileged (technically, the process has the P_SUGID or
P_SUGIDEXEC flag set), but after the call, these priveliges have been
dropped.  The new image name is specified in the
.Va path
argument.
.El
.Sh IOCTL INTERFACE
.Nm
supports the following
.Xr ioctl 2
commands:
.Bl -tag -width STRIOCXXXXXXXX
.It Dv SYSTR_CLONE Fa "int"
Return a
.Nm
file descriptor for
further
.Xr ioctl 2
operations.
.El
.Bl -tag -width STRIOCXXXXXXXX
.It Dv STRIOCATTACH Fa "pid_t"
Attach to a process, unless:
.Bl -enum -compact -width 2n
.It
It's the process that's doing the attaching.
.It
It's a system process.
.It
It's being traced already.
.It
You do not own the process and you're not root.
.It
It's
.Xr init 8 ,
and the
kernel was not compiled with
.Cd option INSECURE .
.El
.It Dv STRIOCDETACH Fa "pid_t"
Wake up a process if it is waiting for an answer, and detach from it.
.It Dv STRIOCANSWER Fa "struct systrace_answer"
Tell
.Nm
what to do with a system call that was assigned a policy of
.Dv SYSTR_POLICY_ASK .
.Bd -literal
struct systrace_answer {
	pid_t stra_pid;	    /* PID of process being traced */
	int stra_policy;    /* Policy to assign */
	int stra_error;	    /* Return value of denied syscall
			       (will return EPERM if zero) */
	int stra_flags;
#define	SYSTR_FLAGS_RESULT 0x0001    /* Report syscall result */
};
.Ed
.It Dv STRIOCREPORT Fa "pid_t"
Report the current emulation a process is using inside the
.Va msg_emul
structure.
.It Dv STRIOCREPLACE Fa "struct systrace_replace"
Arrange for system call arguments to be replaced by arguments
supplied by the monitoring process.
.Bd -literal
struct systrace_replace {
	pid_t strr_pid;
	int strr_nrepl;		/* # of arguments to replace */
	caddr_t	strr_base;		/* Base user memory */
	size_t strr_len;		/* Length of memory */
	int strr_argind[SYSTR_MAXARGS];	/* Argument indexes */
	size_t strr_off[SYSTR_MAXARGS];	/* Argument offsets */
	size_t strr_offlen[SYSTR_MAXARGS]; /* Argument sizes */
};
.Ed
.It Dv STRIOCIO Fa "struct systrace_io"
Copy data in/out of the process being traced.
.Bd -literal
struct systrace_io {
	pid_t strio_pid;    /* PID of process being traced */
	int strio_ops;
#define	SYSTR_READ	1
#define	SYSTR_WRITE	2
	void *strio_offs;
	void *strio_addr;
	size_t strio_len;
};
.Ed
.It Dv STRIOCPOLICY Fa "struct systrace_policy"
Manipulate the set of policies.
.Bd -literal
struct systrace_policy {
	int strp_op;
#define	SYSTR_POLICY_NEW	1    /* Allocate a new policy */
#define	SYSTR_POLICY_ASSIGN	2    /* Assign policy to process */
#define	SYSTR_POLICY_MODIFY	3    /* Modify an entry */
	int strp_num;
	union {
		struct {
			short code;
#define SYSTR_POLICY_ASK	0

.Pp
The
.Dv SYSTR_POLICY_NEW
operation allocates a new policy with all entries initialized to
.Dv SYSTR_POLICY_ASK ,
and returns the new policy number into
.Va strp_num .
The
.Dv SYSTR_POLICY_ASSIGN
operation attaches the policy identified by
.Va strp_num
to
.Va strp_pid ,
with a maximum of
.Va strp_maxents
entries.
The
.Dv SYSTR_POLICY_MODIFY
operation changes the entry indexed by
.Va strp_code
to
.Va strp_policy .
.It Dv STRIOCGETCWD Fa "pid_t"
Set the working directory of the current process to that of the
named process.
.It Dv STRIOCRESCWD
Restore the working directory of the current process.
