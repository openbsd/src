.Sh NAME
.Nm ray
.Nd Raytheon Raylink / WebGear Aviator IEEE 802.11FH 2Mbps Wireless 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ray* at pcmcia?"
.Cd "option RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_DEFAULT=RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_USA"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the Raytheon Raylink and Aviator 2.4/PRO
802.11 Frequency Hopping 2Mbps wireless PCMCIA cards.
The cards can be operated in either adhoc or infrastructure modes.
The operating mode is selectable with
.Xr ifconfig 8
through a media option.
.Pp
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
WebGear Aviator 2.4
.It
WebGear Aviator PRO
.It
Raytheon Raylink WLAN
.El
.Pp
To communicate with other 802.11 cards a common network ID or NWID must
be specified on each station that wishes to participate in the shared
wireless network.
The NWID can be set with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The device uses IEEE 802.11 standard Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum
signaling and operates in the ranges of 2.400 to 2.4835 Gigahertz.
This frequency range is further restricted by country according to
that country's regulations.
Currently the
.Nm
driver defaults to using the ranges appropriate for the USA.
To change this setting you must define the kernel option
.Dv RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_DEFAULT
to one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
.Cd RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_USA
.It
.Cd RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_EUROPE
.It
.Cd RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_JAPAN
.It
.Cd RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_KOREA
.It
.Cd RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_SPAIN
.It
.Cd RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_FRANCE
.It
.Cd RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_ISRAEL
.It
.Cd RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_AUSTRALIA
.El
.Pp
The output power of the transceiver is 100mW and the card's power consumption
is 365 mA @ 5 volts.
The transmission range in open air (line of sight)
is a maximum of 1000 feet (or ~304 meters), and indoors (i.e., with
obstructions) it is a maximum of 500 feet (152 meters).
.Pp
.Tn Windows
drivers may use one of two framing modes for wireless packets,
"translation" and "encapsulation."
"Encapsulation" is the only framing
mode available when using some older
.Tn Windows
drivers.
.Pp
Setting
.Em link0
flag on the interface allows the
Ethernet2 in 802.11 "encapsulation" framing method used by
older
.Tn Windows
drivers for the card.
For all other purposes, link0 should not be used, and "translation"
should be selected if you are given the option in a newer
.Tn Windows
driver.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ray0: card failed self test: status x"
Indicates the card has failed its initial startup tests.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Christian E. Hopps Aq chopps@netbsd.org
and ported to
.Ox
by
.An Michael Shalayeff Aq mickey@openbsd.org .
Support for interoperating with newer
.Tn Windows
driver was added by
.An Steve Weiss Aq srw@alum.mit.edu .
.Sh BUGS
Currently the infrastructure mode is untested, and authentication
using WEP is unimplemented.
.Pp
Firmware version 4 does not interop with version 5 or higher.
