.Sh NAME
.Nm rt
.Nd AIMS Lab Radiotrack FM radio device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rt*   at isa? port 0x20c"
.Cd "rt*   at isa? port 0x30c"
.Cd "rt*   at isapnp?"
.Cd "radio* at rt?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the AIMS Lab Radiotrack FM radio tuners and
compatible - RadioReveal RA300 FM radio tuners and tuners at
SoundForte RadioX SF16-FMI (Creative ViBRA16C PnP).
.Pp
The Radiotrack is a stereo FM tuner that allows to tune in the range
87.5 - 108.0 MHz, report signal status on the current frequency, and
force audio output to mono.
.Pp
The card is based on the LM7000 chip, see
.Xr radio 4
for details.
.Pp
The Radiotrack cards take only one I/O port.
The I/O port is set by the driver to the value specified in
the configuration file and must be either 0x20c or 0x30c.
.Sh BUGS
Support for the SF16-FMI cards is rather ugly, the driver can not
determine signal state and force audio output to mono.
.Pp
It is impossible to determine the frequency tuned into.
Thus, the driver will report an internally stored value even if it is not
correct (e.g. tunning was done through the direct I/O access).
