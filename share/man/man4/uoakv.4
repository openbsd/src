.Nd Toradex OAK USB +/-10V 8channel ADC interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uoakv* at uhidev?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Toradex OAK seriese 10V device.
The sensor possesses a collection of sensor values which are
made available through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.

The ADC date unit is "VDC"(DC voltage) and the value is signed.
Because the Analog-Digital conversion cycle of the device is faster
than sensor framework update cycle, 
the driver keeps maximum/minimum/avelage values of each cycle as
indepent sensors.

The device has unique serial number. The serial number is indicated
in description part of sensor value.
