.Sh NAME
.Nm timeout_set ,
.Nm timeout_add ,
.Nm timeout_del
.Nd execute a function after a specified length of time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/timeout.h>
.Fn "timeout_set" "struct timeout *to" "void (*fn)(void *)" "void *arg"
.Fn "timeout_add" "struct timeout *to" "int ticks"
.Fn "timeout_del" "struct timeout *to"
.Fn "timeout_pending" "struct timeout *to"
.Fn "timeout_initialized" "struct timeout *to"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The finction
.Fn timeout_set
Prepares the timeout structure
.Fa to
to be used in future calls to
.Fn timeout_add
and
.Fn timeout_del .
The timeout will be preapared to call the function given in the
.Fa fn
argument with a
.Fa void *
argument given in the
.Fa arg
argument.
Once initialized, the
.Fa to
structure can be used in repeatedly in
.Fn timeout_add
and
.Fn timeout_del
and doesn't need to be reinitialized unless you wish to
change the function called and/or the argument to it.
.Pp
The function
.Fn timeout_del
schedules an execution of the
.Fa to
timeout in at least
.Fa ticks Ns No /hz
seconds.
Negative values of
.Fa ticks
are illegal. If the value is
.Sq 0
it will, in the current implementation, be treated as
.Sq 1
, but in the future it might cause an immediate timeout.
The timeout in the
.Fa to
argument must be already initialized by
.Fn timeout_set
and may not be used in calls to timeout_set until it has
timed out or been removed with
.Fn timeout_del .
If the timeout in the
.Fa to
argument is already scheduled, the old execution time will be
replaced by the new one.
.Pp
The function
.Fn timeout_del
will cancel the timeout in the argument
.Fa to .
If the timeout has already executed or has never been added
the call will have no effect.
.Pp
The
.Fn timeout_pending
macro can be used to check if a timeout is scheduled to run.
.Pp
The
.Fn timeout_initialized
macro can be used to check if a timeout has been initialized.
.Pp
It's the caller responsibility to provide those functions with
the timeout structures. No functions in this API will do memory
allocation. All functions in this API may be called in interrupt
context below
.Fn splclock .
.Pp
The old
.Fn timeout
and
.Fn untimeout
interface is implemented as wrappers around the new API, but it's
obsolete and will be removed in the future.
.Sh CODE REFERENCES
These functions are implemented in the file
.Pa sys/kern/kern_timeout.c .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hz 9 ,
.Xr sleep 9
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn timeout_add
function executes in linear speed depending on the number of pending
timeouts. It will also block all interrupts while inserting the timeout
to the timeout queue. Thus it is not recommended to use a large number
of timeouts in the system.
