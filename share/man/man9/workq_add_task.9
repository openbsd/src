.Dt WORKQ_ADD_TASK 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm workq_add_task ,
.Nm workq_create ,
.Nm workq_destroy
.Nd work queues
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/workq.h>
.Ft int
.Fn "workq_add_task" "struct workq *wq" "int flags" "void (*func)(void *, void *)" "void *arg1" "void *arg2"
.Ft struct workq *
.Fn "workq_create" "const char *name" "int maxthreads"
.Ft void
.Fn "workq_destroy" "struct workq *wq"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
workq
framework API provides a mechanism to defer tasks to a process context when
it is impossible to run such a task in the current context.
.Pp
.Fn workq_add_task
adds a task to the workq specified by the
.Pa wq
argument.
If
.Pa wq
is
.Dv NULL
the task will be run by the kernel's generic work queue.
Tasks in the kernel's generic work queue should not run for long periods of
time, they should use their own workq for task processing.
A task is specified by the
.Pa func
argument, and will be called with
.Pa arg1
and
.Pa arg2 .
Two arguments are allowed to provide additional flexibility to the called
function.
In many cases, one may wish to perform an action on a target.
Two arguments allow both target and action to be passed without
the need for a wrapper struct to contain them in a single argument.
The
.Pa flags
argument specifies creation and runtime characteristics of the task.
the possible flags are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width WQ_WAITOKXXX -compact
.It Dv WQ_WAITOK
Wait for resources to become available.
If resources are not available and this flag is not set then
.Fn workq_add_task
will return
.Dv NULL .
.El
.Pp
.Fn workq_create
creates a workq to be used when tasks would unnecessarily block the kernel
workq.
The
.Pa name
argument specifies the name of the kernel threads that run the tasks.
.Pa maxthreads
specifies the maximum number of worker threads that will service the work
queue.
.Pp
.Fn workq_destroy
causes the resources associated with a previously created workq to be freed.
It will wait till all the tasks in the work queue are completed before
returning.
.Pp
.Fn workq_add_task ,
.Fn workq_create ,
and
.Fn workq_destroy
can be called during
.Xr autoconf 9
or from process context.
.Fn workq_add_task
can additionally be called from interrupt context if
.Dv WQ_WAITOK
is not specified.

.Sh HISTORY
The workq framework was originally written by
.An Ted Unanst Aq tedu@openbsd.org ,
and heavily influenced by arguments with
.An David Gwynne Aq dlg@openbsd.org .
The workq framework first appeared in
.Ox 4.2 .
