.Sh NAME
.Nm radio
.Nd interface between low and high level radio drivers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The radio device driver is divided into a high level,
hardware independent layer, and a low level hardware
dependent layer.
The interface between these is the
.Va radio_hw_if
structure.
.Bd -literal
struct radio_hw_if {
	int	(*open)(void *, int, int, struct proc *);
	int	(*close)(void *, int, int, struct proc *);
	int     (*get_info)(void *, struct radio_info *);
	int     (*set_info)(void *, struct radio_info *);
	int     (*search)(void *, int);
};
.Ed
.Pp
The high level radio driver attaches to the low level driver
when the latter calls
.Va radio_attach_mi .
This call should be
.Bd -literal
.Ft void
.Fn radio_attach_mi "struct radio_hw_if *rhwp" "void *hdlp" \
                    "struct device * dev"
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va radio_hw_if
struct is as shown above.
The
.Va hdlp
argument is a handle to some low level data structure.
It is sent as the first argument to all the functions in
.Va radio_hw_if
when the high level driver calls them.
.Va dev
is the device struct for the hardware device.
.Pp
The fields of
.Va radio_hw_if
are described in some more detail below.
.Bd -literal
.Ft int
.Fn open "void *" "int flags" "int fmt" "struct proc *p"
  Optional.
  Is called when the radio device is opened.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

.Ft int
.Fn close "void *" "int flags" "int fmt" "struct proc *p"
  Optional.
  Is called when the radio device is closed.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

.Ft int
.Fn get_info "void *" "struct radio_info *"
  Fill the radio_info struct.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

.Ft int
.Fn set_info "void *" "struct radio_info *"
  Set values from the radio_info struct.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

.Ft int
.Fn search "void *" "int"
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
