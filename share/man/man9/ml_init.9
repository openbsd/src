.Sh DESCRIPTION
The mbuf list API provides implementions of data structures and operations
for managing lists of mbufs between contexts.
.Pp
mbuf_list structures support the following functionality:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact -offset indent
.It
Insertion of a new mbuf at the end of the list.
.It
Removal of an mbuf from the head of the list.
.It
Reinsertion of an mbuf at the head of the list.
.It
Removal of the entire chain of mbufs on the list.
.El
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fn "ml_init" "struct mbuf_list *ml"
Initialise the
.Fa ml
mbuf_list structure.
.It Fn "MBUF_LIST_INITIALIZER"
An initialiser for an mbuf_list structure declaration.
.It Fn "ml_enqueue" "struct mbuf_list *ml" "struct mbuf *m"
Enqueue mbuf
.Fa m
on the end of the
.Fa ml
mbuf list.
.It Fn "ml_dequeue" "struct mbuf_list *ml"
Dequeue an mbuf from the front of the
.Fa ml
mbuf list.
.It Fn "ml_requeue" "struct mbuf_list *ml" "struct mbuf *m"
Enqueue mbuf
.Fa m
at the head of the
.Fa ml
mbuf list.
.It Fn "ml_dechain" "struct mbuf_list *ml"
Dequeues all mbufs from the
.Fa ml
mbuf list.
.It Fo ml_filter
.Fa "struct mbuf_list *ml"
.Fa "int (*filter)(void *, struct mbuf *)"
.Fa "void *context"
.Fc
Iterates over the mbufs on the
.Fa ml
mbuf list, passing each of them to the
.Fa filter
function.
If the
.Fa filter
returns non-zero, the packet is removed from the
.Fa ml
mbuf list to be returned as part of an mbuf chain by
.Fn ml_filter .
.Fa context
is passed as the first argument to each call of
.Fa filter .
.It Fn "ml_len" "struct mbuf_list *ml"
Return the number of mbufs on the
.Fa ml
mbuf list.
.It Fn "ml_empty" "struct mbuf_list *ml"
Return if the
.Fa ml
mbuf list is empty.
.It Fn "MBUF_LIST_FOREACH" "struct mbuf_list *ml" "VARNAME"
A convenience macro that can be used to iterate over the contents of the
.Fa ml
mbuf list.
.Fa VARNAME
identifies the name (not the address) of an mbuf pointer that will
be set to each entry on the list.
Note that it is unsafe to modify the list while iterating over it.
.El
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn ml_init ,
.Fn ml_enqueue ,
.Fn ml_dequeue ,
.Fn ml_requeue ,
.Fn ml_dechain ,
.Fn ml_len ,
.Fn ml_empty ,
.Fn MBUF_LIST_INITIALIZER ,
and
.Fn MBUF_LIST_FOREACH
can be called during autoconf, from process context, or from interrupt context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn ml_dequeue
returns the mbuf that was at the head of its list.
If the list was empty,
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Pp
.Fn ml_dechain
returns all the mbufs that were on the list via
a pointer to an mbuf with the chain accessible via m_nextpkt members.
If the list was empty,
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Pp
.Fn ml_filter
returns the mbufs that were successfully matched by the filter
function on the list via a pointer to a chain of mbufs.
If no packets matched the filter,
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Pp
.Fn ml_len
returns the number of mbufs on the list.
.Pp
.Fn ml_empty
return a non-zero value if the list is empty, otherwise 0.
