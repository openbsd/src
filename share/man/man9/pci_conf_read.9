.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide a way for accessing PCI configuration space.
.Pp
The following types are defined in the MD include
.Pa Aq pci_machdep.h
file:
.Bl -tag -width pci_chipset_tag_t -offset indent
.It pci_chipset_tag_t
a PCI chipset descriptor;
.It pcitag_t
a PCI device tag;
.It pcireg_t
a PCI register datum.
.El
.Pp
In order to access PCI configuration space a device tag shall be made using
.Nm pci_make_tag
given the PCI chipset tag
.Ar pc
and the device specification in a tuple of
.Ar bus ,
.Ar device ,
.Ar function .
The PCI tag composition is a PCI chipset dependant operation
although often as simple as shift and logical OR combination.
Having a tag composed now it is possible to perform configuration
space read and write with
.Nm pci_conf_read
and
.Nm pci_conf_write
respectively.
Access to PCI configuration space is only provided for whole
.Nm pcireg_t
items that is usually a 32-bit integer.
Accesses to non-existant PCI devices do not (or should not) generate
any kinds of faults or interruptions and thus allow for an easy device
scanning by cycling through all possible device and function numbers
for a given bus.
.Pp
Below is an overview of defined PCI configuration space registers for
devices:
.Bl -tag -width 0xff -offset indent
.It 0x00
Vendor (lower word) and Product (higher word) identification.
(see
.Pa /sys/dev/pci/pcidevs
for a comprehensive list)
.It 0x04
Commands and Status register.
.It 0x08
PCI device's class and subclass ids.
See
.Pa /sys/dev/pci/pcireg.h
for PCI_CLASS_* and PCI_SUBCLASS_* definitions.
.It 0x0c
Specify (low byte to high): cache line size, PCI lattency timer, header type
and BIST.
.It 0x10 - 0x28
Base address registers for IO and memory space mapped registers.
.It 0x28
Cardbus CIS register.
.It 0x2c
Similar to 0x00 register's definitions for a subsystem identification.
.It 0x34
A pointer to the capabilities list.
Each item is an offset in the configuration space itself.
.It 0x3c
Interrupt line and pin numbers.
