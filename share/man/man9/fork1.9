.Dt FORK1 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fork1
.Nd create a new process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/proc.h>
.Ft int
.Fn "fork1" "struct proc *p1" "int flags" "void *stack" "size_t stacksize" "register_t *retval" 
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn fork1
creates a new process out of
.Ar p1 ,
which should be the current process.  This function is used primarily
to implement the
.Xr fork 2 ,
.Xr rfork 2 ,
.Xr vfork 2
system calls, as well as the
.Xr create_kthread 9 
function.
.Pp
The
.Ar flags
argument is used to control the behavior of the fork and is created by
a bitwise-OR of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width FORK_SHAREFILES
.It Dv FORK_FORK
The call is done by the
.Xr fork 2
system call. Used only for statistics.
.It Dv FORK_VFORK
The call is done by the
.Xr vfork 2
system call. Used only for statistics.
.It Dv FORK_RFORK
The call is done by the
.Xr rfork 2
system call. Used only for statistics.
.It Dv FORK_PPWAIT
Suspend the parent process until the child is terminated (by calling
.Xr _exit 2
or abnormally), or makes a call to
.Xr execve 2 .
.It Dv FORK_SHAREFILES
Let the child share the file descriptor table with the parent through
.Xr fdshare 9 .
The default behavior is to copy the table through
.Xr fdcopy 9 .
.It Dv FORK_CLEANFILES
The child starts with a clean file descriptor table created by
.Xr fdinit 9 .
.It Dv FORK_NOZOMBIE
The child will be dissociated from the parent and will not leave a status
for the parent to collect. See
.Xr wait 2 .
.It Dv FORK_SHAREVM
The child will share the parent's address space. The default behavior is
that the child gets a copy-on-write copy of the address space.
.El
.Pp
If
.Fa stack
is not 
.Dv NULL , 
the area starting at
.Fa stack
of extent
.Fa stacksize
will be used for the child's stack, instead of cloning the parent's
stack.
.Pp
If
.Fa retval
is not 
.Dv NULL , 
it will hold the following values after successful completion
of the fork operation:
.Bl -tag -width retval[0]
.It Fa retval[0]
This will contain the pid of the child process.
.It Fa retval[1]
In the parent process, this will contain the value 0.  In the child process,
this will contain 1.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion of the fork operation,
.Fn fork1
returns 0.  Otherwise, the following error values are returned:
.Bl -tag -width [EAGAIN]
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The limit on the total number of system processes would be exceeded.
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The limit
.Dv RLIMIT_NPROC
on the total number of processes under execution by this
user id would be exceeded.
.El
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
function semantics are specific to 
.Ox .
Other BSD systems have different semantics.
.Pp
The system never uses
.Fn fork1 
with a non-null
.Fa stack ,
so that feature is not even tested.
