.Sh NAME
.Nm rwlock ,
.Nm rw_init ,
.Nm rw_enter_read ,
.Nm rw_enter_write ,
.Nm rw_exit_read ,
.Nm rw_exit_write
.Nd interface to read/write locks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/rwlock.h>
.Ft void
.Fn rw_init "struct rwlock *rwl" "const char *name"
.Ft void
.Fn rw_enter_read "struct rwlock *rwl"
.Ft void
.Fn rw_enter_write "struct rwlock *rwl"
.Ft void
.Fn rw_exit_read "struct rwlock *rwl"
.Ft void
.Fn rw_exit_write "struct rwlock *rwl"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
set of functions provides a multiple-reader, single-writer locking mechanism to
ensure mutual exclusion between different processes.
.Pp
The
.Fn rw_init
function is used to initiate the lock pointed to by
.Fa rwl .
.Pp
The
.Fn rw_enter_read
function acquires a read lock, sleeping if necessary.
.Pp
The
.Fn rw_enter_write
function acquires a write lock, sleeping if necessary.
.Pp
The
.Fn rw_exit_read
function releases a read lock.
.Pp
The
.Fn rw_exit_write
function releases a write lock.
.Pp
Read locks can be acquired while the write lock is not held, and may coexist in
distinct processes at any time.
A write lock, however, can only be acquired when there are no read locks held,
granting exclusive access to a single process.
