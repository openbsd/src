.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide the interface for the UNIX file descriptors.
File descriptors can be used to access vnodes (see
.Xr vnode 9 ) ,
sockets (see
.Xr socket 2 ) ,
pipes (see
.Xr pipe 2 ) ,
kqueues (see
.Xr kqueue 2 ) ,
and various special purpose communication endpoints.
.Pp
A new file and a file descriptor for it are allocated with the function
.Fn falloc .
The
.Fa flags
argument can be used to set the
.Dv UF_EXCLOSE
flag on the new descriptor.
The larval file and fd are returned via
.Fa resultfp
and
.Fa resultfd ,
which must not be
.Dv NULL .
.Fn falloc
initializes the new file to have a reference count of two:
one for the reference from the file descriptor table and one
for the caller to release with
.Fn FRELE
when it's done initializing it.
.Pp
A file descriptor is freed with
.Fn fdrelease .
This releases the reference that it holds to the underlying file;
if that's the last reference then the file will be freed.
.\" with
.\" .Xr closef 9 .
.Pp
The files are extracted from the file descriptor table using the
functions
.Fn fd_getfile
.Fn fd_getfile
performs all necessary checks to see if the file descriptor number is
within the range of file descriptor table, and if the descriptor is
valid.
.Pp
The files are extracted from the process context using the
function
.Fn getsock
and
.Fn getvnode .
These functions are special cases that besides doing
.Fn fd_getfile
also check if the descriptor is a socket or a vnode respectively,
return the proper errno on error and increase the use count with
.Fn FREF .
.Sh CONCURRENT ACCESS
Since multiple processes can share the same file descriptor table,
it's important that the file is not freed in one process while some
other process is still accessing it.
To solve that problem a special use count is kept with the functions
.Fn FREF
and
.Fn FRELE .
In most cases
.Fn FREF
should be used on a file after it has been extracted
from the file descriptor table and
.Fn FRELE
should be called when the file won't be used anymore.
There are cases when this isn't necessary, but since
.Fn FREF
and
.Fn FRELE
are cheap to use, there is no reason to risk introducing bugs by
not using them.
.Sh CODE REFERENCES
The majority of those functions are implemented in
.Pa sys/kern/kern_descrip.c .
The function prototypes and the macros are located in
.Pa sys/sys/file.h
and
.Pa sys/sys/filedesc.h .
