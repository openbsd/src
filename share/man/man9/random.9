.Sh NAME
.Nm random
.Nd device kernel interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <dev/rndvar.h>
.Va void add_mouse_randomness(u_int32_t);
.br
.Va void add_tty_randomness(int);
.br
.Va void add_net_randomness(int isr);
.br
.Va void add_blkdev_randomness(u_int32_t);
.br
.Va void get_random_bytes(void *buf, size_t nbytes);
.br
.Va u_int32_t arc4random(void);
.br
.Sh DESCRIPTION
add_{mouse,tty,net,blkdev}_randomness routines used to supply data
for the random data source device for future processing.
.Pp
.Nm get_random_bytes
may be used to retrieve strong random data, just
as it would by
.Xr srandom 4
device.
.br
.Nm arc4random
will give random 32 bit numbers hashed with the aRC4 algorithm,
which appears to be faster.

.Xr arc4random 3
