.Sh DESCRIPTION
add_{mouse,tty,net,blkdev}_randomness routines used to supply data
for the random data source device for future processing.
.Pp
.Nm get_random_bytes
may be used to retrieve strong random data, just
as it would by
.Xr srandom 4
device.
.br
.Nm arc4random
will give random 32 bit numbers hashed with the aRC4 algorithm,
which appears to be faster.
