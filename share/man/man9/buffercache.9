.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is used by each filesystem to improve I/O performance using
in-core caches of filesystem blocks.
.Pp
The kernel memory used to cache a block is called a buffer and
described by a
.Em buf
structure.
In addition to describing a cached block, a
.Em buf
structure is also used to describe an I/O request as a part of
the disk driver interface.
.\" XXX struct buf, B_ flags, MP locks, etc.
.\" XXX free list, hash queue, etc.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn bread "vp" "blkno" "size" "cred" "bpp"
Read a block corresponding to
.Fa vp
and
.Fa blkno .
The buffer is returned via
.Fa bpp .
.Pp
If the buffer is not found (i.e. the block is not cached in memory),
.Fn bread
calls
.Fn getblk
to allocate a buffer with enough pages for
.Fa size
and reads the specified disk block into it.
.Pp
The buffer returned by
.Fn bread
is marked as busy.
(The
.Dv B_BUSY
flag is set.)
After manipulation of the buffer returned from
.Fn bread ,
the caller should unbusy it so that another thread can get it.
If the buffer contents are modified and should be written back to disk,
it should be unbusied using one of the variants of
.Fn bwrite .
Otherwise, it should be unbusied using
.Fn brelse .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Xo
.Fo breadn
.Fa "vp"
.Fa "blkno"
.Fa "size"
.Fa "rablks"
.Fa "rasizes"
.Fa "nrablks"
.Fa "cred"
.Fa "bpp"
.Fc
.Xc
Get a buffer as
.Fn bread .
In addition,
.Fn breadn
will start read-ahead of blocks specified by
.Fa rablks ,
.Fa rasizes ,
and
.Fa nrablks .
The read-ahead blocks aren't returned, but are available in cache for
future accesses.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn breada "vp" "blkno" "size" "rablkno" "rabsize" "cred" "bpp"
Same as
.Fn breadn
with single block read-ahead.
This function is for compatibility with old filesystem code and
shouldn't be used by new ones.
It simply calls
.Fn breadn
with
.Fa nrablks
set to 1.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn bwrite "bp"
Write a block.
Start I/O for write using
.Fn VOP_STRATEGY .
Then, unless the
.Dv B_ASYNC
flag is set in
.Fa bp ,
.Fn bwrite
waits for the I/O to complete.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn bawrite "bp"
Write a block asynchronously.
Set the
.Dv B_ASYNC
flag in
.Fa bp
and simply call
.Fn VOP_BWRITE ,
which results in
.Fn bwrite
for most filesystems.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn bdwrite "bp"
Delayed write.
Unlike
.Fn bawrite ,
.Fn bdwrite
won't start any I/O.
It only marks the buffer as dirty
.Pq Dv B_DELWRI
and unbusies it.
This routine should be used when the buffer is expected
to be modified again soon, typically a small write that
partially fills a buffer.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn getblk "vp" "blkno" "size" "slpflag" "slptimeo"
Get a block of requested size
.Fa size
that is associated with a given vnode and block
offset, specified by
.Fa vp
and
.Fa blkno .
If it is found in the block cache, mark it as having been found,
make it busy and return it.
Otherwise, return an empty block of the correct size.
It is up to the caller to ensure that the cached blocks
are of the correct size.
.Pp
If
.Fn getblk
needs to sleep,
.Fa slpflag
and
.Fa slptimeo
are used as arguments for
.Fn tsleep .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn geteblk "size"
Allocate an empty, disassociated block of a given size
.Fa size .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn incore "vp" "blkno"
Determine if a block associated with a given vnode and block offset
is in the cache.
If it is there, return a pointer to it.
Note that
.Fn incore
doesn't mark the buffer as busy unlike
.Fn getblk .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn allocbuf "bp" "size"
Expand or contract the actual memory allocated to a buffer.
If the buffer shrinks, the truncated part of the data
is lost, so it is up to the caller to have written
it out
.Em first
if needed; this routine will not start a write.
If the buffer grows, it is the caller's responsibility to fill out
the buffer's additional contents.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn brelse "bp"
Unlock a buffer by clearing the
.Dv B_AGE ,
.Dv B_ASYNC ,
.Dv B_BUSY ,
.Dv B_NOCACHE ,
and
.Dv B_DEFERRED
flags and release it to the free lists.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn biodone "bp"
Mark I/O complete on a buffer.
If a callback has been requested by
.Dv B_CALL ,
do so.
Otherwise, wake up the waiting processes.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn biowait "bp"
Wait for operations on the buffer to complete.
When they do, extract and return the I/O's error value.
