.Sh DESCRIPTION
The OpenBSD generic disk framework is designed to provide flexible,
scalable, and consistent handling of disk state and metrics information.
The fundamental component of this framework is the
.Nm disk
structure, which is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct disk {
	TAILQ_ENTRY(disk) dk_link;	/* link in global disklist */
	char	 *dk_name;	/* disk name */
	int	 dk_bopenmask;	/* block devices open */
	int	 dk_copenmask;	/* character devices open */
	int	 dk_openmask;	/* composite (bopen|copen) */
	int	 dk_state;	/* label state */
	int	 dk_blkshift;	/* shift to convert DEV_BSIZE to blks */
	int	 dk_byteshift;	/* shift to convert bytes to blks */

	/*
	 * Metrics data; note that some metrics may have no meaning
	 * on certain types of disks.
	 */
	int	  dk_busy;	/* busy counter */
	u_int64_t dk_xfer;	/* total number of transfers */
	u_int64_t dk_seek;	/* total independent seek operations */
	u_int64_t dk_bytes;	/* total bytes transferred */
	struct timeval	dk_attachtime;	/* time disk was attached */
	struct timeval	dk_timestamp;	/* timestamp of last unbusy */
	struct timeval	dk_time;	/* total time spent busy */

	struct	dkdriver *dk_driver;	/* pointer to driver */

	/*
	 * Disk label information.  Storage for the in-core disk label
	 * must be dynamically allocated, otherwise the size of this
	 * structure becomes machine-dependent.
	 */
	daddr_t	 dk_labelsector;	/* sector containing label */
	struct disklabel *dk_label;	/* label */
	struct cpu_disklabel *dk_cpulabel;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The system maintains a global linked-list of all disks attached to the
system.  This list, called
.Nm disklist ,
may grow or shrink over time as disks are dynamically added and removed
from the system.  Drivers which currently make use of the detachment
capability of the framework are the
.Nm ccd
and
.Nm vnd
pseudo-device drivers.
.Pp
The following is a brief description of each function in the framework:
.Bl -tag -width "disk_resetstat()"
.It Fn disk_init
Initialize the disklist and other data structures used by the framework.
Called by
.Fn main
before autoconfiguration.
.It Fn disk_attach
Attach a disk; allocate storage for the disklabel, set the
.Dq attached time
timestamp, insert the disk into the disklist, and intrement the
system disk count.
.It Fn disk_detatch
Detatch a disk; free storage for the disklabel, remove the disk
from the disklist, and decrement the system disk count.  If the count
drops below zero, panic.
.It Fn disk_busy
Increment the disk's
.Dq busy counter .
If this counter goes from 0 to 1, set the timestamp corresponding to
this transfer.
.It Fn disk_unbusy
Decrement a disk's busy counter.  If the count drops below zero, print
a warning message.
Get the current time, subtract it from the disk's timestamp, and add
the difference to the disk's running total.  Set the disk's timestamp
to the current time.  If the provided byte count is greater than 0,
add it to the disk's running total and increment the number of transfers
performed by the disk.
.It Fn disk_resetstat
Reset the running byte, transfer, and time totals.
.It Fn disk_find
Return a pointer to the disk structure corresponding to the name provided,
or NULL if the disk does not exist.
.El
.Pp
The functions typically called by device drivers are
.Fn disk_attach ,
.Fn disk_detatch ,
.Fn disk_busy ,
.Fn disk_unbusy ,
and
.Fn disk_resetstat .
The function
.Fn disk_find
is provided as a utility function.
.Sh USING THE FRAMEWORK
This section includes a description on basic use of the framework
and example usage of its functions.  Actual implementation of
a device driver which utilizes the framework may vary.
.Pp
A special routine,
.Fn disk_init ,
is provided to perform basic initialization of data structures used by
the framework.  It is called exactly once by the system, in
.Fn main ,
before device autoconfiguration.
.Pp
Each device in the system uses a
.Dq softc
structure which contains autoconfiguration and state information for that
device.  In the case of disks, the softc should also contain one instance
of the disk stucture, eg:
.Bd -literal
struct foo_softc {
	struct	device *sc_dev;		/* generic device information */
	struct	disk *sc_dk;		/* generic disk information */
	[ . . . more . . . ]
};
.Ed
.Pp
In order for the system to gather metrics data about a disk, the disk must
be registered with the system.  The
.Fn disk_attach
routine performs all of the functions currently required to register a disk
with the system including allocation of disklabel storage space,
recording of the time since boot that the disk was attached, and insertion
into the disklist.  Note that since this function allocates storage space
for the disklabel, it must be called before the disklabel is read from the
media or used in any other way.  Before
.Fn disk_attach
is called, a portions of the disk structure must be initialized with
data specific to that disk.  For example, in the
.Dq foo
disk driver, the following would be performed in the autoconfiguration
.Dq attach
routine:
.Bd -literal
void
fooattach(parent, self, aux)
	struct device *parent, *self;
	void *aux;
{
	struct foo_softc *sc = (struct foo_softc *)self;
	[ . . . ]

	/* Initialize and attach the disk structure. */
	sc->sc_dk.dk_driver = &foodkdriver;
	sc->sc_dk.dk_name = sc->sc_dev.dv_xname;
	disk_attach(&sc->sc_dk);

	/* Read geometry and fill in pertinent parts of disklabel. */
	[ . . . ]
}
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Nm foodkdriver
above is the disk's
.Dq driver
switch.  This switch currently includes a pointer to the disk's
.Dq strategy
routine.  This switch needs to have global scope and sould be initialized
as follows:
.Bd -literal
void	foostrategy __P((struct buf *));
struct	dkdriver foodkdriver = { foostrategy };
.Ed
.Pp
Once the disk is attached, metrics may be gathered on that disk.  In order
to gather metrics data, the driver must tell the framework when the disk
starts and stops operations.  This functionality is provided by the
.Fn disk_busy
and
.Fn disk_unbusy
routines.  The
.Fn disk_busy
routine should be called immediately before a command to the disk is
sent, eg:
.Bd -literal
void
foostart(sc)
	struct foo_softc *sc;
{
	[ . . . ]

	/* Get buffer from drive's transfer queue. */
	[ . . . ]

	/* Build command to send to drive. */
	[ . . . ]

	/* Tell the disk framework we're going busy. */
	disk_busy(&sc->sc_dk);

	/* Send command to the drive. */
	[ . . . ]
}
.Ed
.Pp
When
.Fn disk_busy
is called, a timestamp is taken if the disk's busy counter moves from
0 to 1, indicating the disk has gone from an idle to non-idle state.
Note that
.Fn disk_busy
must be called at
.Fn splbio .
At the end of a transaction, the
.Fn disk_unbusy
routine should be called.  This routine performs some consistency checks,
such as ensuring that the calls to
.Fn disk_busy
and
.Fn disk_unbusy
are balanced.  This routine also performs the actual metrics calculation.
A timestamp is taken, and the difference from the timestamp taken in
.Fn disk_busy
is added to the disk's total running time.  The disk's timestamp is then
updated in case there is more than one pending transfer on the disk.
A byte count is also added to the disk's running total, and if greater than
zero, the number of transfers the disk has performed is incremented.
.Bd -literal
void
foodone(xfer)
	struct foo_xfer *xfer;
{
	struct foo_softc = (struct foo_softc *)xfer->xf_softc;
	struct buf *bp = xfer->xf_buf;
	long nbytes;
	[ . . . ]

	/*
	 * Get number of bytes transferred.  If there is no buf
	 * associated with the xfer, we are being called at the
	 * end of a non-I/O command.
	 */
	if (bp == NULL)
		nbytes = 0;
	else
		nbytes = bp->b_bcount - bp->b_resid;

	[ . . . ]

	/* Notify the disk framework that we've completed the transfer. */
	disk_unbusy(&sc->sc_dk, nbytes);

	[ . . . ]
}
.Ed
.Pp
Like
.Fn disk_busy ,
.Fn disk_unbusy
must be called at
.Fn splbio .
.Pp
At some point a driver may wish to reset the metrics data gathered on a
particular disk.  For this function, the
.Fn disk_resetstat
routine is provided.
