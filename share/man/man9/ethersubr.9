.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm 
functions provide the interface between the
.Nm 
module and the network drivers which need Ethernet support.
Such drivers must request the
.Ar ether
attribute in their
.Ar files
declaration and call the appropriate functions as specified below.
.Pp
FDDI drivers must request the "fddi" attribute in their "files"
declaration and call the functions tagged with "fddi_" or "FDDI_"
instead, where different.
Some macros are shared.
.Pp
Note that you also need the
.Xr arp 9
stuff to support IPv4 on your hardware.
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn ether_ifattach
Perform the device-independent, but Ethernet-specific initialization of 
the interface pointed to by 
.Fa ifp .
.Pp
Among other duties, this function creates a record for the link level
address in the interface's address list and records the link level address
pointed to by
.Fa lla
there.
.Pp
You must call this function from the driver's attach function.
.It Fn fddi_ifattach
corresponding function for FDDI devices.
.It Fn ether_addmulti
.It Fn ether_delmulti
Add
.Pq Fn ether_addmulti
or delete
.Pq Fn ether_delmulti
the address described by the
.Fa ifr
pointer to the Ethernet multicast list belonging to
.Fa ec .
.Pp
These functions must be called from the driver's ioctl function to
handle
.Dv SIOCADDMULTI
and
.Dv SIOCDELMULTI
requests.
If they return
.Er ENETRESET ,
the hardware multicast filter must be reinitialized.
.Pp
These functions accept
.Dv AF_UNSPEC
addresses, which are interpreted as Ethernet addresses, or
.Dv AF_INET
addresses.
In the latter case,
.Dv INADDR_ANY
is mapped to a range describing all the Ethernet address
space reserved for IPv4 multicast addresses.
.Pp
.Fn ether_addmulti
returns
.Er EAFNOSUPPORT
if an unsupported address family is specified,
.Er EINVAL
if a non-multicast address is specified, or
.Er ENETRESET
if
the multicast list really changed and the driver should synchronize
its hardware filter with it.
.Pp
.Fn ether_delmulti
returns, in addition to the above errors,
.Er ENXIO
if the specified address
can't be found in the list of multicast addresses.
.It Fn fddi_addmulti
.It Fn fddi_delmulti
corresponding functions for FDDI devices.
.It Fn ETHER_NEXT_MULTI
is a macro to step through all of the ether_multi records, one at a time.
The current position is remembered in 
.Fa step , 
which the caller must provide. 
.It Fn ETHER_FIRST_MULTI
must be called to initialize 
.Fa step
and get the first record.  Both macros return a
.Dv NULL 
.Fa enm
when there are no remaining records.
.It Fn ETHER_IS_MULTICAST
returns 1, if 
.Fa addr
points to an Ethernet/FDDI multicast (or broadcast) address. 
Implemented as a macro.
