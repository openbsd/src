.Sh DESCRIPTION
This allocator provides DMA-safe memory provided using
.Xr pools 9 .
This allocator is safe to call in most contexts and is
typically used for temporary-use buffers up to 65536 bytes.
When buffers are used many times it may be better to consider
using other DMA-safe allocators.
.Pp
Interrupt protection has been set to
.Va IPL_VM
using
.Fn pool_setipl .
.Pp
The
.Ar flags
argument is a selection of
.Xr pool_get
flag arguments.
