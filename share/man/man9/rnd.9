.Nd device kernel interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <dev/rndvar.h>
.Va void add_keyboard_randomness(u_char scancode);
.br
.Va void add_net_randomness(int isr);
.br
.Va void add_blkdev_randomness(dev_t dev);
.br
.Va void get_random_bytes(void *buf, size_t nbytes);
.br
.Sh DESCRIPTION
add_{keyboard,net,blkdev}_randomness routines used to supply data
for the random data source device for future processing.
.Pp
get_random_bytes maybe used to retrive strong random data, just
as it would by
.Xr srnd 4
device.
