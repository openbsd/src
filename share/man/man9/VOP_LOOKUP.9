.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions implement a generic way to perform operations on vnodes.
The VOP function called passes the arguments to the correct file system
specific function.
Not all file systems implement all operations, in which case a generic
method will be used.
These functions exist to provide an abstract method to invoke vnode
operations without needing to know anything about the underlying file system.
Many syscalls map directly to a specific VOP function.
.Pp
The arguments for each VOP
function consist of one or more vnode pointers along with other data
needed to perform the operation.
Care must be taken to obey the vnode locking discipline when using
VOP functions.
The locking discipline for all currently defined VOP
functions is described in the file
.Pa sys/kern/vnode_if.src .
Many VOP calls take a struct proc *p argument.
This should be the current process.
VOP calls are not safe to call in an interrupt context.
.Pp
The following sections comment on the VOP functions from the consumer's
perspective.
Some notes for file system implementors follow.
.Sh VOP_CREATE
.Nm VOP_CREATE
creates a new directory entry for a regular file in the directory
.Ar dvp
and returns a locked, referenced vnode in
.Ar vpp .
The file name is in
.Ar cnp
and its permissions will be
.Ar vap .
.Sh VOP_FSYNC
.Nm VOP_FSYNC
flushes any dirty buffers associated with
.Ar vp
to disk.
The vnode is locked on entry and exit.
.Ar waitfor
can be set to MNT_WAIT to indicate VOP_FSYNC should not return
until all data is written.
.Sh VOP_GETEXTATTR
.Nm VOP_GETEXTATTR
and
.Nm VOP_SETEXTATTR
are called to get and set named extended file attributes (see
.Xr extattr 9 ) .
.Ar vp
is the vnode for which to get or set the attribute.
It must be locked.
.Ar attrnamespace
is an integer describing whether the attribute belongs in the
user or system namespace.
.Ar name
is the extended attribute to get or set.
.Ar uio
is a
.Xr uio 9
structure with the userland address containing the userland data.
VOP_GETEXTATTR will return the actual length of the attribute
in
.Ar size
if it is non-NULL.
.Ar cred
is a pointer to the credentials used to access the file.
.Sh VOP_LINK
.Nm VOP_LINK
increases the link count for the vnode
.Ar vp .
A new entry with name
.Ar cnp
should be added to the directory
.Ar dvp .
.Ar dvp
is locked on entry and unlocked on exit.
.Sh VOP_LOOKUP
.Nm VOP_LOOKUP
finds the file corresponding to the name
.Ar cnp
in the directory
.Ar dvp
and returns a vnode in
.Ar vpp .
.Ar dvp
is locked on entry and exit, and
.Ar vpp
is locked upon a successful return.
.Ar vpp
will be NULL on error, and cnp->cn_flags will be set to PDIRUNLOCK
if
.Ar dvp
has been unlocked for an unsuccessful return.
.Sh VOP_MKDIR
.Nm VOP_MKDIR
implements the mkdir syscall.
A new directory with name matching that in
.Ar cnp
and with permissions
.Ar vattr
will be created in the directory
.Ar dvp .
On success, the new vnode is returned locked in
.Ar vpp .
.Ar dvp
must be locked on entry and is unlocked on exit.
.Sh VOP_READLINK
.Nm VOP_READLINK
reads a symbolic link and returns the target's name in
.Ar uio .
.Ar vp
is locked on entry and exit and must be a symlink.
.Sh VOP_RECLAIM
.Nm VOP_RECLAIM
is used by
.Xr vclean 9
so that the file system has an opportunity to free memory
and perform any other cleanup activity related to
.Ar vp .
.Ar vp
is unlocked on entry and exit.
VOP_RECLAIM should not be used by generic code.
.Sh VOP_REMOVE
.Nm VOP_REMOVE
removes the link named
.Ar cnp
from the directory
.Ar dvp .
This file corresponds to the vnode
.Ar vp .
Both dvp and vp are locked on entry and unlocked on exit, and
each has its reference count decremented by one.
VOP_REMOVE does not delete the file from disk unless its link count
becomes zero (for file systems which support multiple links).
.Sh VOP_REVOKE
.Nm VOP_REVOKE
is used by the
.Xr revoke 2
syscall to prevent any further access to a vnode.
The vnode ops will be changed to those of deadfs, which returns only
errors.
.Ar vp
must be unlocked.
.Sh VOP_RMDIR
.Nm VOP_RMDIR
implements the rmdir syscall.
The directory
.Ar vp
will be removed from the directory
.Ar dvp .
Both are locked on entry and unlocked on exit.
The name of the directory for removal is additionally contained in
.Ar cnp .
.Sh VOP_SYMLINK
.Nm VOP_SYMLINK
creates a symbolic link with name
.Ar cnp
in the directory
.Ar dvp
with mode
.Ar vap .
The link will point to
.Ar target
and a vnode for it is returned in
.Ar vpp .
The directory vnode is locked on entry and unlocked on exit.
Note that unlike most VOP calls returning a vnode, VOP_SYMLINK
does not lock or reference
.Ar vpp .
.Sh VOP_UNLOCK
.Nm VOP_LOCK
is used internally by
.Xr vn_lock 9
to lock a vnode.
It should not be used by other file system code.
.Nm VOP_UNLOCK
unlocks a vnode.
.Ar flags
should be zero in most cases.
.Nm VOP_ISLOCKED
returns 1 if
.Ar vp
is locked and 0 if not.
It should be used cautiously, as not all file systems implement locks
effectively.
Note the asymmetry between vn_lock and VOP_UNLOCK.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.Nm VOP
functions are stubs which redirect their arguments to the
appropriate function for each file system.
In order to allow for layered file systems and generic bypass methods,
all vnode operation implementing functions take only a single void *
pointer as an argument.
This points to a structure containing the real arguments.
Additionally, this structure contains a struct vnodeop_desc *,
or vnodeop description.
The description is typically used by the abstract VOP code, but can
be useful to the lower implementation as well.
Every file system defines an array of struct vnodeopv_entry_desc
that contains one entry for each implemented vnode op.
Unimplemented vnode operations match the default description,
.Em vop_default_desc .
Most non-layer file systems should assign the default error handler,
.Em vn_default_error ,
to the generic description.
.Pp
All lower level implementations should conform to the interfaces described
above.
The rules for locking and referencing vnodes are enforced by each
file system implementation, not the VOP stubs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
functions return 0 to indicate success and a non-zero error code
to indicate failure.
