.Sh NAME
.Nm boot_config
.Nd how to change kernel configuration at boot
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm BOOT_CONFIG
is a kernel option that makes it possible to change the configuration
at boot time.
.Pp
The boot time configuration is invoked by the
.Fl c
option when OpenBSD prompts for a kernel to boot:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
>> OpenBSD BOOT 640/31744 k [1.29]
use ? for file list, or carriage return for defaults
use hd(1,a)/bsd to boot sd0 when sd0 is also installed
.No "Boot: [[[wd(0,a)]/bsd][-abcdrs]] :" Ic -c
Booting...

.It Ic add Ar dev
Add a device through copying another.
.It Ic base Ar 8 | 10 | 16
Change the base of numbers displayed and entered,
e.g. I/O addresses in a VAXen are octal.
.It Ic change Ar devno | dev
Modify one or more devices.
.It Ic disable Ar devno | dev
Disable one or more devices.
.It Ic enable Ar devno | dev
Enable one or more devices.
.It Ic exit
Continue boot.
.It Ic find Ar devno | dev
Find one or more devices.
.It Ic help
Give a short summary of all commands and their arguments.
.It Ic list
Show all known devices, a screen at a time.
.It Ic lines Op Ar count
Set the number of rows per page.
.It Ic quit
Continue boot.
.It Ic show Op Ar attr Op Ar val
Show all devices for which attribute
.Ar attr
has the value
.Ar val .

.Sh EXAMPLES
The ethernet card is not detected at boot because the kernel configuration
does not match the physical hardware configuration,
e.g. wrong IRQ in OpenBSD/i386.
The ethernet card is supposed to use the
.Xr ne 4
driver.

ne1 seems to match the configuration except it uses IRQ 5 instead of IRQ 10. So
the irq on ne1 should be changed via the
.Fa change
command. The device can be specified by either name or number.
.Pp

.Pp
Another case is a mistakenly detected non-existing device instead of another
device at the probed location.
One known case is the Mitsumi
CD-ROM in OpenBSD/i386. The simplest thing to solve that problem is to
disable mcd0.
.Pp
.Bd -literal
.No UKC> Ic find mcd0
 29 mcd0 at isa0 port 0x300 size 0 iomem -1 iosiz 0 irq 10 drq -1 drq2 -1

The show command is useful for finding which devices have a certain attribute.
It can also be used to find those devices with a particular value for
an attribute.

It is possible to add new devices, but only devices that were linked into the 
kernel. If a new device is added, following devices will be renumbered.

When configuration is completed, booting can proceed by issuing the
.Ic quit
or
.Ic exit
commands.
.Pp
.Bd -literal
.No UKC> Ic quit
Continuing...
mainbus0 (root)
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh BUGS
The add command is rather restricted, and might be expanded in the future.
.Pp
There is no way to save the configuration for next boot.
