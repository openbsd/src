.Sh NAME
.Nm BOOT_CONFIG
.Nd how to change kernel configuration at boot
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm BOOT_CONFIG
is a kernel option that make it possible to change the configuration
at boot time.
.Pp
The boot time configuration is invokes by a
.Fl c
option when OpenBSD ask for kernel to boot.

.Bl -tag -width "disable devno|dev" indent
.It add Ar dev
Add a device through copying another.
.It base Ar 8|10|16
Change the base for large numbers. E.g. I/O addresses in a VAXen are octal.
.It change Ar devno|dev
Modify one or more devices.
.It disable Ar devno|dev
Disable one or more devices.
.It enable Ar devno|dev
Enable one or more devices.
.It exit
Continue boot.
.It find Ar devno|dev
Find one or more devices.
.It help
Give a short summary of all commands and its arguments.
.It list
Show all known devices a screen at the time.
.It lines Op Ar count
Setup the number of rows per page.
.It quit
Continue boot.
.It show Op Ar attr Op Ar val
Show devices with an attribute and optional with a specified value.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Your ethernet card isn't found at boot because the configuration don't
match the hardware. E.g. wrong IRQ in OpenBSD/i386. You know that your
ethernet card is using the eddriver.

Ok, ed2 seems to match the configuration except IRQ 5 instead of IRQ 10. So
change irq on ed2 with the change command. Specify device by name or number.

Another case is when a none existing device is wrongly found when another 
device is found at the probed location. One known case is the Mitsumi none
ATAPI cdrom in OpenBSD/i386. The simplest thing to solve that problem is to
disable mcd0.

The show command is useful for finding which devices has a certain attribute.
It can even show us all devices with an certain value of the attribute.

It is possible to add devices, but only devices that already exists in the 
kernel. If a device is added all devices after is renumbered.
