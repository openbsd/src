.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm autoinstall
.Nd unattended OpenBSD installation and upgrade
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows unattended installation or upgrade of
.Ox
by automatically responding to installer questions with
answers from a response file.
.Nm
uses DHCP to discover the location of the response
file and HTTP to fetch the file.
.Ss AUTOINSTALL METHODS
The first method is to choose '(A)utoinstall' at the install prompt.
If there is only one network interface, the installer will fetch the response
file via that interface.
If there is more than one network interface, a selection is presented
and the installer fetches the response file via the selected interface.
.Pp
The second method is to netboot the machine.
In this situation
.Nm
feature will be invoked if the user does not intervene within
a short time.
It will behave as if the user selected '(A)utoinstall', but will
always fetch the response file via the netboot interface.
.Ss FETCHING THE RESPONSE FILE
.Nm
will use HTTP to fetch one of the files
.Ql install.conf
or
.Ql <MAC address>-install.conf
for install answers, and one of
.Ql upgrade.conf
or
.Ql <MAC address>-upgrade.conf
for upgrade answers.
The URL used to fetch the file is constructed from information provided in
the DHCP options
.Ql next-server
and
.Ql filename .
If
.Ql filename
is
.Ql auto_install
then the URLs tried are, in order:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http://<next-server>/<MAC address>-install.conf
http://<next-server>/install.conf
.Ed
.Pp
where <MAC address> is a string of six hex octets separated by colons
representing the MAC
address of the interface being used to fetch the files.
.Pp
If
.Ql filename
is
.Ql auto_upgrade
the URLs tried are, in order:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http://<next-server>/<MAC address>-upgrade.conf
http://next-server/upgrade.conf
.Ed
.Pp
On architectures where
.Ql filename
is used to provide the name of the file to netboot it is necessary to
create symbolic links called
.Ql auto_install
and
.Ql auto_upgrade
that point to the expected boot program
and to change the value of the filename option in the dhcpd.conf file
to be auto_install or auto_upgrade.
.Pp
Note that in these cases, the HTTP server and TFTP server must
be on the same machine.
.Ss RESPONSE FILE FORMAT
The format of a response file is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
question = answer
.Ed
.Pp
.Ql question
is an installer question (up to the question mark) or a non-ambiguous
part of it, consisting of whitespace separated words.
.Ql answer
is the answer to the question.
Passwords may be in plaintext, encrypted with
.Xr encrypt 1 ,
or set to
.Ql *************
(13 '*'s) to disable password logins, only permitting alternative access methods
(for example,
.Xr ssh 1
keys).
.Pp
If
.Nm
does not find an answer in the response file, the default answer as
provided by the installer is used.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/dhcpd.confXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/dhcpd.conf
dhcpd(8) configuration file
.It Pa install.conf
response file for unattended installation
.It Pa upgrade.conf
response file for unattended upgrade
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
A typical install.conf file will look something like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
System hostname = server1
Password for root = $2a$14$Z4xRMg8vDpgYH...GVot3ySoj8yby
Change the default console to com0 = yes
Which speed should com0 use = 19200
Setup a user = puffy
Password for user = *************
Public ssh key for user = ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1...g3Aqre puffy@ai
What timezone are you in = Europe/Stockholm
Location of sets = http
HTTP Server = ftp.eu.openbsd.org
.Ed
.Pp
The same file could be used for upgrades by creating a symbolic link called
upgrade.conf that points to install.conf.
The upgrade process will only use the answers it needs.
.Pp
And an example
.Xr dhcpd.conf 5
host entry:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
host foo {
  hardware ethernet 00:50:60:49:8b:84;
  fixed-address 192.168.2.180;
  filename "auto_install";
  option host-name "foo";
}
