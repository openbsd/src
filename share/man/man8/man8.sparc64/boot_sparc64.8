.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot_sparc64
.Nd sparc64 system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss System starts
When powered on, after a panic, or if the system is rebooted via
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
the PROM will proceed to its initialization, and will boot an operating
system if autoboot is enabled.
.Ss Boot process description
System boot blocks are installed near the start of the boot disk
using the procedure described in
.Xr installboot 8 .
The boot program attempts to load the kernel from the selected
boot device, which must currently be an SCSI
.Pq Pa sd
or IDE
.Pq Pa wd
disk drive, or a CD-ROM
.Pq Pa cd ,
or an SCSI tape drive
.Pq Pa st .
.Pp
The UltraSPARC Open Firmware
will normally look for a bootloader on the device specified by the
.Va boot-device
variable.
The
.Ox
bootloader will then look for a kernel named
.Pa bsd
by default, unless the
.Va boot-file
variable is set, or a different filename has been specified
in the boot command.
To reset this variable to its default, empty, value, type the following:
.Pp
.D1 Sy ok Li set-default boot-file
.Pp
To boot from a
.Xr softraid 4
volume by default,
.Va boot-device
must be set to a disk device hosting a chunk of the softraid volume:
.Pp
.D1 Sy ok Li setenv boot-device disk0
.Pp
and
.Va boot-file
must contain the
.Pq Pa sr
device name of the softraid volume and optionally a partition letter
and/or kernel:
.Pp
.D1 Sy ok Li setenv boot-file sr0a:/bsd
.Pp
Autoboot is enabled by setting the
.Va auto-boot?\&
variable to
.Dq true ,
and is the factory default.
.Ss Boot process options
The following options are recognized:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "-XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Fl a
Prompt for the root filesystem and swap devices after the devices have
been configured.
.It Fl c
Enter the
.Dq User Kernel Configuration
mode upon startup
.Pq see Xr boot_config 8 .
.It Fl d
Enter the debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
as soon as the kernel console has been initialized.
.It Fl s
Boot the system single-user.
The system will be booted multi-user unless this option is specified.
.El
.Ss Accessing the PROM during runtime
If the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Va ddb.console
is enabled, at any time you can break back to the ROM by pressing the
.Sq L1
.Pq also known as the Dq stop key
and
.Sq a
keys at the same time (if the console is a serial port the same is
achieved by sending a
.Dq break ) ,
and entering
.Ic machine prom
at the prompt.
If you do this accidentally you can continue whatever was in progress
by typing
.Ic go
at the PROM prompt, and then
.Ic cont
to return to the system.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/mdec/ofwboot.net -compact
.It Pa /bsd
default system kernel
.It Pa /bsd.rd
standalone installation kernel, suitable for disaster recovery
.It Pa /usr/mdec/bootblk
primary bootstrap for
.Dq ffs
file system
.It Pa /usr/mdec/ofwboot
secondary bootstrap (usually also installed as
.Pa /ofwboot )
.It Pa /usr/mdec/ofwboot.net
network bootstrap
.It Pa /usr/mdec/ofwbootfd
floppy disk bootstrap
