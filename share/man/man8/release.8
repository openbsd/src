.Sh DESCRIPTION
There are several steps necessary to build a system release.
They are:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact -offset indent
.It
Update sources.
.It
Build and install a new kernel.
.It
Build a new system.
.It
Make and validate the system release.
.It

.It
Make and validate the xenocara release.
.It
Make the third party packages.
.El
.Pp
The following sections describe each of the required steps in detail.
.Pp
Commands to be run as a user with write permissions on the source and
ports trees
.Pf ( Ns Pa /usr/src
and
.Pa /usr/ports
respectively)
are preceded by a dollar sign
.Pq Sq $ .
Commands that must be run as the superuser are preceded by a hash mark
.Pq Sq # .
.Ss 1. Update sources
A
.Nm
should always start from a known set of
.Em coherent
sources.
The easiest way to ensure that the sources are complete and coherent
is to check them out using the
.Tn CVS
tag the
.Ox
developers add to the repository prior to making a release.
There are two tags, one which identifies the release as it exists on the
.Tn CD-ROM
and another which identifies the
.Em stable
branch.
The
.Em stable
branch, starting with
.Ox 2.7 ,
contains the patches described in
.Lk http://www.openbsd.org/errata.html .
The tags are of the form:
.Bl -tag -width OPENBSD_x_y_BASE
.It Va OPENBSD_x_y_BASE
This tag marks the source as it exists on the release
.Tn CD-ROM
where
.Ar x
is the major release number and
.Ar y
is the minor release number.
.It Va OPENBSD_x_y
This tag is a moving target.
It marks the sources that belong to the stable branch.
This branch
.Em only
contains errata, no new features.
.El
.Pp
To update your sources to the versions identified by one of the above
tags use the commands:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ cd /usr/src && cvs up -r TAG -Pd
$ cd XSRCDIR && cvs up -r TAG -Pd
$ cd PORTSPATH && cvs up -r TAG -Pd
.Ed
.Pp
Replace
.Va XSRCDIR
with the path to your X Window System sources.
Replace
.Va PORTSPATH
with the path to your ports tree sources, typically
.Pa /usr/ports .
The above commands assume an existing source tree.
.Pp
See
.Lk http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html
for instructions on fetching the sources for the first time.
.Pp
.Sy Warning :
.Tn CVS
tags are
.Sq sticky .
See
.Xr cvs 1
for more information.
.Ss 2. Build and install a new kernel
For safety, you should always build and install a new kernel before
building the programs that will use the kernel.
This ensures that any new system calls, for example, will be present
when needed.
To build a kernel the steps are:
.Pp
Change the current working directory.
.Va ${ARCH}
is the architecture of your machine, e.g.\&
.Li i386 .
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /usr/src/sys/arch/${ARCH}/conf
.Pp
Edit the kernel configuration file.
.Va ${NAME}
is your kernel configuration file.
You should
.Em not
edit
.Li GENERIC ;
create your own kernel configuration if you need to make modifications.
If using
.Li GENERIC
you can skip this step.
And yes, you may use
.Xr vi 1 ,
.Xr mg 1 ,
or any other editor you choose.
.Pp
.Dl $ vi ${NAME}
.Pp
Build the kernel compilation directory and compile the kernel:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ config ${NAME}
$ cd ../compile/${NAME}
$ make clean && make
.Ed
.Pp
(In this instance
.Li "make clean"
is your friend.)
.Pp
Replace the old kernel and reboot.
The current kernel is copied to
.Pa /obsd
and the new kernel to
.Pa /bsd .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ su
# make install
# shutdown -r now
.Ed
.Pp
If the system does not come up you can boot using
.Pa /obsd .
.Ss 3. Build a new system
Now that you are running your new kernel you can build a new system.
It's safer (but slower) to remove your object directories and re-create
them before the build.
The steps are:
.Pp
Move all your existing object files out of the way and then remove
them in the background:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ cd /usr/obj && mkdir -p .old && doas mv * .old && \e
	doas rm -rf .old &
.Ed
.Pp
Re-build your obj directories:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /usr/src && make obj
.Pp
Create directories that might be missing:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /usr/src/etc && doas DESTDIR=/ make distrib-dirs
.Pp
Begin the build:
.Pp
.Dl $ cd /usr/src && make SUDO=doas build
.Pp
Update
.Pa /etc ,
.Pa /var ,
and
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV ,
either by hand or using
.Xr sysmerge 8 .
.Pp
At this point your system is up-to-date and running the code that you
are going to make into a release.
.Ss 4. Make and validate the system release
The system release consists of at least one generic kernel,
some installation media, the release
.Sq tarballs ,
installation instructions, and checksum files.
.Pp
The release process requires two work areas.
They are:
.Bl -tag -width "RELEASEDIR "
.It Va DESTDIR
This is the name of a directory which will be the root of a complete
.Ox
installation, thus it must be on a disk partition large enough to store the
entire operating system (less the X Window System and any third party
.Sq packages ) .
The directory can be removed once the release is created.
In any case the release process ensures the directory is empty before starting.
.It Va RELEASEDIR
This is the name of a directory where the release output files are stored.
The following process will create the directory if necessary.
.It " "
.Sy Warning :
.Va DESTDIR
and
.Va RELEASEDIR
must not refer to any directory with
.Pa /mnt
in its path, as
.Pa /mnt
is used in the release generation process.
Additionally the first
.Xr vnd 4
device, vnd0,
is also used and must not be configured.
.El
.Pp
The release process is:
.Pp
Ensure
.Va ${DESTDIR}
exists as an empty directory and
.Va ${RELEASEDIR}
exists.
.Va ${RELEASEDIR}
need not be empty.
You must be root to create a release:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ su
# export DESTDIR=your-destdir; export RELEASEDIR=your-releasedir
# test -d ${DESTDIR} && mv ${DESTDIR} ${DESTDIR}- && \e
	rm -rf ${DESTDIR}- &
# mkdir -p ${DESTDIR} ${RELEASEDIR}
.Ed
.Pp
Make the release and check that the contents of
.Va ${DESTDIR}
pretty much match the contents of the release
.Sq tarballs :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cd /usr/src/etc && make release
# cd /usr/src/distrib/sets && sh checkflist
# unset RELEASEDIR DESTDIR
.Ed
.Pp
At this point you have most of an
.Ox
release.
The only thing missing is the X Window System
(which is covered in the next section).
.Ss 5. Build and install xenocara
.Va Xenocara
is based on the X.Org modular build system.
Xenocara sources are supposed to be in
.Va XSRCDIR
which defaults to
.Pa /usr/xenocara .
This variable should be set in
.Xr mk.conf 5
if a non-default value is used.
The
.Pa /usr/src
tree is also needed while building xenocara.
The following steps will build and install everything for the first time.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ su
# cd XSRCDIR
# make bootstrap
# make obj
# make build
.Ed
.Pp
The X Window System is created and installed in
.Pa /usr/X11R6 .
.Ss 6. Make and validate the xenocara release
.Va xenocara
uses
.Va DESTDIR
and
.Va RELEASEDIR
as described above.
While they may be set to the values used to build the rest of the
system, be aware that the existing contents of
.Va DESTDIR
will be removed as part of the xenocara build (this is necessary for
release checklist processing).
.Pp
The steps to build the release are (assuming you are still root, and still in
.Va XSRCDIR ) :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# export DESTDIR=your-destdir; export RELEASEDIR=your-releasedir
# test -d ${DESTDIR} && mv ${DESTDIR} ${DESTDIR}- && \e
	rm -rf ${DESTDIR}- &
# mkdir -p ${DESTDIR} ${RELEASEDIR}
# make release
# unset RELEASEDIR DESTDIR
.Ed
.Pp
At this point you have both
.Ox
system and X Window System
.Sq tarballs
in your release directory.
.Ss 7. Make the third party packages
The
.Sq ports
subsystem of contributed applications is capable of producing
.Sq packages
for installation, either individually or in bulk.
This is described in
.Xr ports 7 .
