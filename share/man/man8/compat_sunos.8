.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_sunos
.Nd setup procedure for m68k and sparc architectures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
OpenBSD/sparc and some of the OpenBSD/m68k architectures can run
SunOS executables.  Most executables will work.
.Pp
The SunOS compatibility feature is active
for kernels compiled with the
.Nm COMPAT_SUNOS
option enabled.
.Pp
The exceptions include programs that use the SunOS kvm library,
and various system calls, ioctl()'s, or kernel semantics
that are difficult to emulate.
The number of reasons why a program might fail to work is (thankfully)
longer than the number of programs that fail to run.
.Pp
Static executables will normally run without any extra setup.
This procedure details the directories and files that must be
setup to allow dynamically linked executables to work.
.Pp
The files you need are on your SunOS machine.
You need to worry about the legal issues of ensuring that you
have a right to use the required files on your machine.
On your OpenBSD machine, do the following:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -inset -offset 123 -compact
.It
.Li mkdir -p /emul/sunos/usr/lib /emul/sunos/usr/5lib
.fi
.Pp
.It
.Li cp SunOS:/usr/lib/lib*.so.*.* OpenBSD:/emul/sunos/usr/lib
.Pp
.It
.Li cp SunOS:/usr/5lib/lib*.so.*.* OpenBSD:/emul/sunos/usr/5lib
.Pp
.It
.Li cp SunOS:/usr/lib/ld.so OpenBSD:/emul/sunos/usr/lib/ld.so
.Pp
.It
If you ever expect to use YP, you will want to create a link:
.nf
.Li ln -s /var/run/ypbind.lock /etc/ypbind.lock
.fi
.El
.Pp
Alternatively, you can use an NFS mount to accomplish the same
effect.
On your OpenBSD machine, do the following:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -inset -offset 123 -compact
.Pp
.It
.Li mkdir -p /emul/sunos/usr
.Pp
.It
.Li mount SunOS:/usr /emul/sunos/usr
.fi
.El
.Pp
This will place the SunOS libraries on your OpenBSD machine
in a location where the SunOS compatibility code will look for
first, where they do not conflict with the standard libraries.
.Pp
.Sh BUGS
A list of things which fail to work in compatibility mode should
be here.
