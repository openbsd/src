.Dt RC.D 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.d
.Nd daemon control scripts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/rc.d/ Ns Ar daemon
.Op Fl df
.Ar action
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /etc/rc.d
directory contains shell scripts to start, stop, and reconfigure daemon
programs
.Pq Dq services .
.Pp
Services installed from
.Xr packages 7
may be started at boot time in the order specified by the
.Va pkg_scripts
variable from
.Xr rc.conf 8 ;
the order will be reversed during shutdown.
Services comprising
.Ox
base are started by
.Xr rc 8 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Setting this option will print the function names as they are called
and prevent the
.Xr rc.subr 8
framework from redirecting stdin and stderr to /dev/null.
This is used to allow debugging of failed
.Ar actions .
.It Fl f
Setting this option will force operations with the given action.
In case
.Ar daemon Ns _flags
if set to
.Dq NO ,
execution will continue with the script's own defaults unless other
flags are specified.
.El
.Pp
Each such script responds to the following
.Ar actions :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width restart -offset indent -compact
.It Cm start
Start the service, if not already running.
.It Cm stop
Stop the service.
.It Cm reload
Tell the daemon to reload its configuration.
.It Cm restart
Perform a stop, then a start.
.It Cm check
Return 0 if the daemon is running or 1 if it is not.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Daemon control scripts use a fixed number of
.Xr sh 1
variables when starting a daemon.
The following two can be overridden by site-specific values provided in
.Xr rc.conf.local 8 :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width daemon_flags -offset indent -compact
.It Ar daemon Ns _flags
Arguments to call the daemon with.
If set to
.Dq NO ,
it will prevent the daemon from starting even when listed in
.Va pkg_scripts .
.It Ar daemon Ns _user
User to run the daemon as, using
.Xr su 1 .
.El
.Pp
To obtain the actual variable names, replace
.Ar daemon
with the name of the script.
For example, postgres is managed through
.Pa /etc/rc.d/postgresql .
To run the daemon using a site-specific user account, define the following in
.Xr rc.conf.local 8 :
.Pp
.Dl postgresql_user=mypgsqluser
.Pp
Each script may define its own defaults, as explained in
.Xr rc.subr 8 .
.Pp
.Va daemon_class
is a special read-only variable.
It is set to
.Dq daemon
unless there is a login class configured in
.Xr login.conf 5
with the same name as the
.Nm rc.d
script itself,
in which case it will be set to that login class.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /etc/rc.d/
Directory containing daemon control scripts.
.It Pa /etc/rc.d/rc.subr
Functions and variables used by
.Nm rc.d
scripts.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rc 8 ,
.Xr rc.conf 8 ,
.Xr rc.subr 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Pa /etc/rc.d
directory
first appeared in
.Ox 4.9 .
.Sh BUGS
Changing
.Ar daemon Ns _flags
in
.Xr rc.conf.local 8
will change the corresponding pattern used with
.Xr pkill 1 ,
so that
.Ar actions
may not work on already running processes.
