.Dt RC.D 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.d
.Nd daemon control scripts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/rc.d/ Ns Ar daemon action
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /etc/rc.d
directory contains shell scripts to start, stop, and reconfigure daemon
programs
.Pq Dq services .
Currently, it is only used for daemons installed from
.Xr packages 7 ,
and not for the
.Ox
base system.
.Pp
Those services may be started at boot time in the order specified by the
.Va rc_scripts
variable from
.Xr rc.conf 8 ,
the order will be reversed during shutdown.
.Pp
Each such script responds to the following
.Ar actions :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width restart -offset indent -compact
.It Cm start
Start the service, if not already running.
.It Cm stop
Stop the service.
.It Cm reload
Tell the daemon to reload its configuration.
.It Cm restart
Perform a stop, then a start.
.It Cm check
Return 0 if the daemon is running or 1 if it is not.
.El
.Pp
Each script defines its own defaults, some of which can be overridden
by site-specific values provided in
.Xr rc.conf.local 8
.Po
variable names are obtained by replacing
.Ar daemon
with the name of the actual script
.Pc :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width daemon_flags -offset indent -compact
.It Ar daemon Ns _flags
Arguments to call the daemon with.
.It Ar daemon Ns _user
User to run the daemon as, using
.Xr su 1 .
.El
.Pp
For example, postgres is managed through
.Pa /etc/rc.d/postgresql .
To run the daemon using a site-specific user account, define the following in
.Xr rc.conf.local 8 :
.Pp
.Dl postgresql_user=mypgsqluser
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /etc/rc.d/
Directory containing daemon control scripts.
.It Pa /etc/rc.d/rc.subr
Functions and variables used by
.Nm rc.d
scripts.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rc 8 ,
.Xr rc.conf 8 ,
.Xr rc.subr 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Pa /etc/rc.d
directory
first appeared in
.Ox 4.9 .
.Sh BUGS
Changing flag values in
.Xr rc.conf.local 8
will change the corresponding pattern used with
.Xr pkill 1 ,
so that
.Ar stop
or
.Ar reload
may not work afterwards.
