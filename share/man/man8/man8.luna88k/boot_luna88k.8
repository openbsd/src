.Sh NAME
.Nm boot_luna88k
.Nd luna88k system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Boot process description
When powered on, or after a system reboot, the luna88k ROM monitor will
proceed to its initialization, and will boot the operating system
configured in nvram if autoboot is enabled.
.Ss DIP switches description
The behaviour of the ROM monitor, as well as some kernel options, are
controlled through the SW1 set of DIP switches on the front panel.
.Pp
The switch positions are not the same on Luna-88k and Luna-88k2 models.
On Luna-88k, a switch is enabled when in the
.Em down
position, while on the Luna-88k2, a switch is enabled when in the
.Em up
position.
.Pp
The following switches alter the ROM monitor behaviour:
.Bl -column "Switch" "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" "X"
.It Li Switch Ta Enabled Ta Disabled
.It " "
.It Li 1 Ta interact with ROM monitor Ta auto-boot
.It Li 2 Ta serial console Ta graphics console
.El
.Pp
The following switches alter the kernel behaviour:
.Bl -column "Switch" "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" "X"
.It Li Switch Ta Enabled Ta Disabled
.It " "
.It Li 1 Ta "boot in single-user mode" Ta "boot in multi-user mode"
.It Li 3 Ta "prompt for root device" Ta "do not prompt for root device"
.It Li 4 Ta "enter UKC mode" Ta "do not enter UKC mode"
.El
.Pp
For more details about the
.Dq User Kernel Configuration
mode
.Pq UKC ,
see
.Xr boot_config 8 .
.Pp
Note that the first switch controls both the kernel and the ROM monitor
behaviour.
.Ss Abnormal system termination
In case of system crashes, the kernel will usually enter the kernel
debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
unless it is not present in the kernel, or it is disabled via the
.Em ddb.panic
sysctl.
Upon leaving ddb, or if ddb was not entered, the kernel will halt the system
if it was still in device configuration phase, or attempt a dump to the
configured dump device, if possible.
The crash dump will then be recovered by
.Xr savecore 8
during the next multi-user boot cycle.
It is also possible to force other behaviours from ddb.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /bsd.rd -compact
.It Pa /bsd
default system kernel
.It Pa /bsd.rd
standalone installation kernel, suitable for disaster recovery

.Xr shutdown 8
.Sh CAVEATS
There is currently no standalone bootloader program on the Luna88k.
The
.Ox
kernel is loaded directly from the ROM monitor.
Because of this, kernel symbols are not available.
