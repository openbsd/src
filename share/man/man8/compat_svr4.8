.Dt COMPAT_SVR4 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_svr4
.Nd setup for running SVR4/iBCS2 binaries under emulation
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ox
supports running SVR4/iBCS2 binaries.
This code has been tested on i386 and sparc systems.
Most programs should work, but not ones that use or depend on:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact -offset indent
.It kernel internal data structures
.It the
.Pa /proc
filesystem
.It the ticotsord loopback rpc mechanism (NIS uses this)
.It sound and video interfaces
.It threads (ttsession uses threads)
.It the streams administrative driver
.El
.Pp
The SVR4 compatibility feature is active
for kernels compiled with the
.Nm COMPAT_SVR4
option and kern.emul.svr4
.Xr sysctl 8
enabled.
.Pp
Most SVR4 programs are dynamically linked.
This means that the shared libraries that the programs depend on
and the runtime linker are also needed.
Additionally, a "shadow root" directory for SVR4 binaries
on the
.Ox
system will have to be created.
This directory is named
.Pa /emul/svr4 .
Any file operations done by SVR4 programs run under
.Ox
will look in this directory first.
So, if a SVR4 program opens, for example,
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
.Ox
will
first try to open
.Pa /emul/svr4/etc/passwd ,
and if that does not exist open the `real'
.Pa /etc/passwd file .
It is recommended that SVR4 packages that include configuration
files, etc., be installed under
.Pa /emul/svr4 ,
to avoid naming conflicts with possible
.Ox
counterparts.
Shared libraries should also be installed in the shadow tree.
.Pp
The simplest way to set up the system for SVR4 binaries is:
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact
.It 1.
Make the necessary directories:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(me@openbsd) mkdir -p /emul/svr4/{dev,etc}
(me@openbsd) mkdir -p /emul/svr4/usr/{bin,lib}
(me@openbsd) mkdir -p /emul/svr4/usr/openwin/{bin,lib}
.Ed
.Pp
.It 2.
Copy files from an SVR4 system:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(me@svr4) cd /usr/lib
(me@svr4) tar -cf -\ . | \e
     rsh openbsd 'cd /emul/svr4/usr/lib; tar -xpf -'
.Ed
.Pp
If OpenWindows is going to be run:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(me@svr4) cd /usr/openwin/lib
(me@svr4) tar -cf -\ . | \e
     rsh openbsd 'cd /emul/svr4/usr/openwin/lib; tar -xpf -'
.Ed
.Pp
.It 3.
Set up the configuration files and devices:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(me@openbsd) cd /usr/src/etc/etc.svr4
(me@openbsd) cp netconfig nsswitch.conf /emul/svr4/etc
(me@openbsd) cp SVR4_MAKEDEV /emul/svr4/dev
(me@openbsd) cd /emul/svr4/dev; sh SVR4_MAKEDEV all
.Ed
.El
.Pp
An alternative method is to mount a whole SVR4 partition in
.Pa /emul/svr4
and then override with other mounts
.Pa /emul/svr4/etc
and
.Pa /emul/svr4/dev .
.Pp
Clearly, a complete SVR4
.Pa /dev
directory cannot be used as
.Pa /emul/svr4/dev ,
because other device nodes, such as
.Pa /dev/null ,
need to be
.Ox
device nodes.
.Sh BUGS
Many system calls are still not emulated.
The streams emulation is incomplete (socketpair does not work yet).
.Pp
Most SVR4 executables can not handle directory offset cookies > 32
bits.
More recent ones, compiled for large file support (Solaris 2.6 and up) can.
With older programs, the message
"svr4_getdents: dir offset too large for emulated program"
will appear when this happens.
Currently, this can only happen on NFS mounted filesystems, mounted from
servers that return offsets with information in the upper 32 bits.
These errors should rarely happen, but can be avoided by mounting this
filesystem with the
.Fl 2
option to
.Xr mount_nfs 8 .
