.Dt RC.SUBR 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.subr
.Nd functions used by
.Xr rc.d 8
scripts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Ic .\& Pa /etc/rc.d/rc.subr
.Pp
.It
.Ic rc_cmd Ar argument
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
script
contains commonly used shell script functions and variable
definitions which are used by various
.Xr rc.d 8
scripts.
.Pp
The
.Nm
functions are accessed by sourcing
.Pa /etc/rc.d/rc.subr
into the current shell.
.Pp
The following shell functions are available:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Ic rc_cmd Ar argument
Run the
.Ar argument
method for the current
.Xr rc.d 8
script, based on the settings of various shell variables.
.Ic rc_cmd
is extremely flexible, and allows fully functional
.Xr rc.d 8
scripts to be implemented in a small amount of shell code.
For a given method
.Ar argument ,
if the
.Ar rc_${argument}()
function is not defined, then a default method is provided by
.Xr rc.subr 8 .
In addition methods can be disabled by setting the
.Ar rc_${name}
variable to
.Ar NO .
For example, if rc_reload=NO is set in the
.Ar rc.d 8
script, and
.Ic rc_cmd
is called with the reload argument, an error will be raised.
.Pp
.Ar argument
is searched for in the list of supported commands, which may be one
of:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm restart" -offset indent
.It Cm start
Start the service.
It checks if the service is already running by calling
.Ar rc_check
and refuses to start if it is.
In addition if the
.Ar rc_pre()
function exists, it is going to be called before
starting the daemon.
.It Cm stop
It checks that the service is running by calling
.Ar rc_check
and if it's not, no action is going to be taken.
In addition if the
.Ar rc_post()
function exists, it is going to be called right
after the daemon has been stopped.
.It Cm reload
Find the process using
.Xr pkill 1
with the regexp specified in the
.Ar pexp
variable and send a SIGHUP signal.
One has to make sure that sending SIGHUP to a daemon will
have the desired effect, which is reloading the configuration
files.
.It Cm restart
Perform a
.Cm stop
then a
.Cm start .
.It Cm check
Return 0 if the daemon is running or 1 if it is not.
.El
.Pp
.Ic rc_cmd
uses the following shell variables to control its behaviour.
.Bl -tag -width ".Va procname" -offset indent
.It Va daemon
The path to the daemon.
.It Va daemon_flags
Arguments to call
.Va daemon
with.
This is usually set in
.Xr rc.conf 5 ,
and not in the
.Xr rc.d 8
script except when there is a sane default value specified.
.Ar ${name}_flags
can be used in
.Xr rc.conf 5
to override this.
.It Va daemon_user
User to run
.Va daemon
as, using
.Xr su 1 .
This defaults to root unless specified by the
.Ar daemon_user
variable in the
.Xr rc.d 8
script or the
.Ar ${name}_user
variable in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Va daemon_class
Login class to run the
.Va daemon
with, using
.Xr su 1 .
This is a read only variable that gets populated by
.Xr rc.subr 8
itself. It searches
.Xr login.conf 5
for a login class that has the same name as the
.Xr rc.d 8
script itself and uses that. If no such login class
exists then daemon will be used.
.It Va daemon_shell
Shell to run the
.Va daemon
in, using
.Xr su 1 .
This defaults to /bin/sh unless specified by the
.Ar daemon_shell
variable in the
.Xr rc.d 8
script or the
.Ar ${name}_shell
variable in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Va pexp
A pattern to be passed to to
.Xr pgrep 1
or
.Xr pkill 1
in order to find the desired process.
By default this variable contains the
.Va daemon
and
.Va daemon_flags
variables.

.Sh FILES
