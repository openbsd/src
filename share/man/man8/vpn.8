.Dt VPN 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vpn
.Nd configuring the system for virtual private networks
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A virtual private network is used to connect two or more subnets via the
internet. For each subnet there is a security gateway which is connected
via a cryptographically secured tunnel to the security gateway of the other
subnet. In
.Ox
.Xr ipsec 4
is used to provide the necessary cryptographical services. This document
describes the configuration process for setting up a 
.Nm VPN .
.Pp
Both subnets need to configure
.Xr ipsec 4
routes with the 
.Xr ipsecadm 1 
tool:
.Pp
On the security gateway of subnet A:
.Bd -literal
ipsecadm flow -dst gatewB -spi 1 -addr netA netAmask netB netBmask -local
.Ed
.Pp
and on the security gateway of subnet B:
.Bd -literal
ipsecadm flow -dst gatewA -spi 1 -addr netB netBmask netA netAmask -local
.Ed
.Pp
Additionally both security gateways need to start the
.Xr photurisd 8
key management daemon with the
.Fl v
flag and have to make sure that it is configured properly on both sides to 
provide encryption and authentication.
.Pp
Now
.Xr ipf 1
needs to be configured that all packets from the outside are blocked.
Only packets from the security gateways either on the
.Pa enc0
interface or 
.Tn UDP
packets with source and remote ports of 468
should be allowed in.
