.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vpn
.Nd configuring the system for virtual private networks
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A virtual private network is used to securely connect two or more subnets
over the internet. For each subnet there is a security gateway which is
linked via a cryptographically secured tunnel to the security gateway of
the other subnet.
.Xr ipsec 4
is used to provide the necessary network-layer cryptographic services.
This document describes the configuration process for setting up a
.Nm VPN .
.Pp
Briefly, creating a VPN consists of the following steps:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
Choose a key exchange method: manual keyed, or automated via
.Xr isakmpd 8
or
.Xr photurisd 8 .
.It
For manual keying, create the Security Associations (SA), one for 
each endpoint.
.It
For manual keying, create the appropriate IPSec flows.
.It
For automated keying, create a configuration file for the keying
daemon.
.It
Configure your firewall rules appropriately.
.El
.Ss Choosing a key exchange method
There are currently three key exchange methods available:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -inset -compact
.It
manual (symmetric shared secret)
.It
.Xr isakmpd 8
.It
.Xr photurisd 8
.El
.Pp
At present, 
.Xr photurisd 8
has a limitation in that the IP adress of the security gateway must
fall within the range of adresses being tunnelled to, making VPNs
between (non-routable) private (RFC 1918) networks difficult.
This does not apply to 
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.Ss Enabling the Appropriate Kernel Operations
.Xr ipsec 4
operations must be first enabled using
.Xr sysctl 8 .
Before doing either manual or automated keying, or performing
encryption (ESP) or authentication (AH) operations, ensure the appropriate
kernel operation has been enabled:
.Bd -literal
sysctl -w net.inet.esp.enable=1
sysctl -w net.inet.ah.enable=1
.Ed
.Pp
and
.Bd -literal
sysctl -w net.inet.ip.ipsec-acl=1
.Ed
.Pp
if inbound packet verification is desired (strongly recommended).
.Pp
For security gateways, enabling packet forwarding is often
required:
.Bd -literal
sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
.Ed
.Pp
For more permanent operation, these options should be enabled in your
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 .
.Pp

.Ss Generating Manual Keys [manual keying]
The shared secret symmetric keys used to create a VPN can
be any hexadecimal value, so long as both sides of the connection use
the same values. Since the security of the VPN is based on these keys
being unguessable, it is very important that the keys be chosen using a
strong random source. One practical method of generating them
is by using the
.Xr random 4
device. To produce 160 bits (20 bytes) of randomness, for example, do a:
.Bd -literal
   openssl rand 20 | perl -pe 's/./unpack("H2",$&)/ges'
.Ed
.Pp
Different cipher types may require different sized keys.
.Pp
.Bl -column "Cipher" "Key Length" -compact
.It Em Cipher	Key Length
.It Li DES Ta "56 bits"
.It Li 3DES Ta "168 bits"
.It Li BLF Ta "Variable (160 bits recommended)"
.It Li CAST Ta "Variable (160 bits recommended)"
.It Li SKIPJACK Ta "80 bits"
.El
.Pp
Use of DES or SKIPJACK as an encryption algorithm is not recommended
(except for backwards compatibility) due to their short key length.
Furthermore, recent attacks on SKIPJACK have shown severe weaknesses
in its structure.
.Pp
Note that DES requires 8 bytes to form a 56-bit key and 3DES requires 24 bytes
to form its 168-bit key. This is because the most significant bit of each byte
is ignored by both algorithms.
.Ss Creating Security Associations [manual keying]
Before the IPSec flows can be defined, two Security Associations (SAs)
must be defined on each end of the VPN, e.g.:
.Bd -literal
ipsecadm new esp -spi SPI_OUT -src A_EXTERNAL_IP
         -dst B_EXTERNAL_IP -forcetunnel
         -enc 3des -auth sha1
         -keyfile ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE -authkeyfile AUTHENTICATION_KEY_FILE

ipsecadm new esp -spi SPI_IN -src B_EXTERNAL_IP
         -dst A_EXTERNAL_IP -forcetunnel
         -enc 3des -auth sha1
         -keyfile ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE -authkeyfile AUTHENTICATION_KEY_FILE
.Ed
.Pp
Note that the
.Fl key
and
.Fl authkey
options may be used to specify the keys directly in the
.Xr ipsecadm 8
command line.  However, another user could view the keys by using the
.Xr ps 1
command at the appropriate time (or use a program for doing so).
.Pp
.Ss Creating IPSec Flows [manual keying]
Both IPsec gateways need to configure
.Xr ipsec 4
routes with the
.Xr ipsecadm 8
tool:
.Pp
On the security gateway of subnet A:
.Bd -literal
ipsecadm flow -dst B_EXTERNAL_IP -spi SPI_OUT -proto esp
         -addr A_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255
               B_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255
ipsecadm flow -dst B_EXTERNAL_IP -spi SPI_OUT -proto esp
         -addr A_INTERNAL_NETWORK A_INTERNAL_NETMASK
               B_INTERNAL_NETWORK B_INTERNAL_NETMASK
ipsecadm flow -dst B_EXTERNAL_IP -spi SPI_OUT -proto esp
         -addr A_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255
               B_INTERNAL_NETWORK B_INTERNAL_NETMASK
ipsecadm flow -dst B_EXTERNAL_IP -spi SPI_OUT -proto esp
         -addr A_INTERNAL_NETWORK A_INTERNAL_NETMASK
               B_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255

ipsecadm flow -dst A_EXTERNAL_IP -spi SPI_IN -proto esp
         -addr B_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255
               A_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255 -ingress
ipsecadm flow -dst A_EXTERNAL_IP -spi SPI_IN -proto esp
         -addr B_INTERNAL_NETWORK B_INTERNAL_NETMASK
               A_INTERNAL_NETWORK A_INTERNAL_NETMASK -ingress
ipsecadm flow -dst A_EXTERNAL_IP -spi SPI_OUT -proto esp

ipsecadm flow -dst A_EXTERNAL_IP -spi SPI_OUT -proto esp
         -addr B_INTERNAL_NETWORK B_INTERNAL_NETMASK
               A_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255 -ingress
.Ed
.Pp
and on the security gateway of subnet B:
.Bd -literal
ipsecadm flow -dst A_EXTERNAL_IP -spi SPI_IN -proto esp
         -addr B_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255
               A_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255

         -addr A_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255
               B_INTERNAL_NETWORK B_INTERNAL_NETMASK -ingress
ipsecadm flow -dst B_EXTERNAL_IP -spi SPI_OUT -proto esp
         -addr A_INTERNAL_NETWORK A_INTERNAL_NETMASK
               B_EXTERNAL_IP 255.255.255.255 -ingress
.Ed
.Pp
.Ss Configure and run the keying daemon [automated keying]
Unless manual keying is used, both security gateways need to start 
either the
.Xr isakmpd 8
or
.Xr photurisd 8
key management daemon. To make sure the daemon is properly configured
to provide the required security services (typically, encryption and
authentication) start the daemon with debugging or verbose output.
.Pp
.Xr isakmpd 8
implements security policy using the
.Em KeyNote
trust management system.
.Ss Configuring Firewall Rules
.Xr ipf 8
needs to be configured such that all packets from the outside are blocked
by default. Only successfully IPSec-processed packets (from the
.Xr enc0 4
interface), or key management packets (for
.Xr photurisd 8 ,
.Tn UDP
packets with source and destination ports of 468, and for
.Xr isakmpd 8 ,
.Tn UDP
packets with source and destination ports of 500) should be allowed to pass.
.Pp
The
.Xr ipf 5
rules for a tunnel which uses encryption (the ESP IPsec protocol) and
.Xr photurisd 8
on security gateway A might look like this:
.Bd -literal
# ne0 is the only interface going to the outside.
block in log on ne0 from any to any
block out log on ne0 from any to any
block in log on enc0 from any to any

# Passing in encrypted traffic from security gateways
pass in proto esp from gatewB/32 to gatewA/32
pass out proto esp from gatewA/32 to gatewB/32

# Passing in traffic from the designated subnets.
pass in on enc0 from netB/netBmask to netA/netAmask

# Passing in Photuris traffic from the security gateways
pass in on ne0 proto udp from gatewB/32 port = 468 to gatewA/32 port = 468
pass out on ne0 proto udp from gatewA/32 port = 468 to gatewB/32 port = 468
.Ed
.Pp
If there are no other
.Xr ipf 5
rules, the "quick" clause can be added to the last three rules.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Manual keying
To create a manual keyed VPN between two class C networks using
3DES encryption and the following IP addresses:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
 A_INTERNAL_IP = 10.0.50.1
 A_EXTERNAL_IP = 192.168.1.254
 B_EXTERNAL_IP = 192.168.2.1
 B_INTERNAL_IP = 10.0.99.1
.Ed
.Pp
.Bl -enum
.It
Choose the shared secrets using a suitably random method. 
The 3DES encryption key needs 192 bits (3x64), or 24 bytes. 
The SHA-1 authentication key for needs 160 bits, or 20 bytes.
.Pp

.Tn UDP 
port 500. 
.Pp
For machineA, add:
.Bd -literal
# Permit ISAKMPD control traffic between A and B
pass in proto udp from 192.168.2.1/32 to 193.127.1.254/32 port = 500
pass out proto udp from 192.168.1.254/32 to 193.127.2.1/32 port = 500

.Xr photurisd 8
can not be used in VPN mode unless both of the security gateway IP addresses
lie within the network ranges being tunnelled to.
In situations where the gateway IP is outside the desired netrange, such
as with private (RFC 1918) networks, 
.Xr isakmpd 8
or manual keying must be used.
