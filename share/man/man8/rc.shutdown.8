.Dt RC.SHUTDOWN 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.shutdown
.Nd command script run at system shutdown
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When the system is administratively shut down using either the
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr halt 8
command,
.Xr rc 8
is invoked with the argument
.Dq shutdown ,
which checks for the existence of a
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
script to run before halting the system.
This script, like
.Xr rc.local 8 ,
executes the
.Xr rc.d 8
scripts specified by the rc_scripts variable in a reversed order.
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
is also for commands added by the system administrator.
.Pp
The
.Nm
script is also executed by
.Xr init 8
if a keyboard-requested halt is issued (for architectures that support this).
.Pp
If
.Nm
sets the variable
.Va powerdown
to
.Dq YES ,
.Xr halt 8
will attempt to power down the machine after it has halted.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr halt 8 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr rc 8 ,
.Xr rc.d 8 ,
.Xr reboot 8
