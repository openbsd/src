.Dt RC.CONF 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf ,
.Nm rc.conf.local
.Nd system daemon configuration database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm rc.conf
contains a series of variable assignments that are used to configure
the system daemons. These variables are read by
.Xr rc 8 early on in the boot sequence and every time a
.Xr rc.d 5
script is executed.
that are used to configure the system daemons.
.Pp
It is advisable to leave
.Nm rc.conf
untouched, and instead create and edit a new
.Nm rc.conf.local
file.
Variables set in this file will override variables previously set in
.Nm rc.conf .
.Pp
.Nm rc.conf
is made up of variable assignments
.Pq Ar variable Ns = Ns Ar value
with comments designated by a hash mark
.Pq Sq # .
.Pp
Some variables are used to turn features on or off.
For example, whether the system runs the
.Xr dhcpd 8
daemon is determined by the following line:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcpd_flags=NO
.Ed
.Pp
To run the dhcpd daemon,
add the following line to
.Nm rc.conf.local :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcpd_flags=
.Ed
.Pp
If instead some options are specified,
then the dhcpd daemon will be started with those options.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcpd_flags=-A abandoned
.Ed
.Pp
Other variables specify a simple YES or NO,
or simply determine the location of a file.
For example, the location of the ruleset for
.Xr pf 4
is given thus:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pf_rules=/etc/pf.conf           # Packet filter rules file
.Ed
.Pp
Finally there is the
.Va pkg_scripts
variable, responsible for starting and stopping
.Xr rc.d 8
scripts installed by packages in the specified order.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pkg_scripts=dbus_daemon cupsd
.Ed
.Pp
This will run
.Pa /etc/rc.d/dbus_daemon
then
.Pa /etc/rc.d/cupsd
with the
.Va start
argument at boot time,
and in reverse order with the
.Va stop
argument at shutdown.
