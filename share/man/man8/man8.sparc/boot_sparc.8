.Sh NAME
.Nm boot
.Nd
.Tn sparc-specific
system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
(as described in
.Xr fsck 8 ) ,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Ss Cold starts
System boot blocks are installed near the start of the boot disk
using the procedure described in
.Xr installboot 8 .
The boot program attempts to load the kernel from partition
.Dq a
of the boot device,
which must currently be an
.Dq sd ,
.Dq xd
or
.Dq xy
disk.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
flag to the bootloader will bring the system up in single-user mode.
The
.Fl a
flag instructs the system to prompt for the location of the root filesystem
and the primary swap partition.
The
.Fl c
flag instructs the system to enter the
.Dq User Kernel Config
mode upon startup (see
.Xr boot_config 8 ).
Other flags are currently ignored.
.Pp
The SPARC boot ROM comes in two flavours: an
.Dq old-style
ROM is used in
sun4 machines, while a
.Dq new-style
ROM can be found on sun4c and sun4m models.
The
.Dq new-style
SPARC boot ROM is a full-featured Forth system with emacs
key bindings.
It can be put in
.Dq old-style
user-interface compatibility
mode (in which case it shows a simple
.Dq \&>
prompt), but this is essentially
useless.
However, by default the ROM runs in old-mode; to enter new-mode type
.Dq n .
The ROM then shows a Forth-style
.Dq ok
prompt.
It is recommended to have the ROM always start in its native
.Dq new-style
mode.
Utter the following
incantation in new-mode to force the ROM to always start in new-mode:
.Pp
.Em \	ok
setenv sunmon-compat? false
.Ss Old-style PROM operation
By default, the old ROM will poll for boot devices, unless the eeprom settings
are set to specify a particular boot device.
The
.Ox
bootloader will then look for a kernel named
.Dq bsd
by default, unless a different filename has been specified in the boot
command.
.Pp
Refer to the
.Dq PROM User's Manual
for more information.
.Ss OpenBoot PROM version 1 operation
Older OpenBOOT PROM, as well as hybrid (dual-mode) versions operating in
compatibility mode (with the variable
.Dq version2?
set to false) will look for a bootloader and kernel filename as specified
by the
.Dq boot-from
variable.
To change the default so that
.Ox
will be loaded, type the following:
.Pp
.Em \	ok
setenv boot-from sd(0,0,0)bsd
.Pp
Replace
.Dq sd(0,0,0)
with the appropriate boot device if necessary.
.Ss OpenBoot PROM version 2 operation
Version 2 OpenBOOT PROM will look for a bootloader on the device specified
by the
.Dq boot-device
variable.
The
.Ox
bootloader will then look for a kernel named
.Dq bsd
by default, unless the
.Dq boot-file
environment variable is set, or a different filename has been specified
in the boot command.
To reset this variable to its default, empty, value, type the following:
.Pp
.Em \	ok
set-default boot-file
.Pp
.Ss Accessing the PROM during runtime
If the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Ev ddb.console
is enabled, at any time you can break back to the ROM by pressing the
.Dq L1
and
.Dq a
keys at the same time (if the console is a serial port the same is
achieved by sending a
.Dq break ) .
If you do this accidentally you can continue whatever was in progress
by typing
.Dq go .
