.Sh NAME
.Nm clang-local
.Nd OpenBSD-specific behavior of LLVM/clang
.Sh DESCRIPTION
On
.Ox ,
the LLVM/clang compiler exhibits the following characteristics:
.Bl -dash
.It
.Nm clang
does not search under
.Pa /usr/local
for include files or libraries:
as a system compiler, it only searches the system paths by default.
.It
.Nm clang
comes with stack protection enabled by default, equivalent to the
.Fl fstack-protector-strong
option on other systems.
The system will report any violation of the stack protector cookie along
with the function name via
.Xr syslog 3
at
.Dv LOG_CRIT
priority.
.It
.Nm clang
will generate PIE code by default, allowing the system to load the resulting
binary at a random location.
This behavior can be turned off by passing
.Fl fno-pie
to the compiler and
.Fl nopie
to the linker.
.It
The
.Fl fstrict-aliasing
option is turned off by default unless
.Fl Ofast
has been selected.
.It
.Nm clang
does not store its version string in objects.
There is no option to control this.
.It
The
.Fl pg
flag is an alias of
.Fl p .
.It
.Nm clang
does not warn for passing pointer arguments or assignment with
different signedness outside of
.Fl pedantic .
This can be
re-enabled with the
.Fl Wpointer-sign
flag.
.It
The warning option
.Fl Waddress-of-packed-member
is disabled by default.
.It
Color diagnostic messages are disabled by default and can be re-enabled with
.Fl fdiagnostics-color .
.It
The
.Fl fwrapv
option to treat signed integer overflows as defined is enabled by default to
prevent dangerous optimizations which could remove security critical overflow
checks.
.It
The
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr calloc 3 ,
.Xr realloc 3 ,
.Xr strdup 3 ,
.Xr strndup 3 ,
.Xr valloc 3
and
.Xr free 3
builtins are disabled to prevent undesirable optimizations of calls to
these functions.
