.Sh NAME
.Nm register-plist
.Nd smart diff and registration of packing-lists
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm register-plist
.Ar dir
.Op Ar pkgname ...
.Nm
.Fl t
.Ar p1
.Ar p2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to check that a packing-list for a given package name doesn't change.
By default, it is invoked at the end of
.Li make package ,
see
.Ev PACKAGE_REPOSITORY
in
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 .
Package names (package stem plus version) are used to uniquely identify
packages.
When something in the package changes, the package name should change,
usually by increasing
.Ev REVISION .
.Pp
.Nm
records a packing-list for each
.Ar pkgname
into the given directory
.Ar dir .
If no previous packing-list for the given pkgname exists, the packing-list
is recorded.
If a previous packing-list exists,
.Nm
compares both packing-list for discrepancies.
Whenever something significant changes,
.Nm
will display a diff of the differences, and exit with an error.
.Pp
Some items in the packing-list may change without actual problems.
For instance, dependencies are allowed to go forward.
On the other hand, some items like the package DESCR can't change at all.
Since this is a generated file, porters often overlook that items such as
the HOMEPAGE or the MAINTAINER's email address are embedded into that file,
and thus that changing these requires a REVISION bump.
.Pp
.Nm
can also be invoked with
.Fl t
and two packing-lists
.Ar p1
.Ar p2
to directly compare those packing-lists.
