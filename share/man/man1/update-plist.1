.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a helper script for the target
.Ar update-plist
in
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 .
.Pp
Along with options and environment variables,
.Nm
uses the exact same options and arguments that would be passed to
.Xr pkg_create 1 .
Since
.Xr pkg_create 1
normally takes one single actual
.Ar pkgname ,
there is no ambiguity in
.Ev MULTI_PACKAGES
situations.
.Pp
The first set of arguments correspond to the
.Sq default package .
.Pp
If
.Ev PORTS_PRIVSEP
is in effect,
.Nm
is run as root, but will switch back to
.Ev FAKE_TREE_OWNER
for scanning the installation directory and to
.Ev PORTS_TREE_OWNER
for writing packing-lists.
.Pp
.Nm
may need to know the
.Ev PORTSDIR
location in order to scan dependencies to trim common directories.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C Ar dir
Use a cache directory
.Ar dir
for scanning dependencies.
Beware that this directory should then be cleaned manually if the
dependencies's packing-lists change.
But this will speed up packing-list regeneration for ports with
lots of dependencies significantly.
.It Fl E Ar ext
Write new files with
.Ar ext
extension instead of the default
.Pa .new .
.It Fl e Ar ext
Preserve old files as
.Ar ext
extension instead of the default
.Pa .orig .
.It Fl F
Do not try to run
.Xr pkg_locate 1 .
.It Fl i Ar var
Ignore variable
.Ar var
for new substitutions.
Only existing substitutions will be considered for the new lists.
.It Fl j Ar jobs
Use
.Ar jobs
concurrent
.Xr pkg_locate 1
pipes.
Default is
.Sq hw.ncpu .
.It Fl n
Do not move the final packing-lists in position.
Instead, leave the
.Pa <file>.new
files for comparison.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode.
Do not display status progress messages.
Note that this is not the opposite of verbose mode.
.It Fl r
Run the
.Pa fake
directory scan as root.
.It Fl S Ar var
Consider variable for substitution only at the end of paths,
e.g., for suffixes like
.Pa .pyc
or
.Pa .pyo .
.It Fl s Ar var
Consider variable for substitution only at start of paths,
e.g., for directories like
.Pa /etc/rc.d
or
.Pa /usr/local .
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Explain about directories stripped from dependencies.
Note that this is not the opposite of quiet mode.
.It Fl w Ar suffix
Warn about suffixes such as
.Ar .orig
that (usually) should not end into packing-lists.
.It Fl X Ar path
Exclude file at absolute
.Ar path
from the information recorded in the packing-list.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
assumes all multi-packages live under the same installation directory
.Po
.Xr pkg_create 1 Ns 's
.Fl B
option
.Pc ,
and it will scan all paths under that directory and dispatch
them into corresponding subpackages, using the following heuristics:
.Bl -bullet
.It
files that were in existing packing-list(s) will be kept in the same
packing-list.
.It
new files and directories will be put in the packing-list that owns
the corresponding directory.
.It
baring that, new files will be put into the first packing-list whose PREFIX
fits.
.El
.Pp
As far as possible, everything that looks like actual files will be sorted
in alphabetical order, after variable substitutions.
.Pp
.Nm
will warn for a lot of conditions, such as pre-formatted manpages, or files
ending in pre-patch suffixes.
Adding a
.Cm @comment Ar intentional<reason>
will silence the warning.
For instance:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
@man man/ja_JP.EUC/cat1/kakasi.0
@comment intentional: mandoc does't handle this locale
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
will also scan dependencies, in order to strip common directories.
.Pp
If the
.Ar pkglocatedb
package is installed,
.Nm
will make use of it and report unregistered conflicts.
This can be disabled with
.Fl F
as it is time-consuming.
.Pp
Most
.Ev SUBST_VARS
variables will be back-substituted into the regenerated packing-lists,
starting from the longest variable values.
.Nm
tries to keep existing substitutions.
It does not add new substitutions on
.Ev BASE_PKGPATH
and
.Ev BUILD_PKGPATH ,
it does only substitute
.Ev FULLPKGNAME
in
.Pa share/doc/pkg-readmes
and it currently does not add new substitutions for
.Ev ARCH
nor
.Ev MACHINE_ARCH .
.Pp
Specific items such as shared libraries or binaries will gain annotations
and special handling, for instance
.Ev LIBlibname_VERSION .
.Pp
Existing packing-lists are scanned for non-file entries, such as
.Cm newuser ,
.Cm mode ,
or
.Cm exec
markers.
Those will be inserted into the updated packing-lists at the most likely
position.
.Pp
.Nm
will first write files as
.Pa <file>.new ,
then it will display which files are new and which files have changed.
If old packing-lists already exist, it will move old packing lists into
.Pa <file>.orig
unless these already exist, then move the new files into position.

.Xr pkg_create 1 ,
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5
.Sh BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
.Nm
might be the most complicated piece of the ports infrastructure.
There will always be cases that require manual intervention.
.
Since
.Ar fake
is now run as non-root,
.Nm
can't figure out users and groups for new files, so these should be
considered carefully.
