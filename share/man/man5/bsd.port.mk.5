.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bsd.port.mk
.Nd ports tree master Makefile fragment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <bsd.port.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
holds all the standard routines used by the ports tree.  Some variables
and targets are for its internal use only.  The rest is documented here.
.Pp
Other BSD, and older versions of 
.Nm
included other targets and variables. Conversion methods are outlined here.
.Pp
This is an incomplete draft, most variables and targets are not yet
documented.
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width do-configure
.It Ar build , Ar all
Default target. Build the port. Essentially invoke
.Bd -litteral -offset indent
    env -i ${MAKE_ENV} ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${MAKE_FLAGS} -f ${MAKE_FILE} ${ALL_TARGET}
.Ed
.It Ar configure
Configure the port. Might be a no operation. Unless overridden,
configure creates the ${WRKBUILD} directory (see SEPARATE_BUILD), runs
${SCRIPTDIR}/configure if it exists, and runs whatever configuration
methods are recorded in 
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE .
.It Ar distpatch
Apply distribution patches only.
.It Ar do-patch
Override for the default behavior of 
.Ar patch .
It is usually better to override
.Ar post-patch ,
as 
.Ar patch
needs to invoke
.Ar distpatch 
directly for historical reasons.
.It Ar extract
Extract the distfiles (but see 
.Ev EXTRACT_ONLY ).
.It Ar fake
Do a fake port installation, that is, simulate the port installation under
${WRKINST}.  Described in a separate section below.
.It Ar fetch
Fetch the distfiles and patchfiles.
.It Ar patch
Apply distribution and 
.Ox
specific patches.
.It Ar show
Invoked with VARNAME=name, show the contents of VARNAME.  Mostly used from
recursive makes, or to know the contents of another port's variables
without guessing wrong.
.El
.Sh VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev ARCH
Current machine architecture (read-only).
.It Ev AUTOCONF
Location of the autoconf binary if needed. Defaults to autoconf (though maybe
autoreconf might be more appropriate).
.It Ev AUTOCONF_DIR
Where to invoke autoconf if ${CONFIGURE_STYLE} includes autoconf.
Defaults to ${WRKSRC}.
.\" AUTOCONF_DIR should probably be a list, and be renamed to AUTOCONF_DIRS ?
.It BUILD_DEPENDS
List of other ports the current port needs to build correctly.
Each item has the form 
.Sq file_to_test::directory[:target] .
The double :: is designed to allow wedging a package specification in the
near future.  
.Sq target 
defaults to 
.Sq install
if it is not specified.
.Sq file_to_test 
is checked against the current path, or as an absolute
file name. The special name /nonexistent can be used to force a build
dependency (see the ghostscript port for an example).
.Sq directory 
is set relative to ${PORTSDIR}.
Build dependencies are checked at the beginning of the extract stage.
.It Ev CDROM_PACKAGES
Base location where packages suitable for a CDROM (see
PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM) will be placed 
(default: ${PORTSDIR}/cdrom-packages/${ARCH})
.It Ev CFLAGS
Default flags passed to the compiler for building. Many ports ignore it.
See also 
.Ev COPTS .
.It Ev CHECKSUM_FILE
Location for this port checksums, used at 
.Ar checksum
stage. Defaults to ${FILESDIR}/md5.
.It Ev CLEANDEPENDS
If set to 
.Sq Yes
.Sq make clean
will also clean dependencies. Note that distclean  never recurses down to
dependencies.
.It Ev CONFIGURE_SCRIPT
Set to name of script invoked by 
.Ar configure 
target, if appropriate. Should be relative to ${WRKSRC}.
.It Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
Set to style of configuration that needs to happen. 
If
.Sq perl ,
assume 
.Xr perl 1
.Xr ExtUtils::MakeMaker 3p
style.
If
.Sq gnu ,
assume
gnu configure style.
Add 
.Sq dest
if port does not handle DESTDIR correctly, and needs to be configured to
add DESTDIR to prefixes.
Add
.Sq old
if port is an older autoconf port, that does not recognize --sysconfdir.
Add
.Sq autoconf
if autoconf needs to be rerun first.
If
.Sq imake ,
assume port configures using X11 ports Imakefile framework.
If
.Sq simple ,
there is a configure script, but it does not fit the normal gnu configure
conventions.
.It Ev COPTS
Supplementary options appended to ${CFLAGS} for building. Since most ports
ignore the COPTS convention, they are actually told to use
${CFLAGS} ${COPTS} as CFLAGS.
.It Ev DIST_SUBDIR
Optionally subdirectory of ${DISTDIR} where the current port's distfiles
and patchfiles will be located. See target fetch.
.It Ev FAKE
Automatically set to 
.Sq Yes
for most ports (and all new ports). Indicates that the port, using
.Ev FAKE_FLAGS 
magic, will properly fake installation into ${WRKINST}, to be packaged
and properly installed from the package.  Set to 
.Sq No
in very rare cases, and during port creation.
.It Ev FAKE_FLAGS
Flags passed to ${MAKE_PROGRAM} on fake invocation. By default,
DESTDIR=${WRKINST}. If CONFIGURE_STYLE involves gnu, adds 
AM_MAKEFLAGS='DESTDIR=${WRKINST}' to take automatic care of recent automaker
recursive issues.
.It Ev FETCH_DEPENDS
See BUILD_DEPENDS for specification.  Fetch dependencies are checked at
the beginning of the extract stage. No current port uses FETCH_DEPENDS.
.It Ev FILESDIR
Location of other files related to the current ports. Holds at least the
checksum file, and sometimes other files (default: files.${ARCH} or files).
.It Ev FLAVOR
The port current options. Set by the user, and tested by the port to 
activate wanted functionalities.
.It Ev FLAVORS
List of all flavors keywords a port may match. Used to sort FLAVOR into
a canonical order to build the package name, or to select the packing-list, 
and as a quick validity check.
.It Ev FTP_PACKAGES
Base location where packages suitable for ftp (see
PERMIT_PACKAGE_FTP) will be placed 
(default: ${PORTSDIR}/ftp-packages/${ARCH})
.It Ev GMAKE
Location of the gnu make binary, if needed. Defaults to gmake.
.It Ev LIB_DEPENDS
Libraries this port depends upon. Similar to BUILD_DEPENDS, except that
.Sq file_to_test
is replaced by a 
.Sq lib_spec
of the form:
.Sq libname.[version.[subversion]] .
See BUGS AND LIMITATIONS as well.
.It Ev FULLDISTDIR
Complete path to directory where ${DISTFILES} and ${PATCHFILES} will be
located, to be used in hand-crafted extraction targets (read-only).
.It Ev IS_INTERACTIVE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if port needs human interaction to build. Usually implies NO_PACKAGE as
well.  Porters should strive to minimize IS_INTERACTIVE ports, by using
FLAVORS for multiple choice ports, and by postponing human intervention
to package installation time.
.It Ev LIBTOOL
Location of the libtool binary for ports that set
.Ev USE_LIBTOOL 
(default: ${LOCALBASE}/bin/libtool).
.It Ev LIBTOOL_FLAGS
Arguments to pass to libtool. If USE_LIBTOOL is set, the environment variable
LIBTOOL is set to ${LIBTOOL} ${LIBTOOL_FLAGS}.
.It Ev LOCALBASE
where other ports have already been installed (default: /usr/local)
.It Ev MAKE_FLAGS
Flags used for all make invocations, except for the fake stage, which uses
FAKE_FLAGS.
.It Ev MAKE_PROGRAM
The make program that is used for building the port. Set to ${MAKE} or
${GMAKE} depending on USE_GMAKE. Read-only.
.It Ev MTREE_FILE
.Xr mtree 1
specification to check when creating a PLIST with the
.Ar plist
target.  By default,
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree.
.It Ev NEED_VERSION
Specific revision of 
.Nm 
needed by this ports tree. Usually set to the current version of 
.Nm
when port was built, and updated by port maintainers when needed.
.It Ev NO_SHARED_LIBS
Set to 
.Sq Yes
if platform does not support shared libraries.  To be tested after
including 
.Nm bsd.port.mk ,
if neither PFRAG.SHARED nor CONFIGURE_SHARED are enough.
.It Ev OPSYS
Always OpenBSD (read-only).
.It Ev OPSYS_VER
Revision number of OpenBSD (read-only).
.It Ev PACKAGES
Base location for packages built (default: ${PORTSDIR}/packages/${ARCH}).
.It Ev PATCHDIR
Location for patches applied by patch target (default: patches.${ARCH} or
patches).
.It Ev PATCH_LIST
Wildcard pattern of patches to select under ${PATCHDIR} (default: patch-*).
Note that filenames ending in .orig, or ~ are never applied.
.It Ev PORTPATH
Path used by most shell invocations. Don't override unless really needed.
.It Ev PORTSDIR
Root of the ports tree (default: /usr/ports).
.It Ev PKGDIR
Location for packaging information (packing list, port description, port
short description). Default: pkg.${ARCH} or pkg.
.It Ev PREFERRED_CIPHERS
List of cryptographic ciphers to use, in order of preference. Defaults
is 
.Sq sha1 rmd160 md5 .
The first cipher that matches in ${CHECKSUM_FILE} is verified.
.It Ev PREFIX
Base directory for the current port installation. Usually ${LOCALBASE},
though some ports may elect a location under /var, and some multi-packages
ports may install under several locations.
.It Ev RUN_DEPENDS
Specification of ports this port needs installed to be functional.
Same format as BUILD_DEPENDS.  The corresponding packages will be built at
.Ar install
stage, and 
.Xr pkg_add 1
will take care of installing them.
.It Ev SCRIPTDIR
Location for scripts related to the current port (default: scripts.${ARCH}
or scripts).
.It Ev SEPARATE_BUILD
Many gnu configure ports can be built in a directory distinct from the
place they were unpacked. 
Set to 
.Sq simple 
if this is the case. 
The ports infrastructure will generate a separate ${WRKBUILD} directory 
in which the port will be configured and built. 
Wipe ${WRKBUILD} to start anew, but skipping the extract/patch stage.
Set to
.Sq concurrent
if the build process does not modify anything under ${WRKSRC}.
The build process can then be run concurrently on different architectures.
Set to
.Sq flavored
if distinct flavors of the port may share a common source tree.
.It Ev SUBPACKAGE
Set to the sub package suffix when building a package in a multi-package
port. Read-only. Used to test for dependencies or to adjust the package
name.
.It Ev SYSCONFDIR
Location for ports system configuration files. Defaults to /etc, should
never be set to /usr/local/etc.
.It Ev TEMPLATES
Base location for the templates used in the readme target.
.It Ev WRKDIR
Location where all port activity occurs.  Apart from the actual port, may
hold all kinds of cookies that checkpoint the port's build.  Read-only.
Ports that need to know the WRKDIR of another port must use
cd that_port_dir && make show VARNAME=WRKDIR  for this.
Note that WRKDIR may be a symbolic link. 
.It Ev WRKDIST
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the source normally unpacked. Base for all
patches (default: ${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME}).
Note that WRKDIST may be a symbolic link, if set to ${WRKDIR}.
.It Ev WRKSRC
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the actual source is. Base for
configuration (default: ${WRKDIST})
Note that WRKSRC may be a symbolic link, if set to ${WRKDIR}.
.It Ev WRKBUILD
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the actual build occurs. Defaults to
${WRKSRC}, unless SEPARATE_BUILD is involved, in which case it is set
to an appropriate value.
.It Ev WRKINST
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where port normally installs (see 
.Ar fake 
target).
.It Ev WRKOBJDIR
If defined, used as a base for the actual port working directory. The real
working directory is created there, and the port ${WRKDIR} is just a link.
.It Ev X11BASE
Where X11 has been installed (default: /usr/X11R6).
.It Ev USE_GMAKE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if gnu make (${GMAKE}) is needed for correct behavior of this port.
.It Ev USE_LIBTOOL
Set to
.Sq Yes
if libtool is required for correct behavior of this port.
Add correct dependencies, and passes LIBTOOL environment variable to
scripts invocations.
.It Ev USE_MOTIF
Set to
.Sq Yes
if lesstif is needed for correct behavior of this port.
.It Ev XMKMF
Invocation of xmkmf for CONFIGURE_STYLE=imake port. Defaults to 
xmkf -a -DPorts.  The -DPorts is specific to
.Ox
and is always appended.

.Sh OBSOLETE TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width do-configure
.It Ar {pre,do}-extract
Don't override. Set 
.Ev EXTRACT_ONLY
to nothing and override 
.Ar post-extract instead.
.It Ar fetch-list
Use the more powerful mirror-maker and fetch-makefile targets instead.
.El
.Sh OBSOLETE VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev GNU_CONFIGURE
Use 
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
instead.
.It Ev HAS_CONFIGURE
Use
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE 
instead.
.It Ev MD5_FILE
Use
.Ev CHECKSUM_FILE
instead.
.It Ev NO_CONFIGURE
If ${FILESDIR}/configure does not exist, no automatic configuration will
be done anyway.
.It Ev NO_EXTRACT
Set EXTRACT_ONLY=  instead.
.It Ev NO_MTREE
Starting with
.Ox 2.7 ,
the operating system installation script runs the /usr/local specification
globally, instead of embedding it in each package. 
So packages no longer record an
.Xr mtree 1 
specification.  Use an explicit
.Sq @exec
command if needed.
.It Ev NO_PATCH
The absence of a patches directory does the same. Use PATCHDIR and
PATCH_LIST if patches need to be changed dynamically.
.It Ev NO_WRKDIR
All ports should have a working directory, as this is necessary to store
cookies and keep state.
.It Ev NO_WRKSUBDIR
The same functionality is obtained by setting WRKDIST=${WRKDIR} .
.It Ev NOCLEANDEPENDS
Use CLEANDEPENDS instead.
.It Ev NOMANCOMPRESS
.Fx
ships with compressed man pages, and uses this variable to control
that behavior.
.It Ev PATCH_SITES
.Ev PATCH_FILES 
used to be retrieved from a separate site list. For greater flexibility,
all files are now retrieved from 
.Ev MASTER_SITES ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES0 ,...
.Ev MASTER_SITES9 ,
using a 
.Sq :0

.It Pa ${FILESDIR}/md5
Checksum file. Holds the output of 
.Xr md5 1 ,
.Xr sha1 1 
and
.Xr rmd160 1
for the ports ${DISTFILES} and ${PATCHFILES}.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/DESCR
Description for the port. Variables such as ${HOMEPAGE} will be expanded
(see SUBST_VARS). Multi-packages ports will use DESCR${SUBPACKAGE}.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/COMMENT
Short, one line description of the port, that is displayed by 
.Xr pkg_info 1 ,
and appears in 
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/INDEX .
Name will be adjusted for flavored and multi-packages ports.
.It Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree

.Ar fake .
Use 
.Ar pre-fake
if this is incomplete.
.El
.Sh OBSOLETE FILES
.Bl -tag -width files/md5
.It Pa ${SCRIPTDIR}/{pre,do,post}-*
Identical functionality can be obtained through a {pre,do,post}-* target,
invoking the script manually if necessary.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/PLIST.noshared
Use PFRAG.shared or PFRAG.no-shared instead.  PLIST.noshared was too easy
to forget when updating ports.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/PLIST.sed
Use PLIST directly. Until revision 1.295,
.Nm
did not substitute variables in the packing list unless this special form
was used.
.It Pa /usr/share/mk/bsd.port.mk
Original location of 
.Nm .
The current file lives under ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/mk/bsd.port.mk,
whereas /usr/share/mk/bsd.port.mk is just a stub.
.It Pa {scripts,files,patches}.${OPSYS}
The 
.Ox
ports tree focuses on robustness, not on being portable to other operating
systems.
.It Pa /usr/local/etc
Used by
.Fx
to marshall system configuration files. All
.Ox
system configuration files are located in /etc, or in a subdirectory of
/etc.
.El
.Sh THE FAKE FRAMEWORK
The
.Ar fake
target is used to install the port in a private directory first, package
that false installation, so that the real installation will use the
package.

Essentially, 
.Ar fake
invokes a real
.Ar install
process after tweaking a few variables.
.Pp
.Ar fake 
first creates a skeleton tree under ${WRKINST}, using the 
.Xr mtree 1
specification
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree .
.Pp
A
.Ar pre-fake
target may be used to complete that skeleton tree. For instance, a few
ports may  need supplementary stuff to be present (as it would be installed
if the ports' dependencies were present).
.Pp
If {pre,do,post}-install overrides are present, they are used with some 
important changes: PREFIX is set to ${WRKINST}${PREFIX}, DESTDIR is set to
${WRKINST}, and TRUEPREFIX is set to ${PREFIX}.
Essentially, old install targets work transparently, except for a need to
change PREFIX to TRUEPREFIX for symbolic links and similar path lookups.
Specific traditional post install work can be simply removed, as it will
be taken care of by the package itself (for instance, ldconfig, or
texinfo's install-info).
.Pp
If no do-install override is present, the port is installed using
.Bd -litteral -indent offset
    env -i ${MAKE_ENV} 
    PREFIX=${WRKINST}${PREFIX} DESTDIR=${WRKINST} TRUEPREFIX=${PREFIX} 
    ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${FAKE_FLAGS} -f ${MAKE_FILE} ${FAKE_TARGET}
.Ed
Note that this does set both PREFIX and DESTDIR. If a port's Makefile both
heeds DESTDIR, and references PREFIX explicitly, FAKE_FLAGS may rectify
the problem by setting PREFIX=${PREFIX}
(which will do the right thing, since ${PREFIX} is a
.Xr make 1
construct which will not be seen by the shell).
.Pp
${FAKE_FLAGS} is used to set variables on 
.Xr make 1
command line, which will override the port Makefile contents. Thus, a
port that mentions DESTDIR=    does not need any patch to work with fake.
.Pp
Recursive makes are a problem, and will often need FAKE_FLAGS to be changed
to ensure that the right values are passed down to submakes.
.Sh BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
.Ev LOCALBASE ,
.Ev X11BASE
and
.Ev PREFIX
are not heeded consistently. Most of the ports tree will probably fall
apart if one tries to build/use stuff elsewhere.
.Pp
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS 
is automatically both a BUILD_DEPENDS and a RUN_DEPENDS, whereas some
smarter, more intricate mechanism could be designed to minimize dependencies.
.Sh HISTORY
The ports mechanism originally came from
.Fx .
A lot of additions were taken from 
.Nx
over the years.
.Pp
When the file grew too large, Marc Espie cleaned it up to restore some of
its speed and remove a lot of bugs.

.\" Voluntarily undocumented:
.\" AUTOCONF_ENV: probably not needed anyway, should be internal.
