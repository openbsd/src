.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bsd.port.mk
.Nd ports tree master Makefile fragment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <bsd.port.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
holds all the standard routines used by the ports tree.
Some variables and targets are for its internal use only.
The rest is documented here.
.Pp
Other BSD variants, as well as older versions of
.Nm bsd.port.mk ,
include other targets and variables.
Conversion methods are outlined here.
.Pp
This is an incomplete draft; some variables and targets are not yet documented.
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width do-configure
.It Ar build , Ar all
Default target.
Build the port.
Essentially invoke
.Bd -literal
env -i ${MAKE_ENV} ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${MAKE_FLAGS} \\\&\
	-f ${MAKE_FILE} ${ALL_TARGET}
.Ed
.It Ar checkpatch
Debugging version of the
.Ar patch
target that simulates invoking
.Xr patch 1 .
.It Ar configure
Configure the port.
Might be a void operation.
Unless overridden, configure creates the ${WRKBUILD}
directory (see SEPARATE_BUILD), runs ${SCRIPTDIR}/configure if it exists,
and runs whatever configuration methods are recorded in
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE .
.It Ar distpatch
Apply distribution patches only.
.It Ar do-patch
Override for the default behavior of
.Ar patch .
It is usually better to override
.Ar post-patch ,
as
.Ar patch
needs to invoke
.Ar distpatch
directly for historical reasons.
.It Ar extract
Extract the distfiles under
.Pa ${WRKDIST}
(but see
.Ev EXTRACT_ONLY ) .
Refer to
.Ev EXTRACT_CASES
for a complete description.
.It Ar fake
Do a fake port installation, that is, simulate the port installation under
${WRKINST}.
Described in a separate section below.
.It Ar fetch
Fetch the distfiles and patchfiles. Each file of the
.Ev DISTFILES
and
.Ev PATCHFILES
lists is retrieved, if necessary, from the list of sites in
.Ev MASTER_SITES ,
with %SUBDIR% substituted with
.Ev MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR .
If a filename ends with a
.Sq :0
to
.Sq :9
extension, it will be retrieved from
.Ev MASTER_SITES0
to
.Ev MASTER_SITES9
instead.
The ports framework uses
.Pa ${DISTDIR}/${DIST_SUBDIR}
(aliased to
.Pa ${FULLDISTDIR} )
to cache the ports distribution files and patch files.
Note that
.Ar fetch
can be invoked by mirroring scripts, in which case it will also
retrieve
.Ev SUPDISTFILES ,
to fill with supplementary distribution files which are not needed for
every configuration.
See
.Ev ALLFILES ,
.Ev CDROM_SITE ,
.Ev DISTDIR ,
.Ev DISTFILES ,
.Ev DIST_SUBDIR ,
.Ev FETCH_SYMLINK_DISTFILES ,
.Ev FULL_DISTDIR ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES0 , ... ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES9 ,
.Ev PATCH_FILES ,
.Ev SUPDISTFILES ,
.Ar refetch .
.It Ar patch
Apply distribution and
.Ox
specific patches. Because of historical accident,
.Ar patch
does not follow the exact same scheme other standard targets do.
Namely,
.Ar patch
invokes
.Ar pre-patch
(if defined),
.Ar do-patch ,
and
.Ar post-patch ,
but the default
.Ar do-patch
target recurses through
.Ar distpatch
So, if the
.Ar do-patch
target is overridden, it should still begin by calling
make distpatch, before applying
.Ox
specific patches.
See
.Ar distpatch
for the distribution patches-specific description.
If
.Pa ${PATCHDIR}
exists, the files described under
.Ev PATCH_LIST
will be applied under
.Ev WRKDIST .
.It Ar refetch
Try grabbing a version of the distfiles with the correct checksum off
the main
.Ox
mirror, if
.Ar fetch
+
.Ar checksum
failed.
.It Ar show
Invoked with VARNAME=name, show the contents of VARNAME.
Mostly used from recursive makes, or to know the contents of another
port's variables without guessing wrong.
.El
.Sh VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev ALLFILES
List of all files that need to be retrieved by
.Ar fetch ,
with master site selection extension removed. Read-only.
.It Ev ALL_TARGET
Target used to build software.
Default is
.Sq all .
Can be set to empty, to yield a package's default target.
.It Ev ARCH
Current machine architecture (read-only).
.It Ev AUTOCONF
Location of the autoconf binary if needed.
Defaults to autoconf (though make autoreconf might be more appropriate).
.It Ev AUTOCONF_DIR
Where to invoke autoconf if ${CONFIGURE_STYLE} includes autoconf.
Defaults to ${WRKSRC}.
.\" AUTOCONF_DIR should probably be a list, and be renamed to AUTOCONF_DIRS ?
.It Ev BSD_INSTALL_{PROGRAM,SCRIPT,DATA,MAN}[_DIR]
Macros passed to make and configure invocations.
Set based on corresponding INSTALL_* variables.
.It Ev BUILD_DEPENDS
List of other ports the current port needs to build correctly.
Each item has the form
.Sq file_to_test::directory[:target] .
The double :: is designed to allow wedging a package specification in the
near future.
.Sq target
defaults to
.Sq install
if it is not specified.
.Sq file_to_test
is checked against the current path for ports (see PORTPATH), or as an absolute
file name.
The special name /nonexistent can be used to force a build
dependency (see the ghostscript port for an example).
.Sq directory
is set relative to ${PORTSDIR}.
Build dependencies are checked at the beginning of the extract stage.
.It Ev BZIP2
Name of the bzip2 binary.
.It Ev CDROM_PACKAGES
Base location where packages suitable for a CDROM (see
PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM) will be placed
(default: ${PORTSDIR}/cdrom-packages/${ARCH})
.It Ev CDROM_SITE
Path to a local database that holds distribution files (usually a CD-Rom
or other similar media), used to retrieve distribution files before going
to the network. Defaults to
.Pa /cdrom/distfiles
if this path exists.
Distribution files are still copied or linked (see
.Ev FETCH_SYMLINK_DISFILES )
into
.Ev DISTDIR
if they are found under CDROM_SITE.
.It Ev CFLAGS
Default flags passed to the compiler for building.
Many ports ignore it.
See also
.Ev COPTS .
.It Ev CHECKSUM_FILE
Location for this port checksums, used at
.Ar checksum
stage.
Defaults to ${FILESDIR}/md5.
.It Ev CLEANDEPENDS
If set to
.Sq Yes
.Sq make clean
will also clean dependencies.
Note that distclean never recurses down to dependencies.
.It Ev COMMENT
File used as a comment for the package, and in the INDEX.
Set to
${PKGDIR}/COMMENT by default (with corrections for multi-packages and flavors).
If COMMENT starts with a dash, this is a literal string instead.
This can be used to leave a stub Makefile for removed ports and have a complete
INDEX entry without needing more files.
.It Ev CONFIGURE_SCRIPT
Set to name of script invoked by
.Ar configure
target, if appropriate.
Should be relative to ${WRKSRC}.
.It Ev CONFIGURE_SHARED
Set to --enable-shared or --disable-shared, depending whether the
architecture supports shared libraries.
Append to CONFIGURE_ARGS, for ports that build dynamic libraries and
whose configure script supports those options.
.It Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
Set to style of configuration that needs to happen.
If
.Sq perl ,
assume
.Xr perl 1
.Xr ExtUtils::MakeMaker 3p
style.
If
.Sq gnu ,
assume
gnu configure style.
Add
.Sq dest
if port does not handle DESTDIR correctly, and needs to be configured to
add DESTDIR to prefixes.
Add
.Sq old
if port is an older autoconf port, that does not recognize --sysconfdir.
Add
.Sq autoconf
if autoconf needs to be rerun first.
If
.Sq imake ,
assume port configures using X11 ports Imakefile framework.
Add
.Sq noman
if port has no man pages the Imakefile should try installing.
If
.Sq simple ,
there is a configure script, but it does not fit the normal gnu configure
conventions.
.It Ev COPTS
Supplementary options appended to ${CFLAGS} for building.
Since most ports ignore the COPTS convention, they are actually told to use
${CFLAGS} ${COPTS} as CFLAGS.
.It Ev DEF_UMASK
Correct value of umask for the port to build and package correctly.
Tested against the actual umask at
.Ar fake
time.
Default is 022.
Don't override.
.It Ev DISTDIR
Directory where all ports distfiles and patchfiles are stashed.
Defaults to
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/distfiles.
Override if distfiles are stored elsewhere. Always use
.Ev FULLDISTDIR
to refer to ports's distfiles location, as it takes an eventual
.Ev DIST_SUBDIR
into account.
.It Ev DISTFILES
The main port distribution files (the actual software source, except
for binary-only ports). Will be retrieved from the MASTER_SITES (see
.Ar fetch ) ,
checksummed and extracted (see
.Ar checksum ,
.Ar extract ) .
normally holds a list of files, possibly with :0
.Ev DISTFILES
normally holds a list of files, possibly with
.Sq 0
to
.Sq 9
appended to select a different
.Ev MASTER_SITES .
See also
.Ev SUPDISTFILES .
.It Ev DISTORIG
Suffix used by
.Ar distpatch
to rename original files.
Defaults to
.Pa .bak.orig .
Distinct from
.Pa .orig
to avoid confusing
.Ar update-patches .
.It Ev DIST_SUBDIR
Optional subdirectory of ${DISTDIR} where the current port's distfiles
and patchfiles will be located.
See target
.Ar fetch.
.It Ev ECHO_MSG
Used to display
.Sq ===> Configuring for foo
and similar informative messages.
Override to turn off, for instance.
.It Ev EXTRACT_CASES
In the normal extraction stage (when
.Ev EXTRACT_ONLY
is not empty), this is the contents of a case statement, used to extract files.
Fragments are automatically appended to extract tar and zip
archives, so that the default case is equivalent to the following shell
fragment:
.Bd -literal -indent
set -e
cd ${WRKDIR}
for archive in ${EXTRACT_ONLY}
do
    case $$archive in
	*.zip)
	  unzip -q ${FULLDISTDIR}/$$archive -d ${WRKDIR};;
	*.tar.bz2)
	  bzip2 -dc ${FULLDISTDIR}/$$archive| tar xf -;;
	*.tar)
	  tar xf ${FULLDISTDIR}/$$archive;;
	*)
	  gzip -dc ${FULLDISTDIR}/$$archive | tar xf -;;
    esac
done
.Ed
.It Ev EXTRACT_ONLY
Set if not all ${DISTFILES} should be extracted at do-extract stage.
Default value is ${DISTFILES}.
.It Ev EXTRACT_SUFX
Used to set DISTFILES default value to ${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX}.
Default value is .tar.gz.
.It Ev FAKE
Automatically set to
.Sq Yes
for most ports (and all new ports).
Indicates that the port, using
.Ev FAKE_FLAGS
magic, will properly fake installation into ${WRKINST}, to be packaged
and properly installed from the package.
Set to
.Sq No
in very rare cases, and during port creation.
.It Ev FAKE_FLAGS
Flags passed to ${MAKE_PROGRAM} on fake invocation.
By default, DESTDIR=${WRKINST}.
If CONFIGURE_STYLE involves gnu, adds AM_MAKEFLAGS='DESTDIR=${WRKINST}' to
take automatic care of recent automaker recursive issues.
.It Ev FETCH_CMD
Command used to fetch distfiles for this port.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/bin/ftp .
No current port overrides the default.
.It Ev FETCH_DEPENDS
See BUILD_DEPENDS for specification.
Fetch dependencies are checked at the beginning of the extract stage.
No current port uses FETCH_DEPENDS.
.It Ev FETCH_SYMLINK_DISTFILES
Set to
.Sq Yes
to link distribution files off
.Ev CDROM_DISTSITE
instead of copying them.
.It Ev FILESDIR
Location of other files related to the current ports.
Holds at least the checksum file, sometimes other files
(default: files.${ARCH} or files).
.It Ev FLAVOR
The port current options.
Set by the user, and tested by the port to activate wanted functionalities.
.It Ev FLAVORS
List of all flavors keywords a port may match.
Used to sort FLAVOR into a canonical order to build the package name,
or to select the packing-list, and as a quick validity check.
.It Ev FTP_PACKAGES
Base location where packages suitable for ftp (see
PERMIT_PACKAGE_FTP) will be placed
(default: ${PORTSDIR}/ftp-packages/${ARCH})
.It Ev GMAKE
Location of the gnu make binary, if needed.
Defaults to gmake.
.It Ev LIB_DEPENDS
Libraries this port depends upon.
Similar to BUILD_DEPENDS, except that
.Sq file_to_test
is replaced by a
.Sq lib_spec
of the form:
.Sq libname.[version.[subversion]] .
See BUGS AND LIMITATIONS as well.
.Pp
On architectures that use dynamic libraries,
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
is also used as a running time dependency, and recorded in the package as
such.
.It Ev FULLDISTDIR
Complete path to directory where ${DISTFILES} and ${PATCHFILES} will be
located, to be used in hand-crafted extraction targets (read-only).
.It Ev INSTALL_{PROGRAM,SCRIPT,DATA,MAN}[_DIR]
Macros to use to install a program, a script, a man page, or data (or the
corresponding directory, respectively).
.It Ev INSTALL_TARGET
Target invoked to install the software, during fake installation.
Default is
.Sq install .
.It Ev IS_INTERACTIVE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if port needs human interaction to build.
Usually implies NO_PACKAGE as well.
Porters should strive to minimize IS_INTERACTIVE ports, by using
FLAVORS for multiple choice ports, and by postponing human intervention
to package installation time.
.It Ev LIBTOOL
Location of the libtool binary for ports that set
.Ev USE_LIBTOOL
(default: ${LOCALBASE}/bin/libtool).
.It Ev LIBTOOL_FLAGS
Arguments to pass to libtool.
If USE_LIBTOOL is set, the environment variable LIBTOOL is set
to ${LIBTOOL} ${LIBTOOL_FLAGS}.
.It Ev LOCALBASE
where other ports have already been installed (default: /usr/local)
.It Ev MAINTAINER
E-mail address of the port's maintainer.
Defaults to ports@openbsd.org.
.It Ev MAKE_ENV
Environment variables passed to make invocations.
Sets at least PATH, PREFIX, LOCALBASE, X11BASE, CFLAGS, TRUEPREFIX, DESTDIR,
and the BSD_INSTALL_* macros.
.It Ev MAKE_FLAGS
Flags used for all make invocations, except for the fake stage, which uses
FAKE_FLAGS.
.It Ev MAKE_FILE
Name of the Makefile used for ports building.
Defaults to Makefile.
Used after changing directory to ${WRKBUILD}.
.It Ev MAKE_PROGRAM
The make program that is used for building the port.
Set to ${MAKE} or ${GMAKE} depending on USE_GMAKE.
Read-only.
.It Ev MESSAGE
File recorded in the package and displayed during installation.
Defaults to ${PKGDIR}/MESSAGE if this file exists.
Leave empty if no message is needed.
.It Ev MTREE_FILE
.Xr mtree 8
specification to check when creating a PLIST with the
.Ar plist
target.
By default,
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree.
.It Ev MULTI_PACKAGES
Set to a list of package extensions for ports that create multiple packages.
See
.Qq Flavors and multi-packages
below.
.Pp
.It Ev NEED_VERSION
Specific revision of
.Nm
needed by this ports tree.
Usually set to the current version of
.Nm
when port was built, and updated by port maintainers when needed.
.It Ev NO_SHARED_LIBS
Set to
.Sq Yes
if platform does not support shared libraries.
To be tested after including
.Nm bsd.port.mk ,
if neither PFRAG.SHARED nor CONFIGURE_SHARED are enough.
.It Ev ONLY_FOR_ARCHS
List of architectures on which this port builds.  Can hold both
processor-specific information (e.g., m68k), and more specific model
information (e.g., amiga).
.It Ev OPSYS
Always
.Ox
(read-only).
.It Ev OPSYS_VER
Revision number of
.Ox
(read-only).
.It Ev PACKAGES
Base location for packages built (default: ${PORTSDIR}/packages/${ARCH}).
.It Ev PATCH
Command to use to apply all patches.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/bin/patch .
.It Ev PATCHDIR
Location for patches applied by patch target (default: patches.${ARCH} or
patches).
.It Ev PATCHFILES
Files to fetch from the master sites like
.Ev DISTFILES ,
but serving a different purpose, as they hold distribution patches that
will be applied at the
.Ar patch
stage. See also
.Ev SUPDISTFILES .
.It Ev PATCH_ARGS
Full list of options used while applying port's patches.
.It Ev PATCH_CHECK_ONLY
Set to Yes by the
.Ar checkpatch
target.
Don't touch unless the default
.Ar checkpatch
target needs to be redefined.
Ideally, user-defined patch subtargets ought to test checkpatch.
In practice, they don't.
.It Ev PATCH_DEBUG
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
the
.Ar patch
stage will output extra debug information.
.It Ev PATCH_DIST_ARGS
Full list of options used while applying distribution patches.
.It Ev PATCH_DIST_STRIP
Patch option used to strip directory levels while applying distribution
patches.
Defaults to -p0 .
.It Ev PATCH_LIST
Wildcard pattern of patches to select under ${PATCHDIR} (default: patch-*).
Note that filenames ending in .orig, or ~ are never applied.
.It Ev PATCH_STRIP
Patch option used to strip directory levels while applying port's patches.
Defaults to -p0 .
.It Ev PORTPATH
Path used by most shell invocations.
Don't override unless really needed.
.It Ev PORTSDIR
Root of the ports tree (default: /usr/ports).
.It Ev PKGDIR
Location for packaging information (packing list, port description, port
short description).
Default: pkg.${ARCH} or pkg.
.It Ev PKGNAME
Name of the created package.
Default is ${DISTNAME} for the main package,
and ${DISTNAME}${SUBPACKAGE} for multi-packages ports.
This is automatically altered to include flavors, so it is unwise to
base other variables on it.
.It Ev PKGPATH
Path to the current port's directory, relative to ${PORTSDIR}.
Read-only.
.It Ev PREFERRED_CIPHERS
List of cryptographic ciphers to use, in order of preference.
Default is
.Sq sha1 rmd160 md5 .
The first cipher that matches in ${CHECKSUM_FILE} is verified.
.It Ev PREFIX
Base directory for the current port installation.
Usually ${LOCALBASE}, though some ports may elect a location under /var,
and some multi-package ports may install under several locations.
.It Ev RUN_DEPENDS
Specification of ports this port needs installed to be functional.
Same format as BUILD_DEPENDS.
The corresponding packages will be built at
.Ar install
stage, and
.Xr pkg_add 1
will take care of installing them.
.It Ev SED_PLIST
Pipeline of commands used to create the actual packing list from the
PLIST template (usually ${PKGDIR}/PLIST).
.Nm
appends to it substitution commands corresponding to the port's
FLAVOR and variables from SUBST_VARS.
${SED_PLIST} is invoked as a pipeline after inserting PFRAG.shared fragments.
.It Ev SCRIPTDIR
Location for scripts related to the current port (default: scripts.${ARCH}
or scripts).
.It Ev SEPARATE_BUILD
Many gnu configure ports can be built in a directory distinct from the
place they were unpacked.
For some specific ports, this is even mandatory.
Set to
.Sq simple
if this is the case.
The ports infrastructure will generate a separate ${WRKBUILD} directory
in which the port will be configured and built.
Wipe ${WRKBUILD} to start anew, but skipping the extract/patch stage.
Set to
.Sq concurrent
if the build process does not modify anything under ${WRKSRC}.
The build process can then be run concurrently on different architectures.
Set to
.Sq flavored
if distinct flavors of the port may share a common source tree.
.It Ev SUBPACKAGE
Set to the sub package suffix when building a package in a multi-package port.
Read-only.
Used to test for dependencies or to adjust the package name.
.It Ev SUBST_VARS
Make variables whole values get substituted to create the actual package
information.
Always holds
.Ev ARCH ,
.Ev HOMEPAGE ,
.Ev PREFIX ,
and
.Ev SYSCONFDIR .
The special construct
.Sq ${FLAVORS}
can be used in the packing-list to specify the current list of dash
separated flavors the port is compiled with (useful for cross-dependencies
in
.Ev MULTI_PACKAGES ) .
Add other
variables as needed.
.It Ev SUPDISTFILES
Supplementary files that need to be retrieved under some specific
circumstances. For instance, a port might need architecture-specific files.
.Ev SUPDISTFILES
should hold a list of all distfiles and patchfiles that are not always
needed, so that a mirror will be able to grab all files, or that
.Ar makesum
will work.
Having an overlap between
.Ev SUPDISTFILES
and
.Ev DISTFILES ,
.Ev PATCHFILES
is admissible, and in fact, expected, as it is much simpler to build
an error-free list of files to retrieve in that way. See
the xanim port for an example.
.It Ev SYSCONFDIR
Location for ports system configuration files.
Defaults to
.Pa /etc ,
should never be set to
.Pa /usr/local/etc .
.It Ev TAR
Name of the tar binary.
.It Ev TEMPLATES
Base location for the templates used in the
.Ar readme
target.
.It Ev UNZIP
Name of the unzip binary.
.It Ev USE_BZIP2
Set to Yes if port needs bzip2 to build properly.
This is automatic if EXTRACT_ONLY holds files matching *.bzip2.
.It Ev USE_ZIP
Set to Yes if port needs zip to build properly.
This is automatic if EXTRACT_ONLY holds files matching *.zip.
.It Ev WRKBUILD
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the actual build occurs.
Defaults to ${WRKSRC}, unless SEPARATE_BUILD is involved, in which case
it is set to an appropriate value.
.It Ev WRKDIR
Location where all port activity occurs.
Apart from the actual port, may
hold all kinds of cookies that checkpoint the port's build.
Read-only.
Ports that need to know the WRKDIR of another port must use
cd that_port_dir && make show VARNAME=WRKDIR for this.
Note that WRKDIR may be a symbolic link.
.It Ev WRKDIST
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the source normally unpacked.
Base for all patches (default: ${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME}).
Note that WRKDIST may be a symbolic link, if set to ${WRKDIR}.
.It Ev WRKSRC
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the actual source is.
Base for configuration (default: ${WRKDIST})
Note that WRKSRC may be a symbolic link, if set to ${WRKDIR}.
.It Ev WRKPKG
Subdirectory of ${WRKBUILD} where package information gets generated.
Defaults to ${WKRBUILD}/pkg, do not override unless
.Sq pkg
conflicts with the port's conventions.
.It Ev WRKINST
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where port normally installs (see
.Ar fake
target).
.It Ev WRKOBJDIR
If defined, used as a base for the actual port working directory.
The real working directory is created there, and the port ${WRKDIR} is
just a link.
.It Ev X11BASE
Where X11 has been installed (default: /usr/X11R6).
.It Ev USE_GMAKE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if gnu make (${GMAKE}) is needed for correct behavior of this port.
.It Ev USE_LIBTOOL
Set to
.Sq Yes
if libtool is required for correct behavior of this port.
Add correct dependencies, and passes LIBTOOL environment variable to
scripts invocations.
.It Ev USE_MOTIF
Set to
.Sq Yes
if lesstif is needed for correct behavior of this port.
.It Ev XMKMF
Invocation of xmkmf for CONFIGURE_STYLE=imake port.
Defaults to xmkf -a -DPorts.
The -DPorts is specific to
.Ox
and is always appended.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width files/md5
.It Pa ../Makefile.inc
Common Makefile fragment for a set of ports, included automatically.
.It Pa /cdrom/distfiles
Default path to a CD-Rom (or other media) full of distribution files.
.It Pa Makefile.${ARCH}
Arch-dependent Makefile fragment, included automatically.
.It Pa ${DISTDIR}
cache of all distribution files.
.It Pa ${FILESDIR}/md5
Checksum file.
Holds the output of

.Xr sha1 1 ,
and
.Xr rmd160 1
for the ports ${DISTFILES} and ${PATCHFILES}.
.It Pa ${FULLDISTDIR}/${ALLFILES}
cache of distribution files for a given port.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/DESCR
Description for the port.
Variables such as ${HOMEPAGE} will be expanded
(see SUBST_VARS).
Multi-package ports will use DESCR${SUBPACKAGE}.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/COMMENT
Short, one line description of the port, that is displayed by
.Xr pkg_info 1 ,
and appears in
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/INDEX .
Name will be adjusted for flavored and multi-packages ports.
.It Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree

the operating system installation script runs the /usr/local specification
globally, instead of embedding it in each package.
So packages no longer record an

The absence of a patches directory does the same.
Use PATCHDIR and PATCH_LIST if patches need to be changed dynamically.

.El
.Sh THE FAKE FRAMEWORK
The
.Ar fake
target is used to install the port in a private directory first, package
that false installation, so that the real installation will use the
package.
.Pp
Essentially,
.Ar fake
invokes a real
.Ar install
process after tweaking a few variables.
.Pp
.Ar fake
first creates a skeleton tree under ${WRKINST}, using the
.Xr mtree 8
specification
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree .
.Pp
A
.Ar pre-fake
target may be used to complete that skeleton tree.
For instance, a few ports may need supplementary stuff to be present (as
it would be installed if the ports' dependencies were present).
.Pp
If {pre,do,post}-install overrides are present, they are used with some
important changes: PREFIX is set to ${WRKINST}${PREFIX}, DESTDIR is set to
${WRKINST}, and TRUEPREFIX is set to ${PREFIX}.
Essentially, old install targets work transparently, except for a need to
change PREFIX to TRUEPREFIX for symbolic links and similar path lookups.
Specific traditional post install work can be simply removed, as it will
be taken care of by the package itself (for instance, ldconfig, or
texinfo's install-info).
.Pp
If no do-install override is present, the port is installed using
.Bd -literal -indent offset
    env -i ${MAKE_ENV}
    PREFIX=${WRKINST}${PREFIX} DESTDIR=${WRKINST} TRUEPREFIX=${PREFIX}
    ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${FAKE_FLAGS} -f ${MAKE_FILE} ${FAKE_TARGET}
.Ed
.Pp
Note that this does set both PREFIX and DESTDIR.
If a port's Makefile both heeds DESTDIR, and references PREFIX explicitly,
FAKE_FLAGS may rectify the problem by setting PREFIX=${PREFIX}
(which will do the right thing, since ${PREFIX} is a
.Xr make 1
construct which will not be seen by the shell).
.Pp
${FAKE_FLAGS} is used to set variables on
.Xr make 1
command line, which will override the port Makefile contents.
Thus, a port that mentions DESTDIR= does not need any patch to work with fake.
.Pp
Recursive makes are a problem, and will often need FAKE_FLAGS to be changed
to ensure that the right values are passed down to submakes.
.Sh FLAVORS AND MULTI_PACKAGES
Starting with
.Ox 2.7 ,
each port can generate several packages through two orthogonal mechanims:
FLAVORS and MULTI_PACKAGES.
.Pp
If a port can be compiled with several options, set FLAVORS to the list of
possible options in the Makefile.
When building the port, set
.Li "FLAVOR='option1 option2...'"
to build a specific flavor of the port.
The Makefile should test the value of FLAVOR as follows:
.Bd -literal
    FLAVOR?=
    .if ${FLAVOR:L:Moption1}
    # what to do if option1
    .endif
    .if ${FLAVOR:L:Moption2}
    # what to do if option2
    .endif
.Ed
.Pp
.Pa bsd.port.mk
takes care of a few details, such as generating a distinct work directory for
each flavor, or adding a dash separated list of options to the package
name.
The order in which FLAVOR is specified does not matter: the generated list,
called the canonical package extension, matches the ordering of FLAVORS.
Also, it is an error to specify an option in FLAVOR that does not appear
in FLAVORS.
.Pp
In recursive package building, flavors can be specified as a comma
separated list after the package directory, e.g., SUBDIR+=vim,no_x11.
This is not yet supported for dependencies.
.Pp
Finally, packing information will use templates with the canonical package
extension if they are available: if FLAVOR='option1 option2' and both
DESCR and DESCR-option1-option2 are available, DESCR-option1-option2 will
be used.
.Pp
If a port can generate several useful packages, set MULTI_PACKAGES
accordingly.
Each extension of a MULTI_PACKAGES name should start with a dash, so that
they cannot be confused with FLAVORS.
MULTI_PACKAGES only affects the actual package building step (and the
describe step, since a MULTI_PACKAGES port will produce several
descriptions).
.Pp
Apart from the main package, created by default, each element of
MULTI_PACKAGES triggers a recursive make package, with SUBPACKAGE set to the
right value.
For instance, if MULTI_PACKAGES=-lib -server,
make package will work as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Run make package SUBPACKAGE=-lib,
.It
Run make package SUBPACKAGE=-server,
.It
Build the main package, by running make package SUBPACKAGE=''
.El
.Pp
The port's Makefile can test the value of SUBPACKAGE to specialize
processing for all sub packages.
All packing information is derived from
templates with SUBPACKAGE appended.
In the preceding example, the packing-list template for pkgname-foo
must be in PLIST-foo.
.Pp
It is currently not possible to have a subpackage depend on the main
package, except by inserting an explicit
.Li "@pkgdep"
command into the packing-list.
.Sh THE GENERATION OF PACKING INFORMATION
Starting after
.Ox 2.7
(around revision 1.300 of bsd.port.mk), all packing information is
generated from templates in ${PKGDIR}.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
If not overriden by the user, determine which set of templates to use,
depending on the current SUBPACKAGE and FLAVOR information.
Set ${PLIST}, ${DESCR}, ${COMMENT}, ${MESSAGE} accordingly.
.It
Detect the existence of ${PKGDIR}/{REQ,INSTALL,DEINSTALL}${SUBPACKAGE}.
Modify PKG_ARGS accordingly, to use the generated files, and add
dependencies to regenerate the files if the templates change.
.It
Generate the actual DESCR, and if needed, MESSAGE, REQ, INSTALL, DEINSTALL
from the templates in ${DESCR}, ${MESSAGE}, ${PKGDIR}/REQ${SUBPACKAGE},
${PKGDIR}/INSTALL${SUBPACKAGE}, ${PKGDIR}/DEINSTALL${SUBPACKAGE}, by
substituting the variables in ${SUBST_VARS}, and by substituting
${FLAVORS} with the canonical flavor extension for this port,
e.g, if FLAVORS=no_map gfx qt2, if FLAVOR=gfx no_map, this is
.Sq -no_map-gfx .
.It
Generate the actual PLIST from the template ${PLIST},
by inserting shared/no-shared fragments, applying a possible user-supplied
pipeline, merging other fragments, applying the same variable
substitutions as other packing information, and finally handling
dynamic libraries macros.
.El
.Pp
Note that ${COMMENT} is currently not substituted, to speed up
.Ar describe
generation.
.Pp
To avoid substitution, variables can be escaped as follows:
.Li "$\e{PREFIX}"
.Pp
Constructs such as the line
.Li "%%SHARED%%"
or
.Li "%%!SHARED%%"
in the packing-list template trigger the inclusion of the
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.shared${SUBPACKAGE}
or
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.no-shared${SUBPACKAGE} .
.br
Similarly, if FLAVORS lists flav1, then the line
.Li "%%flav1%%"
(resp.
.Li "%%!flav1%%" )
will trigger the inclusion of
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.flav1${SUBPACKAGE}
(resp.
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.no-flav1${SUBPACKAGE} )
in the packing-list.
Fragments that cannot be handled by these simple rules
can always be specified in a custom SED_PLIST.
.Pp
The constructs
.Li "DYNLIBDIR(directory)"
and
.Li "NEWDYNLIBDIR(directory)"
should be used in
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.shared${SUBPACKAGE}
to register directories that hold dynamic libraries (see
.Xr ldconfig 8 ).
.Li "NEWDYNLIBDIR"
is meant for directories that will go away when the package is deleted.
.Pp
The special
.Ar plist
target does a fairly good job of automatically generating PLIST-auto and
PFRAG.shared-auto fragments.
.Pp
In MULTI_PACKAGES mode, there must be separate COMMENT, DESCR, and PLIST
templates for each SUBPACKAGE (and optional distinct MESSAGE, REQ, INSTALL,
DEINSTALL files in a similar way).
This contrasts with the FLAVORS
situation, where all these files will automatically default to the
non-flavor version if there is no flavor-specific file around.
.Sh BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
.Ev LOCALBASE ,
.Ev X11BASE
and
.Ev PREFIX
are not heeded consistently.
Most of the ports tree will probably fall
apart if one tries to build/use stuff elsewhere.
.Pp
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
is automatically both a BUILD_DEPENDS and a RUN_DEPENDS, whereas some
smarter, more intricate mechanism could be designed to minimize dependencies.
.Sh HISTORY
The ports mechanism originally came from
.Fx .
A lot of additions were taken from
.Nx
over the years.
.Pp
When the file grew too large, Marc Espie cleaned it up to restore some of
its speed and remove a lot of bugs.
.Pp
FLAVORS, MULTI_PACKAGES and FAKE are
.Ox
improvements.
