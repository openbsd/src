.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bsd.regress.mk
.Nd regression test master Makefile fragment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd .include <bsd.regress.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
holds the standard routines used by the source regression tests.
Some variables and targets are for its internal use only.
The rest are documented here.
.Pp
Since this file also includes
.Nm bsd.prog.mk ,
all of the usual
.Ox
Makefile variables may be used to build the regression
test programs.
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width regress
.It Ar depend
Build any dependencies required to carry out the current set
of regression tests.
.It Ar regress
Executes all of the regression targets defined in the Makefile.
.It Ar run-regress-*
Runs an individual regression test.  If the exit status of the
program indicates an error or timeout, then a failure is logged,
otherwise the test is marked as a success.
.Sh VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width REGRESSLOG
.It Ev REGRESSLOG
Points to the fully-qualified path of a file to which regression
results are appended.  Defaults to /dev/null.
.It Ev REGRESSMAXTIME
Maximum limit of CPU seconds to spend on the regression test.
Exceeding this time will result in a failure being logged.
.It Ev REGRESSROOTTARGETS
Targets for which root access is required to run the test. The
.Ev SUDO
variable is invoked for these targets.  See also
.Ev SUDO .
.It Ev REGRESSSKIPSLOW
Skip over all the regression tests which have been marked as
being 'slow' using the
.Ev REGRESSSLOWTARGETS
variable.
.It Ev REGRESSSLOWTARGETS
Targets which are defined as 'slow'.  All of these tests
can be skipped by setting the 
.Ev REGRESSSKIPSLOW 
variable.
.It Ev REGRESSTARGETS
Targets which are invoked to run the set of regression tests
for this Makefile.  Defaults to 
.Ar run-regress-${PROG} .
.It Ev SUDO
Location of the sudo command, used to switch to root for certain
test targets which require it.
.Sh BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
The build system is unable to distinguish between timeouts due to 
.Ev REGRESSMAXTIME
being exceeded, or a genuine failure occurring.
.Sh HISTORY
The regression system originally came from
.Nx ,
with many tests added by
.Ox 
since.
The current Makefile framework was written by Artur Grabowski
and Marc Espie for 
.Ox 3.1 .
