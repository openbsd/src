.Dt PORT-MODULES 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm port-modules
.Nd format and conventions used in port modules
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Ox
Ports framework is based on a gigantic makefile named
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 .
.Pp
In order to curb unwieldy growth, parts of the framework
that are not always needed have been set apart in optional
files called
.Nm port modules ,
which are retrieved as needed through the
.Ev MODULES
variable of
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 .
.Pp
Some of these modules correspond to basic mechanisms which are not
always needed, such as GNU autoconf, or perl5.
.Pp
Other modules correspond to shortcuts for using some other ports as
dependencies without needing to hardcode too much, such as libiconv or
the qt ports.
.Sh THE MODULES LOOK-UP MECHANISM
The variable
.Ev MODULES
should contain a list of module names.
Some core modules are a single word, all other modules should be
${PKGPATH}.
If the module is
.Pa some/dir/portname ,
the ports framework will look for a file named
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/some/dir/portname/portname.port.mk
and include it.
.Pp
Most modules should conform to this syntax.
The historic practice of having a redirection file directly under
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/mk
is deprecated for new modules.
.Pp
Modules may refer to each other.
The modules mechanism has specific recursion handling such that
adding
.Li MODULES += foo/bar
to a module will work as expected.
.Sh NAMING CONVENTIONS
Since there is no actual scope in makefiles, everything defined within
a module will be global to the ports framework, and thus may interfere
with other ports.
.Pp
As far as possible, all variables and targets belonging to a module named
.Pa some/dir/foo
should be named
.Ev MODFOO_*
and
.Ar modfoo_* .
.Pp
Following the same conventions as
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 ,
internal variables and targets not intended for user consumption should be
named
.Ev _MODFOO_*
and
.Ar _modfoo_* .
.Pp
For instance, if a module wants some value to be available for the rest
of the world, it should define
.Ev MODFOO_VARNAME ,
with a name matching the basic infrastructure as far as possible.
That is, a port that defines specific dependencies will usually
define
.Ev MODFOO_WANTLIB ,
.Ev MODFOO_LIB_DEPENDS ,
and
.Ev MODFOO_RUN_DEPENDS ,
as appropriate.
.Pp
As an exception to the naming mechanism, some ports have several distinct
versions in the ports tree, say
.Pa x11/qt2 ,
.Pa x11/qt3 ,
and
.Pa x11/qt4 .
Instead of using the namespace
.Ev MODQT2* ,
variables will usually drop the version suffix and be simply called
.Ev MODQT_*
so that a port using the module can be switched from version to version
without needing to change everything.
.Pp
It is highly desirable to define names in both namespaces for such ports,
for example to define both
.Ev MODQT3_LIB_DEPENDS
and
.Ev MODQT_LIB_DEPENDS .
Normal client ports will use
.Ev MODQT_LIB_DEPENDS ,
but a port may exceptionally import both modules with
.Li MODULES += x11/qt3 x11/qt4
and differentiate between qt3 and qt4 needs with
.Ev MODQT3_LIB_DEPENDS
and
.Ev MODQT4_LIB_DEPENDS .
See
.Pa print/poppler
for an example.
.Sh OVERRIDING TARGET BEHAVIOR
The main framework contains several hooks that allow ports to override
normal behavior.
This evolved as an ad-hoc framework, where only hooks that turned out
to be needed were added.
If several modules define the same hook, hook behaviors will be
invoked in sequence.
.Bl -tag -width do-configure
.It Ar patch
There is a
.Ar post-patch
hook that can be activated by defining
.Ev MODFOO_post-patch .
It will be run right after
.Ar post-patch
and before
.Ev REORDER_DEPENDENCIES
touches things.
.It Ar configure
The normal
.Ar do-configure
behavior is to invoke all
.Ev MODFOO_configure
contents that are defined in
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE .
By default,
.Ar configure
will do nothing.
Some
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
values, namely perl, gnu, imake, automake, autoconf, and autoupdate
will automatically import the correct module.
User-defined modules must both add to
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
and import the correct module to override behavior.
Contrary to other hooks, module behavior is not invoked in
addition to
.Ar do-configure ,
but as the normal configure process.
If
.Ar do-configure
is overriden, normal hook processing will not happen.
.It Ar fake
There is a
.Ar pre-fake
hook that can be activated by defining
.Ev MODFOO_pre-fake .
This will be invoked right after
.Xr mtree 8 ,
and before the normal
.Ar pre-fake
behavior.
.It Ar install
There is a
.Ar pre-install
hook that can be activated by defining
.Ev MODFOO_pre-install .
It will be run right before installing the package with
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
.El
.Sh OVERRIDING VARIABLE BEHAVIOR
Some variables can be overriden by modules.
Be very cautious, as this can make the module difficult to use,
or interact badly with other modules.
As a rule, always provide the override as:
.Pp
.Dl VARIABLE ?= value
.Pp
and provide a module-specific variable with the same value:
.Pp
.Dl MODFOO_VARIABLE = value .
.Pp
The following variables can be overriden in a relatively safe fashion:
.Ev ALL_TARGET ,
.Ev CONFIGURE_SCRIPT ,
.Ev DESTDIRNAME ,
.Ev DIST_SUBDIR ,
.Ev DISTNAME ,
.Ev DISTFILES ,
.Ev EXTRACT_SUFX ,
.Ev FAKE_FLAGS ,
.Ev FETCH_MANUALLY ,
.Ev HOMEPAGE ,
.Ev IGNORE ,
.Ev IS_INTERACTIVE ,
.Ev LIBTOOL_FLAGS ,
.Ev MAKE_FILE ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES ,
.Ev MULTI_PACKAGES ,
.Ev NO_BUILD ,
.Ev NO_REGRESS ,
.Ev PATCH_LIST ,
.Ev PKG_ARCH ,
.Ev PKGNAME* ,
.Ev PREFIX ,
.Ev REGRESS_TARGET ,
.Ev REGRESS_IS_INTERACTIVE ,
.Ev REORDER_DEPENDENCIES ,
.Ev SEPARATE_BUILD ,
.Ev SHARED_ONLY ,
.Ev USE_GMAKE ,
.Ev USE_LIBTOOL ,
.Ev USE_MOTIF .
.Pp
The following variables can be added to in a relatively safe fashion:
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS ,
.Ev CATEGORIES ,
.Ev CONFIGURE_ARGS ,
.Ev CONFIGURE_ENV ,
.Ev ERRORS ,
.Ev FAKE_FLAGS ,
.Ev FLAVOR ,
.Ev FLAVORS ,
.Ev INSTALL_TARGET ,
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS ,
.Ev MAKE_ENV ,
.Ev MAKE_FLAGS ,
.Ev PKG_ARGS ,
.Ev PSEUDO_FLAVORS ,
.Ev REGRESS_DEPENDS ,
.Ev REORDER_DEPENDENCIES ,
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS ,
.Ev SUBST_VARS ,
.Ev WANTLIB .
.Sh SPECIFIC MODULE INTERACTIONS
Some modules correspond to extra ports that will be used mostly as
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS
or
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS .
Such modules can safely append values directly to the
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS ,
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS ,
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS ,
and
.Ev WANTLIB
variables, as long as they also define module-specific variables for
all runtime dependencies.
.Pp
Simple client ports will use the module directly, and thus inherit extra
build and runtime dependencies.
.Pp
More sophisticated ports can use
.Ev MULTI_PACKAGES
to select specific behavior: build-time dependencies will always be
needed.
Runtime dependencies will be selected on a subpackage basis,
since runtime dependencies such as
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS-sub
do not inherit the default
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
value.
The client port's author must only bear in mind that external modules
may add values to the default
.Ev WANTLIB ,
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS ,
and
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS ,
and thus that it is not safe to inherit from it blindly.
.Pp
Modules are imported during
.Pp
.Dl .include <bsd.port.mk>
.Pp
Thus they can be affected by user choices such as setting a variable
to Yes or No.
Modules may make decisions based on documented
.Ev MODFOO_BEHAVIOR
values.
.Pp
When modules are processed, only a few
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5
variables are already defined.
Modules may depend upon the following variables already having a sane
value:
.Ev ARCH ,
.Ev DISTDIR ,
.Ev LOCALBASE ,
.Ev LP64_ARCHS ,
.Ev NO_DEPENDS ,
.Ev NO_SHARED_ARCHS ,
.Ev NO_SHARED_LIBS ,
.Ev PKGPATH ,
.Ev PORTSDIR ,
.Ev USE_X11 ,
.Ev X11BASE .
Note that this is only relevant for tests.
It is perfectly okay to define variables or targets that depend on the
basic ports framework without having to care whether that variable is
already defined, since
.Xr make 1
performs lazy evaluation.
.Sh CORE MODULES DOCUMENTATION
The following modules are available.
.Bl -tag -width do-configure
.It cpan
For perl ports coming from CPAN.
Wrapper around the normal perl module that fetches the file from
the correct location depending on DISTNAME, and sets a default
PKGNAME.
Also affects REGRESS_DEPENDS, CONFIGURE_STYLE, PKG_ARCH, and CATEGORIES.
.Pp
Some CPAN modules are only indexed by author, set CPAN_AUTHOR=ID
to locate the right directory.
.Pp
User settings: set CPAN_REPORT to Yes, CPAN_REPORT_DB to a valid directory,
and CPAN_REPORT_FROM to a valid email adress to automate the reporting
of regress tests to CPAN.
.It gcc3
If USE_GCC3=Yes, and architecture is in MODGCC3_ARCHES, then the gcc 3.3.6
compilers will be put at the front of the path.
.It gcc4
If USE_GCC4=Yes, and architecture is in MODGCC4_ARCHES, then the gcc 4.2
compilers will be put at the front of the path.
.It gnu
This module is documented in the main
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5
manpage.
.It imake
This module is documented in the main
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5
manpage.
.It java
Set MODJAVA_VER=x.y to use exactly the jdk x.y, MODJAVA_VER=x.y+ to
use any x.y or higher version.
Set MODJAVA_JRERUN=Yes if the port only needs the jre at runtime.
The module sets JAVA_HOME, ONLY_FOR_ARCHS, MODJAVA_RUN_DEPENDS, and
appends to BUILD_DEPENDS and RUN_DEPENDS.
It heeds NO_BUILD.
.It lang/ghc
Sets ONLY_FOR_ARCHS, MODGHC_VERSION, BUILD_DEPENDS, and RUN_DEPENDS.
.It lang/ocaml
Sets OCAML_VERSION, MODOCAML_NATIVE.
Appends to BUILD_DEPENDS and MAKE_ENV.
This also selects a %%native%% plist fragment depending on whether
the architecture supports native compilation or not.
.It lang/python
Sets MODPY_VERSION, MODPY_BIN, MODPY_INCDIR, MODPY_LIBDIR, MODPY_SITEPKG,
MODPY_SETUP, MODPY_LIB_DEPENDS, MODPY_RUN_DEPENDS, MODPY_BUILD_DEPENDS.
Adds to RUN_DEPENDS unless MODPY_RUNDEP is set to "no".
MODPY_VERSION is the default version used by all python modules.
Ports which use the setuptools module should set MODPY_SETUPTOOLS to "yes".
Extra arguments to the build and install commands can be passed via
MODPY_DISTUTILS_BUILDARGS and MODPY_DISTUTILS_INSTALLARGS.
Also affects CATEGORIES, MAKE_ENV, SHARED_ONLY, and SUBST_VARS.
May affect regress target.
