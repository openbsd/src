.Dt PYTHON-MODULE 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm python-module
.Nd lang/python port module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the behavior of setting
.Li MODULES=lang/python
in the
.Xr ports 7
tree.
.Pp
By default, the module sets
.Ev MODPY_VERSION
to the appropriate python version
.Po
depending on the existence/presence of a
.Sq python3
.Ev FLAVOR
.Pc .
but
.Ev MODPY_VERSION
may be set manually to ${MODPY_DEFAULT_VERSION_2}
for legacy ports.
.Pp
The module then sets
.Ev MODPY_BIN ,
.Ev MODPY_INCDIR ,
.Ev MODPY_LIBDIR ,
.Ev MODPY_SITEPKG ,
.Ev MODPY_SETUP ,
.Ev MODPY_TEST_DIR ,
.Ev MODPY_TEST_LOCALE ,
.Ev MODPY_WANTLIB ,
.Ev MODPY_LIB_DEPENDS ,
.Ev MODPY_RUN_DEPENDS ,
.Ev MODPY_TEST_DEPENDS ,
.Ev MODPY_BUILD_DEPENDS ,
and
.Ev MODPY_ADJ_FILES
accordingly.
.Pp
The module also appends to
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS
unless
.Ev MODPY_RUNDEP
is set to No,
.It
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS
unless
.Ev MODPY_BUILDDEP
is set to No or
.Ev NO_BUILD
is set to Yes,
.It
.Ev TEST_DEPENDS
if
.Ev MODPY_PYTEST
is set to Yes
unless
.Ev MODPY_TESTDEP
is set to No.
.El
.Pp
It also appends
.Ev MODPY_TEST_LOCALE
to
.Ev TEST_ENV
and changes to the directory specified in
.Ev MODPY_TEST_DIR
.Po
by default ${WRKSRC}
.Pc
before running tests.
.Pp
Ports which use the setuptools module should set
.Ev MODPY_SETUPTOOLS
to Yes.
.Pp
Ports which use the pytest module should set
.Ev MODPY_PYTEST
to Yes.
Arguments can be passed to pytest during
.Cm test
with
.Ev MODPY_PYTEST_ARGS .
.Pp
All ports that generate egg-info files should set
.Ev MODPY_EGG_VERSION
to the version string used by the
.Fn setup
function in the port's
.Pa setup.py .
Arguments can be passed to setup.py during
.Cm configure
with
.Ev MODPY_SETUP_ARGS .
Extra arguments to the build and install commands can be passed via
.Ev MODPY_DISTUTILS_BUILDARGS
and
.Ev MODPY_DISTUTILS_INSTALLARGS .
.Pp
If any files have a python shebang line where the interpreter should be
${MODPY_BIN}, list them in
.Ev MODPY_ADJ_FILES .
These filenames can be relative to ${WRKSRC} and will be modified
at the end of
.Cm pre-configure .
.Pp
This module also affects
.Ev CATEGORIES ,
.Ev MAKE_ENV ,
.Ev CONFIGURE_ENV ,
and
.Ev SUBST_VARS ,
and it may affect the
.Cm test
target.
.Pp
If
.Ev MODPY_PI
is set to
.Sq Yes ,
the module will provide a default for
.Ev HOMEPAGE
and set
.Ev MASTER_SITES
.Po
the subdirectory can be overridden with
.Ev MODPY_PI_DIR
.Pc .
.Ss Packing-list generation
Python 2.x places .pyc files in the same directory as the associated .py file.
Python 3.x places these in a separate __pycache__ directory and uses an
additional suffix.
In some cases, an ABI tag is also used for names of compiled extensions.
The python module defines variables to allow a single
.Pa PLIST
to be
used for both versions:
generate or update the
.Pa PLIST
using the python3
.Ev FLAVOR ,
then edit it to prefix any lines creating
.Ev MODPY_PYCACHE
directories with
.Ev MODPY_COMMENT .
As python2 and python3 packages should permit being installed together,
it may be necessary to suffix names of common binaries or directories,
or split common files into a subpackage.
If updating the PLIST without using the python3 flavor,
take care not to remove ${MODPY_PYCACHE}, ${MODPY_PYC_MAGIC_TAG}, or
${MODPY_ABI_TAG} variables from the PLIST.
