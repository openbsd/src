.Dt MALLOC.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm malloc.conf
.Nd options for the memory allocator
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Upon the first call to the
.Xr malloc 3
family of functions, an initialization sequence inspects the
value of the
.Va vm.malloc_conf
.Xr sysctl 2 ,
next checks the environment for a variable called
.Ev MALLOC_OPTIONS ,
and finally looks at the global variable
.Va malloc_options
in the program.
Each is scanned for the following flags.
Flags are single letters.
Unless otherwise noted uppercase means on, lowercase means off.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm C
.Dq Canaries .
Add canaries at the end of allocations in order to detect
heap overflows.
The canary's content is checked when
.Xr free 3
is called.
If it has been corrupted, the process is aborted.
.It Cm D
.Dq Dump .
.Xr malloc 3
will dump statistics to the file
.Pa ./malloc.out ,
if it already exists,
at exit.
This option requires the library to have been compiled with -DMALLOC_STATS in
order to have any effect.
.It Cm F
.Dq Freecheck .
Enable more extensive double free and use after free detection.
All chunks in the delayed free list will be checked for double frees.
Unused pages on the freelist are read and write protected to
cause a segmentation fault upon access.
.It Cm G
.Dq Guard .
Enable guard pages.
Each page size or larger allocation is followed by a guard page that will
cause a segmentation fault upon any access.
.It Cm J
.Dq More junking .
Increase the junk level by one if it is smaller than 2.
.It Cm j
.Dq Less junking .
Decrease the junk level by one if it is larger than 0.
Junking writes some junk bytes into the area allocated.
Junk is bytes of 0xdb when allocating;
freed chunks are filled with 0xdf.
By default the junk level is 1: after free,
small chunks are completely junked;
for pages the first part is junked.
After a delay,
the filling pattern is validated and the process is aborted if the pattern
was modified.
For junk level 2, junking is done on allocation as well and without size
restrictions.
If the junk level is zero, no junking is performed.
.It Cm R
.Dq realloc .
Always reallocate when
.Xr realloc 3
is called, even if the initial allocation was big enough.
.\".Pp
.\".It Cm U
.\".Dq utrace .
.\"Generate entries for
.\".Xr ktrace 1
.\"for all operations.
.\"Consult the source for this one.
.It Cm S
Enable all options suitable for security auditing.
.It Cm U
.Dq Free unmap .
Enable use after free protection for larger allocations.
Unused pages on the freelist are read and write protected to
cause a segmentation fault upon access.
.It Cm X
.Dq xmalloc .
Rather than return failure,
.Xr abort 3
the program with a diagnostic message on stderr.
It is the intention that this option be set at compile time by
including in the source:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
extern char *malloc_options;
malloc_options = "X";
.Ed
.Pp
Note that this will cause code that is supposed to handle
out-of-memory conditions gracefully to abort instead.
.It Cm <
.Dq Halve the cache size .
Decrease the size of the free page cache by a factor of two.
.It Cm >
.Dq Double the cache size .
Increase the size of the free page cache by a factor of two.
.El
.Pp
If a program changes behavior if any of these options (except
.Cm X )
are used,
it is buggy.
.Pp
The default number of free pages cached is 64 per malloc pool.
Multi-threaded programs use multiple pools.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/malloc.conf"
.It Ev MALLOC_OPTIONS
string of option flags
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Set a systemwide reduction of the cache to a quarter of the
default size and use guard pages:
.Pp
.Dl # sysctl vm.malloc_conf='G<<'
