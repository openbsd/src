.Sh NAME
.Nm remote
.Nd remote host description file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The systems known by
.Xr tip 1
and their attributes are stored in an
.Tn ASCII
file which
is structured somewhat like the
.Xr termcap 5
file.
Each line in the file provides a description for a single
.Xr system .
Fields are separated by a colon
.Pq Sq \&: .
Lines ending with a
.Dq \e
character immediately followed by a newline are
continued on the next line.
.Pp
The first entry is the name(s) of the host system.
If there is more
than one name for a system, the names are separated by vertical bars
.Pq Sq \&| .
After the name of the system comes the fields of the description.
A field name followed by an equal sign
.Pq Sq =
indicates a string value follows.
A field name followed by a pound sign
.Pq Sq #
indicates a following numeric value.
.Pp
Entries named
.Dq tip\&*
and
.Dq cu\&*
are used as default entries by
.Xr tip ,
and the
.Xr cu
interface to
.Xr tip ,
as follows.
When
.Xr tip
is invoked with only a phone number, it looks for an entry
of the form
.Dq tip300 ,
where 300 is the baud rate with
which the connection is to be made.
When the
.Xr cu
interface is used, entries of the form
.Dq cu300
are used.
.Sh CAPABILITIES
Capabilities are either strings (str), numbers (num), or boolean
flags (bool).
A string capability is specified by
.Em capability Ns Ar = Ns Em value ;
for example,
.Dq dv=/dev/harris .
A numeric capability is specified by
.Em capability Ns Ar # Ns Em value ;
for example,
.Dq xa#99 .
A boolean capability is specified by simply listing
the capability.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy \&at
(str)
Auto call unit type.
.It Sy \&br
(num)
The baud rate used in establishing
a connection to the remote host.
This is a decimal number.
The default baud rate is 300 baud.
.It Sy \&cm
(str)
An initial connection message to be sent
to the remote host.
For example, if a host is reached through port selector, this
might be set to the appropriate sequence
required to switch to the host.
.It Sy \&cu
(str)
Call unit if making a phone call.
Default is the same as the
.Sy dv
field.
.It Sy \&dc
(bool)
This host is directly connected, and tip should not expect carrier detect
to be high, nor should it exit if carrier detect drops.
.It Sy \&di
(str)
Disconnect message sent to the host when a
disconnect is requested by the user.
.It Sy \&du
(bool)
This host is on a dial-up line.
.It Sy \&dv
(str)
.Tn UNIX
device(s) to open to establish a connection.
If this file refers to a terminal line,
.Xr tip 1
attempts to perform an exclusive open on the device to insure only
one user at a time has access to the port.
.It Sy \&el
(str)
Characters marking an end-of-line.
The default is
.Dv NULL .
.Dq ~
escapes are only
recognized by
.Xr tip
after one of the characters in
.Sy el ,
or after a carriage-return.
.It Sy \&fs
(str)
Frame size for transfers.
The default frame size is equal to
.Dv BUFSIZ .
.It Sy \&hd
(bool)
The host uses half-duplex communication, local
echo should be performed.
.It Sy \&ie
(str)
Input end-of-file marks.
The default is
.Dv NULL .
.It Sy \&oe
(str)
Output end-of-file string.
The default is
.Dv NULL .
When
.Xr tip
is transferring a file, this
string is sent at end-of-file.
.It Sy \&pa
(str)
The type of parity to use when sending data
to the host.
This may be one of
.Dq even ,
.Dq odd ,
.Dq none ,
.Dq zero
(always set bit 8 to zero),
or
.Dq one
(always set bit 8 to 1).
The default is even parity.
.It Sy \&pn
(str)
Telephone number(s) for this host.
If the telephone number field contains
an @ sign,
.Xr tip
searches the file
.Pa /etc/phones
file for a list of telephone numbers (see
.Xr phones 5 ) .
.It Sy \&tc
(str)
Indicates that the list of capabilities is continued
in the named description.
This is used primarily to share common capability information.

feature:
