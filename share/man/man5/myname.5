.Dt MYNAME 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm myname , mygate
.Nd default hostname and gateway
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/myname
.Nm /etc/mygate
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm myname
and
.Nm mygate
files are read by
.Xr netstart 8
at system startup time.
.Pp
.Pa /etc/myname
contains the symbolic name of the host machine.
The file should contain a single line specifying the
fully qualified domain name
.Pq FQDN
of the system
.Pq e.g. host.example.com .
The name must be resolvable, either by matching a hostname specified in
.Pa /etc/hosts
(see
.Xr hosts 5 )
or through DNS
(see
.Xr resolv.conf 5 ) .
The hostname is set via the
.Xr hostname 1
utility at boot time.
See
.Xr hostname 7
for a description of hostname resolution.
.Pp
.Pa /etc/mygate
contains the address of the gateway host, if it exists.
The gateway is added to the routing tables by the
.Xr route 8
utility.
If
.Pa /etc/mygate
does not exist, no default gateway is added to the routing tables.
The file may contain gateway addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks:
in dotted quad notation for v4
.Pq e.g. 192.0.2.0
or in colon notation for v6
.Pq e.g. 2001:1234:5678::1 .
Each address must be specified on a separate line.
If more than one address of a specific family is found,
only the first is used \- all other addresses of that family are ignored.
.Pp
.Pa /etc/mygate
is processed after all interfaces have been configured.
If any
.Xr hostname.if 5
files contain
.Dq dhcp
directives,
.Pa /etc/mygate
will be ignored.
.Pp
Empty lines and lines beginning with
.Sq #
in either file are ignored.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/myname" -compact
.It Pa /etc/myname
Default hostname.
.It Pa /etc/mygate
Default gateway address(es).
