.Dt HOSTNAME.IF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hostname.*
and
.Nm bridgename.*
.Nd interface-specific configuration files
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm hostname.*
and
.Nm bridgename.*
files contain information regarding
the configuration of each network interface.
One file should exist for each interface that is to be configured,
such as
.Pa hostname.fxp0
or
.Pa bridgename.bridge0 .
However, a configuration file is not needed for lo0.
.Pp
The following two formats are valid for
.Nm hostname.*
files.
.Pp
Regular network setup:
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
.Va addr_family Va addr Va netmask Va broadcast_addr Va options
.Li dest Va dest_addr
.Ed
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
inet 10.0.1.12 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.255 media 100baseTX
.Ed
.Pp
The above format has the following field values:
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset xxxx
.It Va addr_family
The address family of the interface, generally
.Dq inet .
.It Va addr
The optional address that belongs to the interface, such as
190.191.192.1.
It is also feasable to use a hostname as specified in
.Pa /etc/hosts .
It is recommended that an address be used instead of symbolic information
which might activate
.Xr resolver 3
library routines.
.Pp
If no address is specified, the
.Va netmask ,
.Va broadcast_addr ,
.Li dest ,
and
.Va dest_addr
options are invalid and will be ignored.
.It Va netmask
The optional network mask for the interface, i.e.,
255.255.255.0.
.It Va broadcast_addr
The optional broadcast address for the interface, i.e.,
190.191.192.255
.It Va options
Optional miscellaneous options to set on the interface, i.e.,
.Dq media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex .
.It Li dest
If the interface needs a destination address address set, this is
the literal text
.Dq dest .
.It Va dest_addr
The destination address to be set on the interface, such as
190.191.192.2.
It is also feasable to use a hostname as specified in
.Pa /etc/hosts .
It is recommended that an address be used instead of symbolic information
which might activate
.Xr resolver 3
library routines.
.El
.Pp
A DHCP-configured network interface setup consists of
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
.Li dhcp Va options
.Ed
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
dhcp media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex
.Ed
.Pp
The above format has the following field values:
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset xxxx
.It Li dhcp
The literal string
.Dq dhcp
if the interface is to be configured using DHCP.
See
.Xr dhclient 8
and
.Xr dhclient.conf 5
for more details.
.It Va options
Optional miscellaneous options to set on the interface, i.e.,
.Dq media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex .
.El
.Pp
.Pp
The final file format only applies to
.Nm bridgename.bridge*
files.
A bridge interface setup consists of
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
.Va brconfig-arguments
.Va brconfig-arguments
\&...
.Ed
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
add fxp0
add ep1
-learn fxp0
#
static fxp0 8:0:20:1e:2f:2b
up    # and finally enable it
.Ed
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset xxxx
.It Va brconfig-arguments
.Xr brconfig 8
is called for each successive line.  Comments starting with # are
permitted.
