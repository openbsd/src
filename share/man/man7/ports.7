.Sh NAME
.Nm ports
.Nd contributed applications
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm OpenBSD Ports Collection
(shamelessly stolen from the FreeBSD Ports Collection) offers a simple way
for users and administrators to install applications.
Each
.Em port
contains any patches necessary to make the original
application source code compile and run on BSD.  Compiling an
application is as simple as typing
.Ic make
in the port directory!  The
.Pa Makefile
automatically fetches the
application source code, either from a local disk or via ftp, unpacks it
on the local system, applies the patches, and compiles it.  If all goes well,
simply type
.Ic sudo make install
to install the application.
.Pp
For more information about using ports, see
.Nm The OpenBSD Ports Mechanism
(http://www.openbsd.org/ports.html).
For information about creating new ports, see
.Nm Building an OpenBSD Port
(http://www.openbsd.org/porting.html).
Other excellent resources are the ports and porting sections of the
FreeBSD Handbook (http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/ports.html and
http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/porting.html) as well as the NetBSD
Package System documentation
(http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/netbsd/Packages.txt).
.Pp
.Sh PORTS MASTER MAKEFILE
The ports master Makefile, normally located in
.Pa /usr/ports/Makefile 
(but see 
.Ev PORTSDIR
below)
offers a few useful targets.
.Bl -tag -width configure
.It Ar index
rebuild the ports complete index,
.Pa /usr/ports/INDEX
.It Ar print-index
display the contents of the index in a user-friendly way.
.It Ar search
invoked with a key, e.g., 
.Ic make search key=foo ,
retrieve information relevant to a given port.
.Sh TARGETS
Individual ports are controlled through a few documented targets.
Some of these targets work recursively through subdirectories, so that
someone can, for examples, install all of the net
ports.  The targets that do this are
.Ar build , checksum , clean , configure , extract , fetch , fetch-list , 
.Ar install , distclean , deinstall, reinstall, mirror-distfiles, obj ,
.Ar list-distfiles 
and
.Ar package .
.Pp
Target names starting with _  are private to the ports infrastructure,
should not be invoked directly, and are liable to change without notice.
.Pp
In the following list, each target will run the preceeding targets
in order automatically.  That is,
.Ar build
will be run
.Pq if necessary
by
.Ar install ,
and so on all the way to
.Ar fetch .
Typical use only runs 
.Ar install
explicitly (if root), or 
.Ar build
(as user), then
.Ar install 
(as root).
.Bl -tag -width configure
.It Ar fetch
Fetch all of the files needed to build this port from the site(s)
listed in
.Ev MASTER_SITES
and
.Ev PATCH_SITES .
See
.Ev FETCH_CMD
and
.Ev MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE .
.It Ar checksum
Verify that the fetched distfile matches the one the port was tested against.
Defining
.Ev NO_CHECKSUM
to
.Dv Yes
will skip this step.
.It Ar depends
Install
.Pq or compile if only compilation is necessary
any dependencies of the current port.  When called by the
.Ar extract, install
or
.Ar fetch
targets, this is run in scattered pieces as
.Ar fetch-depends , lib-depends , build-depends , run-depends , misc-depends .
Defining
.Ev NO_DEPENDS
to 
.Dv Yes
will skip this step.
.It Ar extract
Expand the distfile into a work directory.
.It Ar patch
Apply any patches that are necessary for the port.
.It Ar configure
Configure the port.  Some ports will ask questions during
this stage.  See
.Ev INTERACTIVE
and
.Ev BATCH .
.It Ar build
Build the port.  This is the same as calling the
.Ar all
target.
.It Ar install
Install the port and register it with the package system.  
.El
.Pp
The following targets are not run during the normal install process.
.Bl -tag -width fetch-list
.It Ar fetch-list
Build a script that lists the files needing to be fetched in order to 
build the port.
.It Ar depends-list package-depends
Print an ordered list of all the compile and run dependencies.
.It Ar clean
Remove the expanded source code.  This does not recurse to dependencies unless
.Ev CLEANDEPENDS
is defined to
.Dv Yes .
.It Ar distclean
Remove the port's distfile(s) and perform the
.Ar clean
operation.  This does not recurse to dependencies.
.It Ar reinstall
Use this to restore a port after using
.Xr pkg_delete 1 .
.It Ar package
Make a binary package for the port.  The port will be installed if it
hasn't already been.  The package is a .tgz file that can be used to
install the port on other machines with
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
If the directory specified by
.Ev PACKAGES
does not exist the package will be put into the current directory.
See
.Ev PKGREPOSITORY
and
.Ev PKGFILE .
.El
.Sh PORT VARIABLES
These can be changed in the environment, or in 
.Pa /etc/mk.conf
for persistence.  They can also be set on make's command line, e.g.,
.Ic make VAR_FOO=foo
.Pp
Boolean variables should be set to 
.Dv Yes
instead of simply being defined, for uniformity and future compatibility.
.Pp
Variable names starting with _ are private to the ports infrastructure,
should not be changed by the user, and are liable to change without notice.
.Pp
.Ss NETWORK CONFIGURATION
The variables pertaining to network access have been marshalled into
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/template/network.conf.template .

To customize that setup, copy that file into
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/db/network.conf
and edit it.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev PORTSDIR
Location of the ports tree.  This is
.Pa /usr/ports
on
.\" .Fx
FreeBSD
and
.\" .Ox ,
OpenBSD
and

on
.Nx .
.It Ev DISTDIR
Where to find/put distfiles, normally
.Pa distfiles/
in
.Ev PORTSDIR .
.It Ev PACKAGES
Used only for the
.Ar package
target; the base directory for the packages tree, normally
.Pa packages/
in
.Ev PORTSDIR .
If this directory exists, the package tree will be (partially) constructed.
This directory does not have to exist; if it doesn't, packages will be
placed into the current directory, or define one of
.Bl -tag -width PKGREPOSITORY
.It Ev PKGREPOSITORY
Directory to put the package in.
.It Ev PKGFILE
The full path to the package.
.El

.It Ev MASTER_SITE_FREEBSD
If set to
.Dv Yes , 
go to the master FreeBSD site for all files.
.It Ev MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE
Try going to this site for all files and patches, first.
.It Ev CLEANDEPENDS
If set to 
.Dv Yes ,
let 
.Sq clean 
recurse to dependencies.
.It Ev NOCLEANDEPENDS
If defined, don't let
.Sq clean
recurse to dependencies (deprecated, use 
.Ev CLEANDEPENDS 
instead).
.It Ev FETCH_CMD
Command to use to fetch files.  Normally
.Xr fetch 1 .
.It Ev FORCE_PKG_REGISTER
If set, overwrite any existing package registration on the system.
.It Ev MOTIFLIB

.It Ev INTERACTIVE
If defined, only operate on a port if it requires interaction.
.It Ev BATCH
If defined, only operate on a port if it can be installed 100% automatically.

.Sh AUTHORS
This man page was originated by
David O'Brien.
The FreeBSD ports collection is maintained by Satoshi Asami
and the awesome ports team.  The OpenBSD ports collection has been maintained by
Marco S Hyman in the past. It is currently managed by Christopher Turan,
with much help from Brad Smith
and a host of others found at ports@openbsd.org.
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm The Ports Collection
appeared in FreeBSD 1.0.
.Sh BUGS
Ports documentation is split over four places ---
.Pa /usr/share/mk/bsd.port.mk ,
the
.Dq Ports Collection
section of the FreeBSD handbook, the
.Dq Porting Existing Software
section of the FreeBSD handbook, and
.Xr ports 7 .
OpenBSD adds a few web pages to further confuse the issue.
