.Sh NAME
.Nm boggle
.Nd word search game
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm boggle
.Op Fl bd
.Op Fl s Ar seed
.Op Fl t Ar time
.Op Fl w Ar length
.Op Ar + Ns Op Ar +
.Op Ar boardspec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The object of
.Nm
is to find as many words as possible on the Boggle board within the three
minute time limit.  A Boggle board is a four by four arrangement of Boggle
cubes, each side of each cube displaying a letter of the alphabet or
.Sq qu .
Words are formed by finding a sequence of cubes (letters) that are in the
game's dictionary.  The (N+1)th cube in the word must be horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally adjacent to the Nth cube.  Cubes cannot be reused.
Words consist solely of lower case letters and must be at least 3 letters long.
.Sh OPTIONS
Command line flags can be given to change the rules of the game.
.Bl -tag -width XxXXXXXXXX
.It Ar +
The
.Ar +
flag allows a cube to be used multiple times, but not in succession.
.It Ar ++
The
.Ar ++
flag allows the same cubes to be considered adjacent to itself.
.It Fl s Ar seed
Specify a seed other than the time of day, where
.Ar seed
is the seed.
.It Fl t Ar time
The time limit may be changed from the default 3 minutes, where
.Ar time
is the duration (in seconds) of each game.
.It Fl w Ar length
The minimum word length may be changed from 3 letters, where
.Ar length
is the minimum number of letters to use.
.It Fl b
The
.Fl b
flag puts
.Nm
in batch mode.
.El
.Pp
A starting board position can be specified on the command line by
listing the board left to right and top to bottom.
.Pp
A
.Ar boardspec
must also be given.
The dictionary is read from stdin and a list of words appearing in
.Ar boardspec
is printed to stdout.
.Pp
Help is available during play by typing
.Sq ? .
More detailed information on the game is given there.
.Sh BUGS
If there are a great many words in the cube the final display of the words
may scroll off the screen.  (On a 25 line screen about 130 words can be
displayed.)
.Pp
No word can contain a
.Sq q
that is not immediately followed by a
.Sq u .
.Pp
When using the
.Ar +
or
.Ar ++
options the display of words found in the board doesn't indicate reused cubes.
.Sh AUTHOR
Boggle is a trademark of Parker Brothers.
