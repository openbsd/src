.Sh NAME
.Nm rain 
.Op Fl d Ar delay
.Nd animated raindrops display
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /usr/games/rain
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rain Ns 's
display is modeled after the 
.Tn VAX/VMS 
program of the same name.
To obtain the proper effect, either the terminal must be set for 9600 baud
or the
.Nm -d
option must be used to specify a delay, in milliseconds, between each update.  A
reasonable delay is 120; the default is 0.
.Pp
As with all programs that use
.Tn termcap ,
the 
.Ev TERM
environment variable must be set (and exported) to the type of the
terminal being used.
