.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program lets you play backgammon against the computer
or against a `friend'.
All commands only are one letter,
so you don't need to type a carriage return,
except at the end of a move.
The program is mostly self documenting:
a question mark (?) will usually get some help.
If you answer `y' when the program asks if you want the rules,
you will get text explaining the rules of the game,
some hints on strategy,
instruction on how to use the program,
and a tutorial consisting of a practice game against the computer.
A description of how to use the program can be
obtained by answering `y' when it asks if you want instructions.
.Pp
The possible arguments for backgammon
(most are unnecessary but some are very convenient)
consist of:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
don't ask for rules or instructions
.It Fl r
player is red (implies n)
.It Fl w
player is white (implies n)
.It Fl b
two players, red and white (implies n)
.It Fl p Ar r
print the board before red's turn
.It Fl p Ar w
print the board before white's turn
.It Fl p Ar b
print the board before any turn
.It Fl t Ar term
terminal is type
.Ar term ,
using /etc/termcap
.It Fl s Ar file
recover previously saved game from
.Ar file .
.El
.Pp
.\" 
An argument of `-h' gets a description of possible arguments.
.Pp
If
.Ar term
has capabilities for direct cursor movement (see
.Xr termcap 5 )
.Nm backgammon
``fixes'' the board after each move,
so the board does not need to be reprinted
unless the screen suffers some horrendous malady.
Also, any `p' option will be ignored.
(The `t' option is not necessary unless the terminal type does not match
the entry in the 
.Pa /etc/termcap 
data base.)
.Sh QUICK REFERENCE

type a space or carriage return to roll, or
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic d

.It Ic r

.It Ic q

.It Ic s
to save the game for later
.El

.It Ic r

.El

or a
.Em move ,
which is a sequence of
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic s-f

.It Ic s/r
