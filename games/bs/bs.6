.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b | s
.Op Fl c
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program allows you to play the familiar Battleships game against the
computer on a 10x10 board.  The interface is visual and largely
self-explanatory; you place your ships and pick your shots by moving the
cursor around the
.Sq sea
with the rogue/hack motion keys
.Em hjklyubn .
.Pp
Note that when selecting a ship to place, you must type the capital letter
(these are, after all, capital ships).  During ship placement, the
.Sq r
command may be used to ignore the current position and randomly place your
currently selected ship.  The
.Sq R
command will place all remaining ships randomly.  The ^L
command (form feed, ASCII 12) will force a screen redraw).
.Sh OPTIONS
The command-line arguments control game modes. 
.Bl -tag -width XxXXX
.It Fl b
Selects a
.Sq blitz
variant.  This allows a side to shoot for as long as it continues to score
hits.
.It Fl s
Selects a
.Sq salvo
variant.  This allows a player one shot per turn for each of his/her
ships still afloat.  This puts a premium on scoring hits early and knocking out
some ships and also makes it much harder, for example, when you face a superior
force with only your PT-boat.
.It Fl c
Permits ships to be placed adjacently.  Normally, ships must be separated by
at least one square of open water.  This disables that check and allows them
to close-pack.
.El
.Sh NOTES
The algorithm the computer uses once it has found a ship to sink is provably
optimal.  The dispersion criterion for the random-fire algorithm may not be.
