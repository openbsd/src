#
# For more information on building in tricky environments, please see
# the list of possible environment variables described in
# /usr/share/mk/bsd.README.
#
# Building recommendations:
#
# 1) If at all possible, put this source tree in /usr/src.  If /usr/src
# must be a symbolic link, setenv BSDSRCDIR to point to the real location.
#
# 2) It is also recommended that you compile with objects outside the
# source tree. To do this, ensure /usr/obj exists or points to some
# area of disk of sufficient size.  Then do "cd /usr/src; make obj".
# This will make a symbolic link called "obj" in each directory, as
# well as populate the /usr/obj properly with directories for the
# objects.
#
# 3) It is strongly recommended that you build and install a new kernel
# before rebuilding your system. Some of the new programs may use new
# functionality or depend on API changes that your old kernel doesn't have.
#
# 4) If you are reasonably sure that things will compile OK, use the
# "make build" target supplied here. Good luck.
#
# 5) If you want to setup a cross-build environment, there is a "cross-tools"
# target available which upon completion of "make TARGET=<target> cross-tools"
# (where <target> is one of the names in the /sys/arch directory) will produce
# a set of compilation tools along with the includes in the /usr/cross/<target>
# directory. The "cross-distrib" target will build cross-tools as well as
# binaries for a given <target>.
