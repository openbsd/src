.Sh NAME
.Nm tftp
.Nd trivial file transfer program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tftp
.Op Ar host Oo Ar port Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the user interface to the Internet
.Tn TFTP
(Trivial File Transfer Protocol),
which allows users to transfer files to and from a remote machine.
The remote
.Ar host
and
.Ar port
may be specified on the command line, in which case
.Nm
uses them as the default for future transfers (see the
.Ic connect
command below).
.Sh COMMANDS
Once
.Nm
is running, it issues the prompt
.Ql tftp\*(Gt
and recognizes the following commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width verbose -compact
.It Ic \&? Ar command-name ...
Print help information.
.Pp
.It Ic ascii
Shorthand for
.Ic mode Ar ascii .
.Pp
.It Ic binary
Shorthand for
.Ic mode Ar binary .
.Pp
.It Ic blksize Ar block-size
Set the block size in bytes for one packet.
The default value is 512 bytes.
Valid values are 8 bytes \(en 65464 bytes.
.Pp
.It Ic connect Ar host Op Ar port
Set the
.Ar host
(and optionally
.Ar port )
for transfers.
Note that the
.Tn TFTP
protocol, unlike the
.Tn FTP
protocol,
does not maintain connections between transfers; thus, the
.Ic connect
command does not actually create a connection,
but merely remembers what host is to be used for transfers.
You do not have to use the
.Ic connect
command; the remote host can be specified as part of the
.Ic get
or
.Ic put
commands.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic get Oo Ar host : Oc Ns
.Ar file Op Ar localname
.Xc
.It Xo
.Ic get Oo Ar host1 : Oc Ns
.Ar file1
.Oo Ar host2 : Oc Ns
.Ar file2 ...
.Oo Ar hostN : Oc Ns
.Ar fileN
.Xc
Get a file or set of files from the remote host.
When using the
.Ar host
argument, the
.Ar host
will be used as the default host for future transfers.
If
.Ar localname
is specified,
the file is stored locally as
.Ar localname ,
otherwise the original filename is used.
.Pp
Note that it is not possible to download two files at the same time;
only one, three, or more than three files
can be downloaded at the same time.
.Pp
.It Ic mode Ar transfer-mode
Set the mode for transfers;
.Ar transfer-mode
may be one of
.Ar ascii
or
.Ar binary .
The default is
.Ar ascii .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic put Ar file
.Oo Oo Ar host : Oc Ns
.Ar remotename Oc
.Xc
.It Xo
.Ic put Ar file1 file2 ... fileN
.Oo Oo Ar host : Oc Ns
.Ar remote-directory Oc
.Xc
Put a file or set of files to the remote host.
When using the
.Ar host
argument, the
.Ar host
will be used as the default host for future transfers.
If
.Ar remotename
is specified, the file is stored remotely as
.Ar remotename ,
otherwise the original filename is used.
If the
.Ar remote-directory
argument is used, the remote host is assumed to be a
.Tn UNIX
machine.
.Pp
Note that files may only be written to if they already exist on the
remote host and are publicly writable.
See
.Xr tftpd 8
for further details.
.Pp
.It Ic quit
Exit
.Nm .
An end-of-file also exits.
.Pp
.It Ic rexmt Ar retransmission-timeout
Set the per-packet retransmission timeout, in seconds.
The default value is 5 seconds.
Valid values are 1 second \(en 255 seconds.
.Pp
.It Ic status
Show current status.
.Pp
.It Ic timeout Ar total-transmission-timeout
Set the total transmission timeout, in seconds.
The default value is 25 seconds.
Valid values are 1 second \(en 255 seconds.
.Pp
.It Ic tout
Toggle the
.Ic tout
option.
This option devlivers the retransmission timeout,
which is set by
.Ic rexmt ,
to the server,
so the server uses the same retransmission timeout as the client.
.Pp
.It Ic tsize
Toggle the
.Ic tsize
option.
This option delivers the total size of the file to be transferred.
With this value given, the client or server can decide
whether they are able to accept the file.
.Pp
.It Ic trace
Toggle packet tracing.
.Pp
.It Ic verbose
Toggle verbose mode.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
Because there is no user login or validation within
the
.Tn TFTP
protocol, the remote site will probably have some
sort of file access restrictions in place.
The exact methods are specific to each site and therefore
difficult to document here.
