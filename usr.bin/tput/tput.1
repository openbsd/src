.Sh NAME
.Nm tput
.Nd terminal capability interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tput
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Ar attribute
.Op Ar attribute-args
.Ar ...
.Nm tput
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Fl S
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility makes terminal-dependent information available to users or shell
applications.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T
The terminal name as found in the
.Xr terminfo
database; for example,
.Dq vt100
or
.Dq xterm .
If not specified,
.Nm
retrieves the
.Ev TERM
variable from the environment.
.It Fl S
The
.Ar attributes
are read from stdin instead of the command line.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
outputs a string if the
.Ar attribute
is of type string or a number if it is of type integer.
If the
.Ar attribute
is of type boolean,
.Nm
exits 0 if the terminal has the capability or 1 if it
does not.
Each
.Ar attribute
should be a string defined in either
.Xr terminfo 5
or
.Xr termcap 5 .
.Pp
If the
.Ar attribute
is of type string and takes arguments (e.g., cursor movement,
the
.Xr terminfo
.Dq cup
sequence) the arguments are taken from the command line immediately
following the attribute.
.Pp
The following special attributes are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It clear
Clear the screen (the
.Xr terminfo
.Dq clear
sequence).
.It init
Print the
.Xr terminfo
initialization strings for the specified terminal.
.It longname
Print the descriptive name of the user's terminal type.
.It reset
Reset the terminal (using the
.Xr terminfo
reset sequences).
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The exit value of
.Nm
is based on the last attribute specified.
If the attribute is of type string or of type integer the exit
value is as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width Ds -compact
.It 0
The requested string was written successfully.
.It 2
Usage error.
.It 3
Unknown terminal type.
.It 4
Unknown attribute name.
.It >4
An error occurred.
.El
.Pp
If the attribute is of type boolean,
.Nm
exits with a value of 0 if the terminal has this attribute or
1 if it does not.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width "tput cup 6 11 dch 6" -compact
.It Li "tput clear cup 5 10"
clear the screen and goto line 5 column 10
.Pp
.It Li "tput cup 6 11 dch 6"
goto line 6 column 11 and delete 6 characters
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr terminfo 3 ,
.Xr terminfo 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
can't really distinguish between different types of attributes.
