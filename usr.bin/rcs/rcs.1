.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

files.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "-e usersXX"
.It Fl A Ns Ar oldfile
Append the access list of
.Ar oldfile
to the access list of the RCS files.
.It Fl a Ns Ar users
Add the usernames specified in the comma-separated list
.Ar users
to the access list of the RCS files.
.It Fl b Ns Op Ar rev
Set the default branch to
.Ar rev .
.It Fl c Ns Ar string
Set comment leader to
.Ar string .
.It Fl e Ns Op Ar users
Remove the usernames specified in the comma-separated list
.Ar users
from the access list of the RCS files.
If
.Ar users
is not specified, all users are removed from the access list.
.It Fl h
Display the program's usage and exit.
.It Fl i
Create and initialize a new RCS file.
If the RCS file has no path prefix, try to first create it in the
.Pa ./RCS
subdirectory or, if that fails, in the current directory.
Files created this way contain no revision.
.It Fl k Ns Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode.
.It Fl L
Enable strict locking on the RCS files.
See
.Xr rcsfile 5
for more details on locking.
.It Fl M
Disable mail warnings when breaking a user's lock.
Normally,
.Nm
will send a mail to the lock owner when his lock is removed by a call
to
.Nm
.Fl u .

.It Fl m Ns Ar rev : Ns Ar msg
Replace revision
.Ar rev Ns 's
log message with
.Ar msg .
.It Fl q

.It Fl T
Preserve the modification time of RCS files.
.It Fl t Ar file \*(Ba Ar str
.Sm on
Change the descriptive text.
The descriptive text is taken from the
.Ar file
specified as argument or from the string
.Ar str
given as argument if it is preceded by the
.Sq -
character.
If no argument is used, the descriptive text is taken from standard input
terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing the
.Sq \&.
character by itself.
.It Fl U
Disable strict locking on the RCS files.
See
.Xr rcsfile 5
for more details on locking.
.It Fl V
Print the program's version string and exit.
.It Fl x Ns Ar suffixes
Specifies the suffixes for RCS files.
Suffixes should be separated by the
.Sq /
character.
