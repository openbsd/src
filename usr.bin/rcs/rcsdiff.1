.Nd compare RCS revisions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl x Ns Ar suffixes
.Op Fl z Ns Ar tz
.Op Ar diff_options

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to compare revisions of RCS files,
in much the same way as the
.Xr diff 1
utility.
Differences between two specific revisions can be requested,
as well as differences between the current working file and
the latest revision of the default branch.
.Pp
It is not possible to display differences between entire directories,
or differences between more than two files.
All diffs produced are in the standard diff format,
unless the
.Fl u
option is specified,
which produces unified diffs.
.Pp
.Nm
also supports
keyword substitution \(en
see the
.Xr rcs 1
man page for more information.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Produces a diff with three lines of context.
See
.Xr diff 1
for more information.
.It Fl k Ns Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode.
.It Fl n
Produces a diff in the same format that is used in the RCS files.
.It Fl q
Be quiet about reporting.
.It Fl r Ns Ar rev
Produces a diff with respect to revision
.Ar rev .
This option should be specified twice to generate a diff
between two specific revisions.
If only one revision is specified,
diffing is done between that revision and
the current working file.
.It Fl u
Produces a unified diff with three lines of context.
See
.Xr diff 1
for more information.
.It Fl V
Print RCS's version number.
.It Fl x Ns Ar suffixes
Specifies the suffixes for RCS files.
Suffixes should be separated by the
.Sq /
character.
.It Fl z Ns Ar tz
Specify the date output format.
.It Ar diff_options
Any of the options documented in
.Xr diff 1
may also be specified.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width RCSINIT
.It Ev RCSINIT
If set, this variable should contain a list of space-delimited options that
are prepended to the argument list.
.It Ev TMPDIR
When set, this variable specifies the directory where temporary files
are to be created.
The default is set to
.Pa /tmp .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Compare the latest revision of the default branch with the content of
working file
.Pa foo.c :
.Pp
.Dl $ rcsdiff foo.c
.Pp
Compare revision 1.7 and 1.8 of file
.Pa foo.c
and ignore differences in keyword values:
.Pp
.Dl $ rcsdiff -kk -r1.7 -r1.8 foo.c
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It 0
No differences were found.
.It 1
Differences were found.
.It 2
