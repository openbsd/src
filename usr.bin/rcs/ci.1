.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to check new revisions into RCS files.

The following options are supported:

for check-in date and time.

.It Fl I
Interactive mode.
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode.

The same as

but also immediately checks out the deposited revision and locks it.
This is useful if you wish to continue to edit the working file after check-in.
.It Fl M
Set the modification time of the file to the date of the
retrieved revision.

Specify a log message.
A line beginning with a hash character

is considered a comment and ignored.

Be quiet about reporting.
.It Fl r Op Ar rev
Check in revision
.Ar rev .
However, if
.Ar rev
is not specified the meaning is completely different \- override any
.Fl l
or

options, ensuring the default behaviour of releasing a lock and removing the
working file.
.It Fl s Ar state
Sets the state of the deposited revision to the identifier
.Ar state .
.It Fl u
