.Sh NAME
.Nm asa ,
.Nm fpr
.Nd interpret carriage-control characters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm asa
.Op Ar
.Nm fpr
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads files sequentially, mapping
.Tn FORTRAN
carriage-control characters to line-printer control sequences,
and writes them to the standard output.
.Pp
The first character of each line is interpreted as a carriage-control
character.
Additionally, the following characters are interpreted as shown:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It <space>
Output the rest of the line without change.
.It 0
Output a newline
.Pq Sq \en
character before printing the rest of the line.
.It 1
Output a <formfeed> character before printing the rest of the line.
.It +
The trailing newline
.Pq Sq \en
of the previous line is replaced by a carriage-return
.Pq Sq \er
before printing the rest of the line.
.El
.Pp
Lines beginning with characters other than the above are treated as if they
begin with a space
.Pq Sq \ .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To view a file containing the output of a
.Tn FORTRAN program:
.Pp
.Dl $ asa file
.Pp
To format the output of a
.Tn FORTRAN
program and redirect it to a line-printer.
.Pp
.Dl $ a.out | asa | lpr
