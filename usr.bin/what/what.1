.Nm what
.Op Fl s
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads each
.Ar file
and searches for sequences of either the form
.Sq $
immediately followed by the system name (sysname) as defined by
.Xr uname 3 ,
or the form
.Dq @(#)
as inserted by the source code control system (SCCS).
.Pp
When
.Sq $
followed by the system name is encountered
.Nm
prints the remainder of the string up to a
.Sq $
or any non-printable character.
.Pp
When
.Dq @(#)
is encountered
.Nm
prints the remainder of the string, up to a NUL, newline, double
quote, backslash, or
.Sq >
character.
.Pp
If the
.Fl s
option is specified, only the first occurrence of an identification string in
each file is printed.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with a return value of 0 if any identification strings were found,
or with a return value of 1 otherwise.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
X/Open System Interfaces option of the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
Processing $sysname$ sequences is an
.Ox
extension.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in the SCCS package and was rewritten for
.Bx 4.0
for licensing reasons.
