.Dt WHAT 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm what
.Nd "show what versions of object modules were used to construct a file"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm what
.Op Fl s
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads each
.Ar file
and searches for sequences of either the form
.Sq $
immediately followed by the system name (sysname) as defined by
.Xr uname 3 ,
or the form
.Dq @(#)
as inserted by the source code control system (SCCS).
It prints the remainder
of the string following this marker, up to a NUL, newline, double
quote, backslash, or
.Sq \*(Gt
character.
.Pp
If the
.Fl s
option is specified, only the first occurrence of an identification string in
each file is printed.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits with a return value of 0 if any identification strings were found,
or with a return value of 1 otherwise.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -xpg4
specification.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
As
.Bx
is not licensed to distribute
.Tn SCCS ,
this is a rewrite of the
.Nm
command which is part of
.Tn SCCS .
As such it may not behave exactly the same as that
command does.
