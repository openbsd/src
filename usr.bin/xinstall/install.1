.Dt INSTALL 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm install
.Nd install binaries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm install
.Op Fl bCcdpSs
.Op Fl B Ar suffix
.Op Fl f Ar flags
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Op Fl o Ar owner
.Ar source ... target ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Ar source
file(s) are copied to the
.Ar target
file or directory.
If the
.Ar target
file already exists, it is either renamed to
.Ar file.old
if the
.Fl b
option is given
or overwritten
if permissions allow.
An alternate backup suffix may be specified via the
.Fl B
option's argument.
If the
.Fl d
option is given,
.Ar target
directories are created, and no files are copied.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-B suffix"
.It Fl B Ar suffix
Use
.Ar suffix
as the backup suffix if
.Fl b
is given.
.It Fl b
Backup any existing files before overwriting them by renaming
them to
.Ar file.old .
See
.Fl B
for specifying a different backup suffix.
.It Fl C
Copy the file.
If the target file already exists and the files are the same,
then don't change the modification time of the target.
.It Fl c
Copy the file.
This is actually the default.
The
.Fl c
option is only included for backwards compatibility.
.It Fl d
Create directories.
Missing parent directories are created as required.
This option cannot be used with the
.Fl B , b , C , c ,
.Fl f , p , S ,
or
.Fl s
options.
.It Fl f Ar flags
Specify the target's file
.Ar flags .
(See
.Xr chflags 1
for a list of possible flags and their meanings.)
.It Fl g Ar group
Specify a
.Ar group .
A numeric GID is allowed.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Specify an alternate
.Ar mode .
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod 1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl o Ar owner
Specify an
.Ar owner .
A numeric UID is allowed.
.It Fl p
Preserve the modification time.
Copy the file, as if the
.Fl C
(compare and copy) option is specified,
except if the target file doesn't already exist or is different,
then preserve the modification time of the file.
.It Fl S
Safe copy.
Normally,
.Nm
unlinks an existing target before installing the new file.
With the
.Fl S
flag a temporary file is used and then renamed to be
the target.
The reason this is safer is that if the copy or
rename fails, the existing target is left untouched.
.It Fl s
.Nm
exec's the command
.Pa /usr/bin/strip
to strip binaries so that install can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.
If the environment variable
.Ev STRIP
is set, it is used instead.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
preserves all file flags, with the exception of the
.Dq nodump
flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "STRIP"
.It Ev STRIP
For an alternate
.Xr strip 1
program to run.
Default is
.Pa /usr/bin/strip .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width INS@XXXXXXXXXX -compact
.It Pa INS@XXXXXXXXXX
If either
.Fl S
option is specified, or the
.Fl C
or
.Fl p
option is used in conjunction with the
.Fl s
option, temporary files named INS@XXXXXXXXXX,
where XXXXXXXXXX is decided by
.Xr mkstemp 3 ,
are created in the target directory.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std install
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chflags 1 ,
.Xr chgrp 1 ,
.Xr chmod 1 ,
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr mv 1 ,

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Fl C ,
.Fl p ,
and
.Fl S
flags are non-standard and should not relied upon for portability.
.Pp
Temporary files may be left in the target directory if
.Nm
exits abnormally.
