.Dt INSTALL 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm install
.Nd install binaries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm install
.Op Fl bCcDdFpSs
.Op Fl B Ar suffix
.Op Fl f Ar flags
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Op Fl o Ar owner
.Ar source ... target ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Ar source
file(s) are copied to the
.Ar target
file or directory.
If the
.Ar target
file already exists, it is either renamed to
.Ar file.old
if the
.Fl b
option is given
or overwritten
if permissions allow.
An alternate backup suffix may be specified via the
.Fl B
option's argument.
If the
.Fl d
option is given,
.Ar target
directories are created, and no files are copied.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-B suffix"
.It Fl B Ar suffix
Use
.Ar suffix
as the backup suffix if
.Fl b
is given.
.It Fl b
Backup any existing files before overwriting them by renaming
them to
.Ar file.old .
See
.Fl B
for specifying a different backup suffix.
.It Fl C
Copy the file.
If the target file already exists and the files are the same,
then don't change the modification time of the target.
.It Fl c
Copy the file.
This is actually the default.
The
.Fl c
option is only included for backwards compatibility.
.It Fl D
Create all leading components of the target before installing into it.
.It Fl d
Create directories.
Missing parent directories are created as required.
This option cannot be used with the
.Fl B , b , C , c ,
.Fl f , p ,
or
.Fl s
options.
.It Fl F
Flush the file's contents to disk.
When copying a file, use the
.Xr fsync 2
function to synchronize the installed file's contents with the
on-disk version.
.It Fl f Ar flags
Specify the target's file
.Ar flags .
(See
.Xr chflags 1
for a list of possible flags and their meanings.)
.It Fl g Ar group
Specify a
.Ar group .
A numeric GID is allowed.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Specify an alternate
.Ar mode .
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod 1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl o Ar owner
Specify an
.Ar owner .
A numeric UID is allowed.
.It Fl p
Preserve the modification time.
Copy the file, as if the
.Fl C
(compare and copy) option is specified,
except if the target file doesn't already exist or is different,
then preserve the modification time of the file.
.It Fl S
Safe copy.
This option has no effect and is supported only for compatibility.
When installing a file, a temporary file is created and written first
in the destination directory, then atomically renamed.
This avoids both race conditions and the destruction of existing
files in case of write failures.
.It Fl s
.Nm
exec's the command
.Pa /usr/bin/strip
to strip binaries so that install can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.
If the environment variable
.Ev STRIP
is set, it is used instead.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
preserves all file flags, with the exception of the
.Dq nodump
flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "STRIP"
.It Ev STRIP
For an alternate
.Xr strip 1
program to run.
Default is
.Pa /usr/bin/strip .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width INS@XXXXXXXXXX -compact
.It Pa INS@XXXXXXXXXX
Temporary files created in the target directory by
.Xr mkstemp 3 .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std install
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chflags 1 ,
.Xr chgrp 1 ,
.Xr chmod 1 ,
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr mv 1 ,
.Xr strip 1 ,
.Xr chown 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Fl C ,
.Fl D ,
.Fl F ,
.Fl p ,
and
.Fl S
flags are non-standard and should not be relied upon for portability.
.Pp
Temporary files may be left in the target directory if
.Nm
exits abnormally.
