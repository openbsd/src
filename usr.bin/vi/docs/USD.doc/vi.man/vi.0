DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _V_i  is  a  screen oriented text editor.  _E_x is a line-ori-
       ented text editor.  _E_x and _v_i are different interfaces  to
       the  same  program,  and it is possible to switch back and
       forth during an edit session.  _V_i_e_w is the  equivalent  of
       using the --RR (read-only) option of _v_i.

       This manual page is the one provided with the _n_e_x_/_n_v_i ver-
       sions of the _e_x_/_v_i text editors.  _N_e_x_/_n_v_i are intended  as
       bug-for-bug   compatible  replacements  for  the  original
       Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution  (4BSD)  _e_x  and  _v_i
       programs.   For  the  rest of this manual page, _n_e_x_/_n_v_i is
       used only when it's necessary to distinguish it  from  the
       historic implementations of _e_x_/_v_i.

       This  manual  page  is intended for users already familiar
       with _e_x_/_v_i.  Anyone else should almost  certainly  read  a
       good  tutorial  on the editor before this manual page.  If
       you're in an unfamiliar environment,  and  you  absolutely
       have  to get work done immediately, read the section after
       the options description, entitled ``Fast Startup''.   It's
       probably enough to get you going.

       The following options are available:

       --cc     Execute  ccmmdd  immediately  after  starting the edit
              session.  Particularly useful for initial position-
              ing  in  the  file,  however  ccmmdd is not limited to
              positioning commands.  This  is  the  POSIX  1003.2
              interface   for   the   historic  ``+cmd''  syntax.
              _N_e_x_/_n_v_i supports both the old and new syntax.

       --ee     Start editing in ex mode, as if  the  command  name
              were _e_x.

       --FF     Don't  copy  the entire file when first starting to
              edit.  (The default is to make a copy in case some-
              one  else  modifies  the file during your edit ses-
              sion.)

       --ll     Start editing with the lisp and  showmatch  options
              set.

       --RR     Start  editing in read-only mode, as if the command
              name was _v_i_e_w, or the rreeaaddoonnllyy option was set.

       --rr     Recover the specified files, or, if  no  files  are
              specified,  list the files that could be recovered.
              If no  recoverable  files  by  the  specified  name
              exist,  the  file is edited as if the --rr option had
              not been specified.

       --ss     Enter batch mode; applicable only to _e_x  edit  ses-
              sions.   Batch  mode  is  useful  when  running  _e_x
              scripts.  Prompts, informative messages  and  other
              user  oriented  message  are  turned  off,  and  no
              startup files or environmental variables are  read.
              This is the POSIX 1003.2 interface for the historic
              ``-'' argument.  _N_e_x_/_n_v_i supports both the old  and
              new syntax.

       --tt     Start   editing   at   the   specified  tag.   (See
              _c_t_a_g_s(1)).

       --ww     Set the initial window size to the specified number
              of lines.

       --vv     Start  editing  in  vi mode, as if the command name
              was _v_i or _v_i_e_w.

       Command input for _e_x_/_v_i is read from the  standard  input.
       In  the  _v_i interface, it is an error if standard input is
       not a terminal.  In the _e_x interface, if standard input is
       not  a terminal, _e_x will read commands from it regardless,
       however, the session will be a batch mode session, exactly
       as if the --ss option had been specified.

       _E_x_/_v_i  exits  0 on success, and greater than 0 if an error
       occurs.

FFAASSTT SSTTAARRTTUUPP
       This section will tell you the  minimum  amount  that  you
       need to do simple editing tasks using _v_i.  If you've never
       used any screen editor before, you're likely to have prob-
       lems even with this simple introduction.  In that case you
       should find someone that already knows _v_i  and  have  them
       walk you through this section.

       _V_i is a screen editor.  This means that it takes up almost
       the entire screen, displaying part of  the  file  on  each
       screen  line, except for the last line of the screen.  The
       last line of the screen is used for you to  give  commands
       to _v_i, and for _v_i to give information to you.

       The other fact that you need to understand is that _v_i is a
       modeful editor, i.e. you are either entering text  or  you
       are  executing  commands,  and you have to be in the right
       mode to do one or the other.  You will be in command  mode
       when  you  first start editing a file.  There are commands
       that switch you into input mode.  There is  only  one  key



                           May 18, 1996                         2





VI(1)                                                       VI(1)


       that takes you out of input mode, and that is the <escape>
       key.  (Key names are written using less-than and  greater-
       than  signs, e.g.  <escape> means the ``escape'' key, usu-
       ally labeled ``esc'' on  your  terminal's  keyboard.)   If
       you're  ever  confused  as  to  which mode you're in, keep
       entering the <escape> key until _v_i beeps at you.   (Gener-
       ally,  _v_i  will  beep  at  you if you try and do something
       that's not allowed.  It will also display error messages.)

       To   start   editing   a  file,  enter  the  command  ``vi
       file_name<carriage-return>''.   The  command  you   should
       enter as soon as you start editing is ``:set verbose show-
       mode<carriage-return>''.  This will make the  editor  give
       you verbose error messages and display the current mode at
       the bottom of the screen.

       The commands to move around the file are:

       hh      Move the cursor left one character.

       jj      Move the cursor down one line.

       kk      Move the cursor up one line.

       ll      Move the cursor right one character.

       <<ccuurrssoorr--aarrrroowwss>>
              The cursor arrow keys should work, too.

       //tteexxtt<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
              Search for the string ``text''  in  the  file,  and
              move the cursor to its first character.

       The commands to enter new text are:

       aa      Append new text, _a_f_t_e_r the cursor.

       ii      Insert new text, _b_e_f_o_r_e the cursor.

       oo      Open  a  new  line below the line the cursor is on,
              and start entering text.

       OO      Open a new line above the line the  cursor  is  on,
              and start entering text.

       <<eessccaappee>>
              Once you've entered input mode using the one of the
              aa, ii, OO or oo commands, use <<eessccaappee>> to quit  enter-
              ing text and return to command mode.

       The commands to copy text are:

       yyyy     Copy the line the cursor is on.

VI(1)                                                       VI(1)


       pp      Append the copied line after the line the cursor is
              on.

       The commands to delete text are:

       dddd     Delete the line the cursor is on.

       xx      Delete the character the cursor is on.

       The commands to write the file are:

       ::ww<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
              Write the file back to the file with the name  that
              you  originally  used as an argument on the _v_i com-
              mand line.

       ::ww ffiillee__nnaammee<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
              Write the file back  to  the  file  with  the  name
              ``file_name''.

       The commands to quit editing and exit the editor are:

       ::qq<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
              Quit  editing  and leave vi (if you've modified the
              file, but not saved your changes, _v_i will refuse to
              quit).

       ::qq!!<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
              Quit,  discarding  any  modifications  that you may
              have made.

       One final caution.  Unusual characters can  take  up  more
       than  one column on the screen, and long lines can take up
       more than a single screen line.  The above  commands  work
       on ``physical'' characters and lines, i.e. they affect the
       entire line no matter how many screen lines  it  takes  up
       and the entire character no matter how many screen columns
       it takes up.

       There are a large number of options that may  be  set  (or
       unset)  to  change  the  editor's  behavior.  This section
       describes  the  options,  their  abbreviations  and  their
       default values.

       In each entry below, the first part of the tag line is the
       full name of the option, followed by any equivalent abbre-
       viations.   The  part  in  square  brackets is the default
       value of the option.  Most of  the  options  are  boolean,
       i.e. they are either on or off, and do not have an associ-
       ated value.

       Options apply to both _e_x and _v_i  modes,  unless  otherwise
       specified.

       SIGALRM
              _V_i_/_e_x uses this signal for periodic backups of file
              modifications and to display ``busy'' messages when
              operations are likely to take a long time.

       SIGHUP

       SIGTERM
              If the current buffer has changed since it was last
              written  in  its  entirety,  the editor attempts to
              save the modified file so it can  be  later  recov-
              ered.  See the _v_i_/_e_x Reference manual section enti-
              tled ``Recovery'' for more information.

       SIGINT When an interrupt occurs, the current operation  is
              halted,  and  the  editor  returns  to  the command
              level.  If interrupted during text input, the  text
              already  input  is resolved into the file as if the
              text input had been normally terminated.
