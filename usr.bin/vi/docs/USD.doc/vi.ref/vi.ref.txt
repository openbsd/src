     This document is the reference guide for the 4.4BSD
implementations of nneexx/nnvvii, which are  reimplementations
of the historic Berkeley eexx/vvii editors.

     Bruce  Englar  encouraged  the early development of
the historic eexx/vvii editor.  Peter Kessler  helped  bring
sanity  to  version  2's command layout.  Bill Joy wrote
versions 1 and 2.0 through 2.7, and created  the  frame-
work  that users see in the present editor.  Mark Horton
added macros and other features and made eexx/vvii work on a
large number of terminals and Unix systems.

     NNvvii is originally derived from software contributed
to the University of California, Berkeley by Steve Kirk-
endall, the author of the vvii clone eellvviiss.

     IEEE  Standard  Portable Operating System Interface
for Computer Environments (POSIX) 1003.2  style  Regular
Expression support was done by Henry Spencer.

     The  curses  library  was  originally  done  by Ken
Arnold.  Scrolling and reworking for  nnvvii  was  done  by
Elan Amir.

11..  DDeessccrriippttiioonn

     VVii is a screen oriented text editor.  EExx is a line-ori-
ented text editor.  EExx and vvii are  different  interfaces  to
the  same  program,  and  it  is possible to switch back and
forth during an edit session.  VViieeww  is  the  equivalent  of
using the --RR (read-only) option of vvii.

     This  reference  manual  is  the  one provided with the
nneexx/nnvvii versions of the eexx/vvii  text  editors.   NNeexx/nnvvii  are
intended  as  bug-for-bug  compatible  replacements  for the
original Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution (4BSD)  eexx/vvii
programs.   This reference manual is accompanied by a tradi-
tional-style manual page.  That manual  page  describes  the
functionality  found  in  eexx/vvii  in far less detail than the
description here.  In  addition,  it  describes  the  system
interface  to  eexx/vvii,  e.g.  command  line  options, session
recovery,  signals,  environmental  variables,  and  similar
things.

     This  reference  is intended for users already familiar
with eexx/vvii.  Anyone else should almost certainly read a good
tutorial  on  the editor first.  If you are in an unfamiliar
environment, and you absolutely have to get work done  imme-
diately, see the section entitled "FFaasstt SSttaarrttuupp" in the man-
ual page.  It is probably enough to get you started.

     There are a few features in nneexx/nnvvii that are not  found
in historic versions of eexx/vvii.  Some of the more interesting
of those features are briefly described in the next section,
entitled  "AAddddiittiioonnaall FFeeaattuurreess".  For the rest of this docu-
ment, nneexx/nnvvii is used only when it is necessary  to  distin-
guish it from the historic implementations of eexx/vvii.

     Future  versions  of this software will be periodically
made available by anonymous ftp, and can be  retrieved  from
ftp.cs.berkeley.edu, in the directory ucb/4bsd.

     There  are a few features in nneexx/nnvvii that are not found
in historic versions of eexx/vvii.  Some of the more interesting
of these are as follows:

     NNeexx/nnvvii  will  edit  any format file.  Line lengths are
     limited by available memory, and file sizes are limited
     by  available  disk space.  The vvii text input mode com-
     mand <<ccoonnttrrooll--XX>>  can  insert  any  possible  character
     value into the text.

     The  bbgg command backgrounds the current screen, and the










UUSSDD::1133--44                                   NNvvii//NNeexx RReeffeerreennccee


     ffgg command foregrounds backgrounded screens.  The  ddiiss--
     ppllaayy  command  can  be  used  to  list  the  background
     screens.

CCoommmmaanndd EEddiittiinngg
     You can enter a normal editing window on the  collected
     commands  that  you've entered on the vvii colon command-
     line, and then modify and/or execute the commands.  See
     the cceeddiitt edit option for more information.

DDiissppllaayyss
     The  ddiissppllaayy command can be used to display the current
     buffers, the backgrounded screens, and the tags  stack.

EExxtteennddeedd RReegguullaarr EExxpprreessssiioonnss
     The  eexxtteennddeedd  option  causes Regular Expressions to be
     interpreted as as Extended Regular  Expressions,  (i.e.
     _e_g_r_e_p(1) style Regular Expressions).

FFiillee NNaammee CCoommpplleettiioonn
     It is possible to do file name completion and file name
     displays when entering commands on the  vvii  colon  com-
     mand-line.   See the ffiilleecc option for more information.

IInnffiinniittee uunnddoo
     Changes made during an edit session may be rolled back-
     ward  and  forward.  A ..  command immediately after a uu
     command continues either forward or backward  depending
     on whether the uu command was an undo or a redo.

LLeefftt--rriigghhtt ssccrroolllliinngg
     The lleeffttrriigghhtt option causes nnvvii to do left-right screen
     scrolling, instead of the traditional vvii line wrapping.

MMeessssaaggee CCaattaallooggss
     It  is possible to display informational and error mes-
     sages in different languages by providing a catalog  of
     messages.   See  the  mmssggccaatt  option and the file cata-
     log/README ffoorr mmoorree iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn..

IInnccrreemmeennttiinngg nnuummbbeerrss
     The ## command increments or decrements the number  ref-
     erenced by the cursor.

PPrreevviioouuss ffiillee
     The  pprreevviioouuss  command edits the previous file from the
     argument list.

SSccrriippttiinngg llaanngguuaaggeess
     The ::ppee[[rrll]] ccmmdd, ::ppeerrlldd[[oo]] ccmmdd and ::ttcc[[ll]] ccmmdd  commands
     execute  Perl5  and  Tcl/Tk  commands, respectively, on
     lines from the edit buffer.  See  the  "SSccrriippttiinngg  LLaann--

     information.

SSpplliitt ssccrreeeennss
     The EEddiitt, EExx, NNeexxtt, PPrreevviioouuss, TTaagg  and  VViissuuaall  (in  vvii
     mode)  commands divide the screen into multiple editing
     regions and then perform their normal function in a new
     screen  area.   The <<ccoonnttrrooll--WW>> command rotates between
     the foreground screens.  The rreessiizzee command can be used
     to grow or shrink a particular screen.

TTaagg ssttaacckkss
     Tags  are  now  maintained in a stack.  The <<ccoonnttrrooll--TT>>
     command returns to the previous tag location.  The ttaagg--
     ppoopp  command returns to the most recent tag location by
     default, or, optionally to a specific tag number in the
     tag  stack,  or  the  most  recent tag from a specified
     file.  The ddiissppllaayy command can be used to list the tags
     stack.   The  ttaaggttoopp  command returns to the top of the
     tag stack.

UUssaaggee iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn
     The eexxuussaaggee and vviiuussaaggee commands provide usage informa-
     tion  for all of the eexx and vvii commands by default, or,
     optionally, for a specific command or key.

WWoorrdd sseeaarrcchh
     The <<ccoonnttrrooll--AA>> command searches for  the  word  refer-
     enced by the cursor.

33..  SSttaarrttuupp IInnffoorrmmaattiioonn

     EExx/vvii  interprets  one  of  two  possible environmental
variables and reads up to three of five possible files  dur-
ing  startup.   The variables and files are expected to con-
tain eexx commands, not vvii commands.  In  addition,  they  are
interpreted _b_e_f_o_r_e the file to be edited is read, and there-
fore many eexx commands may not be used.  Generally, any  com-
mand that requires output to the screen or that needs a file
upon which to operate, will cause an error if included in  a
startup file or environmental variable.

     Because  the  eexx  command set supported by nneexx/nnvvii is a
superset of the command set supported by  historical  imple-
mentations  of eexx, nneexx/nnvvii can use the startup files created
for the historical implementations, but the converse may not
be true.

     If  the  --ss (the historic - option) is specified, or if
standard input is redirected from a file, all  environmental
variables and startup files are ignored.

     Otherwise,  startup  files  and environmental variables
are handled in the following order:










UUSSDD::1133--66                                   NNvvii//NNeexx RReeffeerreennccee


 (1)   The file /etc/vi.exrc is read, as long as it is owned
       by root or the effective user ID of the user.

 (2)   The  environmental  variable NEXINIT (or the variable
       EXINIT, if NEXINIT is not set) is interpreted.

 (3)   If neither NEXINIT or EXINIT was set,  and  the  HOME
       environmental  variable is set, the file $HOME/.nexrc
       (or the file $HOME/.exrc, if  $HOME/.nexrc  does  not
       exist)  is  read, as long as the effective user ID of
       the user is root or is the same as the owner  of  the
       file.

       When  the  $HOME  directory  is  being  used for both
       nneexx/nnvvii and an historic implementation  of  eexx/vvii,  a
       possible solution is to put nneexx/nnvvii specific commands
       in the .nexrc ffiillee,, aalloonngg wwiitthh aa ::ssoouurrccee  $$HHOOMMEE//..eexxrrcc

       mmeennttaattiioonnss..

       ous  startup information sources, the file .nexrc ((oorr
       tthhee ffiillee ..eexxrrcc, if .nexrc ddooeess nnoott eexxiisstt)) iiss rreeaadd,, aass

     No startup file is read if it  is  writable  by  anyone
other than its owner.

     It is not an error for any of the startup environmental
variables or files not to exist.

     Once all environmental variables are  interpreted,  and
all  startup  files are read, the first file to be edited is
read in (or a temporary file is created).   Then,  any  com-
mands  specified  using  the  --cc option are executed, in the
context of that file.

44..  RReeccoovveerryy

     There is no recovery  program  for  nneexx/nnvvii,  nor  does
nneexx/nnvvii run setuid.  Recovery files are created readable and
writable by the owner only.   Users  may  recover  any  file
which  they can read, and the superuser may recover any edit
session.

     Edit sessions are backed  by  files  in  the  directory
named     by    the    rreeccddiirr    option    (the    directory
/var/tmp/vi.recover bbyy ddeeffaauulltt)),, aanndd aarree nnaammeedd  ""vvii..XXXXXXXXXXXX"",,

mmaanndd..

     The rreeccddiirr option may be set in either  the  user's  or
system's  startup  information, changing the recovery direc-
tory.  (Note, however, that if a memory based file system is
used as the backup directory, each system reboot will delete
all of the recovery files!   The  same  caution  applies  to
directories such as /tmp wwhhiicchh aarree cclleeaarreedd ooff tthheeiirr ccoonntteennttss

cleared of old files on many systems.)

     The  recovery  directory should be owned by root, or at
least by a pseudo-user.  In addition, if directory  "sticky-
bit"  semantics are available, the directory should have the
sticky-bit set so that files may only be  removed  by  their
owners.   The  recovery  directory  must be read, write, and
executable by any user, i.e. mode 1777.

     If the recovery directory does not  exist,  eexx/vvii  will
attempt  to  create  it.   This  can  result in the recovery
directory being owned by a normal  user,  which  means  that
that  user  will be able to remove other user's recovery and
backup files.  This is annoying, but is not a security issue
as the user cannot otherwise access or modify the files.

     The  recovery file has all of the necessary information
in it to enable the user to recover the  edit  session.   In
addition,  it  has  all  of  the necessary email headers for
_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l(8).  When the system is rebooted, all of the  files

     Finally,  the  owner execute bit is set on backup files

this bit set.  This is due to the method in which the  files
are  created.)  Such files should be deleted when the system

     A simple way to do this cleanup is to insert  the  fol-

     The  size of the screen can be set in a number of ways.
EExx/vvii takes the following steps until  values  are  obtained
for  both  the  number  of rows and number of columns in the
screen.

 (1)   If the environmental variable  LINES  exists,  it  is
       used to specify the number of rows in the screen.

 (2)   If  the  environmental variable COLUMNS exists, it is
       used to specify the number of columns in the  screen.

 (3)   The  TIOCGWINSZ _i_o_c_t_l(2) is attempted on the standard
       error file descriptor.

 (4)   The termcap entry (or  terminfo  entry  on  System  V
       machines)  is  checked  for the "li" entry (rows) and
       the "co" entry (columns).

 (5)   The number of rows is set to 24, and  the  number  of
       columns is set to 80.

     If  a window change size signal (SIGWINCH) is received,
the new  window  size  is  retrieved  using  the  TIOCGWINSZ
_i_o_c_t_l(2) call, and all other information is ignored.

     NNvvii  supports  multiple  screens by dividing the window
into regions.  It also supports stacks of screens by permit-
ting  the  user  to  change the set of screens that are cur-
rently displayed.

     The EEddiitt, EExx, NNeexxtt, PPrreevviioouuss, TTaagg  and  VViissuuaall  (in  vvii
mode) commands divide the current screen into two regions of
approximately equal size and then perform their usual action
in a new screen area.  If the cursor is in the lower half of
the screen, the screen will split up, i.e.  the  new  screen
will  be  above  the old one.  If the cursor is in the upper
half of the screen, the new screen will  be  below  the  old
one.

     When more than one screen is editing a file, changes in
any screen are reflected in all other  screens  editing  the
same  file.  Exiting a screen without saving any changes (or
explicitly discarding them)  is  permitted  until  the  last
screen editing the file is exited, at which time the changes
must be saved or discarded.

     The  rreessiizzee  command  permits  resizing  of  individual
screens.  Screens may be grown, shrunk or set to an absolute
number of rows.

     The ^^WW command is used to switch between screens.  Each
^^WW  moves  to the next lower screen in the window, or to the
first screen in the window if there are no lower screens.

     The bbgg command "backgrounds" the current  screen.   The
screen  disappears from the window, and the rows it occupied
are taken over by a neighboring screen.  It is an  error  to
attempt to background the only screen in the window.

     The  ddiissppllaayy  ssccrreeeennss command displays the names of the
files associated with the current  backgrounded  screens  in
the window.

     The ffgg [[ffiillee]] command "foregrounds" the first screen in
the list of backgrounded screens that is associated with its
argument.   If  no  file  argument  is  specified, the first
screen on the list is foregrounded.  Foregrounding  consists
of backgrounding the current screen, and replacing its space
in the window with the foregrounded screen.

     If the last screen in the window is exited,  and  there
are  backgrounded  screens,  the first screen on the list of

backgrounded screens takes over the window.

     NNvvii supports the historic vvii tag  command  <<ccoonnttrrooll--]]>>,
and  the historic eexx tag command ttaagg.  These commands change
the current file context to a new location, based on  infor-

     In  addition, nnvvii supports the notion of "tags stacks",
using the  <<ccoonnttrrooll--TT>>  command.   The  <<ccoonnttrrooll--TT>>  command
returns  the  user  to  the previous context, i.e., the last
place from which a <<ccoonnttrrooll--]]>> or ttaagg command  was  entered.
These  three  commands provide the basic functionality which
allows you to use vvii to review source code in  a  structured
manner.

     NNvvii  also  provides two other basic eexx commands for tag
support: ttaaggppoopp and ttaaggttoopp.  The ttaaggppoopp command is identical
to  the <<ccoonnttrrooll--TT>> command, with the additional functional-
ity that you may specify that modifications to  the  current
file  are  to  be  discarded.  This cannot be done using the
<<ccoonnttrrooll--TT>> command.  The ttaaggttoopp command discards all of the
contexts that have been pushed onto the tag stack, returning
to the context from which the first <<ccoonnttrrooll--]]>> or ttaagg  com-
mand was entered.

     The  historic _c_t_a_g_s(1) tags file format supports only a
single location per tag, normally the  function  declaration
or  structure  or  string  definition.   More  sophisticated
source code tools often provide multiple locations per  tag,
e.g.,  a  list of the places from which a function is called
or a string definition is used.  An example  of  this  func-
tionality is the System V source code tool, ccssccooppee.

CCssccooppee  creates  a  database  of  information on source code
files, and supports a query language for that information as
described  in  the  _c_s_c_o_p_e(1)  manual page.  NNvvii contains an
interface to the ccssccooppee query language which permits you  to
query  ccssccooppee  and  then sequentially step through the loca-
tions in the sources files which ccssccooppee returns.  There  are
two  nnvvii commands which support this ability to step through
multiple locations.  They are the eexx  commands  ttaaggnneexxtt  and
ttaaggpprreevv.  The ttaaggnneexxtt command moves to the next location for
the current tag.  The ttaaggpprreevv command moves to the  previous
location  for the current tag.  (See the ttaaggnneexxtt and ttaaggpprreevv
command discussion in the eexx commands section of this manual
for  more  information.)  At any time during this sequential
walk, you may use the <<ccoonnttrrooll--]]>>, ttaagg or ccssccooppee commands to










NNvvii//NNeexx RReeffeerreennccee                                  UUSSDD::1133--1133


move  to  a new tag context, and then use the <<ccoonnttrrooll--TT>> or
ttaaggppoopp commands to return and continue stepping through  the
locations  for  this  tag.   This is similar to the previous
model of a simple tag stack, except that each entry  in  the
tag  stack  may  have  more than one file context that is of
interest.

     Although there is  no  widely  distributed  version  of
_c_t_a_g_s(1) that creates tags files with multiple locations per
tag, nnvvii has been written to understand the  obvious  exten-
sion  to  the  historic  tags file format, i.e., more than a
single line in the tags file with the same initial tag name.
If  you  wish  to  extend your ccttaaggss implementation or other
tool with which you build tags files, this extension  should
be simple and will require no changes to nnvvii.

     The  nnvvii  and  ccssccooppee  interface is based on the new eexx
command ccssccooppee, which has five subcommands: aadddd, ffiinndd, hheellpp,
kkiillll  and  rreesseett.  The subcommand ffiinndd itself has eight sub-
commands: cc, dd, ee, ff, gg, ii, ss and tt.

ccss[[ccooppee]] aa[[dddd]] ddiirreeccttoorryy
     The aadddd command attaches to the ccssccooppee database in  the
     specified  directory.   The  directory name is expanded
     using the  standard  filename  expansions.   After  nnvvii
     attaches  to  a  new  database,  all  subsequent ccssccooppee
     queries will be asked of that database.  The result  of
     any  single  query  is the collection of responses from
     all of the databases to the query.

     If the "CSCOPE_DIRS" environmental variable is set when
     nnvvii  is  run,  it is expected to be a <blank>-separated
     list of  directories  containing  ccssccooppee  databases  to
     which the user wishes to attach.

::ccss[[ccooppee]] ff[[iinndd]] cc||dd||ee||ff||gg||ii||ss||tt bbuuffffeerr||ppaatttteerrnn
     The  ffiinndd  command is the ccssccooppee query command for nnvvii.
     For this  command,  nnvvii  queries  all  attached  ccssccooppee

     Regular expressions are used in line addresses, as  the
first part of the eexx ssuubbssttiittuuttee, gglloobbaall, and vv commands, and
in search patterns.

     The regular expressions  supported  by  eexx/vvii  are,  by
default,  the Basic Regular Expressions (BRE's) described in
the IEEE POSIX Standard 1003.2.  The eexxtteennddeedd option  causes
all  regular  expressions  to be interpreted as the Extended
Regular Expressions (ERE's) described by the same  standard.
(See  _r_e___f_o_r_m_a_t(7)  for more information.)  Generally speak-
ing, BRE's are the Regular Expressions found  in  _e_d(1)  and
_g_r_e_p(1),  and  ERE's  are  the  Regular Expressions found in
_e_g_r_e_p(1).











NNvvii//NNeexx RReeffeerreennccee                                  UUSSDD::1133--1155


     The following is not intended to provide a  description
of Regular Expressions.  The information here only describes
strings and characters which have special  meanings  in  the
eexx/vvii  version of RE's, or options which change the meanings
of characters that normally have special meanings in RE's.

 (1)   An empty RE (e.g.  "//" or "??"  is equivalent to the
       last RE used.

 (2)   The construct "\<" matches the beginning of a word.

 (3)   The construct "\>" matches the end of a word.

 (4)   The character "~" matches the replacement part of the
       last ssuubbssttiittuuttee command.

     When the mmaaggiicc option is _n_o_t set, the  only  characters
with  special  meanings are a "^_" _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _a_t _t_h_e _b_e_g_i_n_n_i_n_g
_o_f _a_n _R_E_, _a _"_$" character at the  end  of  an  RE,  and  the
escaping  character  "\_"_.   _T_h_e _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _"_.", "*_"_, _"_[" and
"~_" _a_r_e _t_r_e_a_t_e_d _a_s _o_r_d_i_n_a_r_y _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _u_n_l_e_s_s _p_r_e_c_e_d_e_d _b_y  _a
_"_\";  when preceded by a "\_" _t_h_e_y _r_e_g_a_i_n _t_h_e_i_r _s_p_e_c_i_a_l _m_e_a_n_-
_i_n_g_.

     Replacement strings are the second part of a ssuubbssttiittuuttee
command.

     The  character  "&" (or "\&" if the mmaaggiicc option is _n_o_t
set) in the replacement string stands for the  text  matched
by  the  RE  that  is being replaced.  The character "~_" _(_o_r
_"_\_~" if the mmaaggiicc option is _n_o_t set) stands for the replace-
ment  part  of  the previous ssuubbssttiittuuttee command.  It is only
valid after a ssuubbssttiittuuttee command has been performed.

     The string "\#", where "#" is an integer value  from  1
to  9,  stands for the text matched by the portion of the RE
enclosed in the "#"'th  set  of  escaped  parentheses,  e.g.
"\("  and  "\)".   For example, "s/abc\(.*\)def/\1/" deletes
the strings "abc" and "def" from the matched pattern.

     The strings "\l", "\u", "\L" and "\U" can  be  used  to
modify  the case of elements in the replacement string.  The
string "\l" causes the next character  to  be  converted  to
lowercase;  the  string "\u" behaves similarly, but converts
to uppercase (e.g.  s/abc/\U&/ replaces the string abc  with
ABC).   The  string  "\L" causes characters up to the end of
the string or the next occurrence of  the  strings  "\e"  or
"\E"  to  be converted to lowercase; the string "\U" behaves
similarly, but converts to uppercase.

     If the entire replacement pattern is "%", then the last
replacement pattern is used again.

     The  nnvvii  editor  currently supports two scripting lan-
guages, Tcl/Tk and Perl5.  (Note  that  Perl4  isn't  suffi-
cient,  and  that  the Perl5 must be version 5.002 or later.
See the ) See the "BBuuiillddiinngg NNvvii" section for  more  informa-

     The  scripting language interface is still being worked
on, therefore the following information is  probably  incom-
plete,  probably  wrong in cases, and likely to change.  See
the perl_api and tcl_api source directories for more  infor-
mation.   As a quick reference, the following function calls
are provided for both the Perl and Tcl interfaces.  The Perl
interface  uses a slightly different naming convention, e.g.
``viFindScreen'' is named ``VI:FindScreen''.

     When eexx or vvii are executed, the text of a file is  read
(or  a  temporary  file  is  created),  and then all editing
changes happen within the context of the copy of  the  file.

     All  files  are  locked (using the _f_l_o_c_k(2) or _f_c_n_t_l(2)
interfaces) during the edit session, to avoid  inadvertently
making  modifications  to multiple copies of the file.  If a
lock cannot be obtained for a file because it is  locked  by
another  process,  the  edit session is read-only (as if the
rreeaaddoonnllyy option or the --RR flag had been  specified).   If  a
lock  cannot be obtained for other reasons, the edit session
will continue, but the  file  status  information  (see  the
<<ccoonnttrrooll--GG>> command) will reflect this fact.

     When vvii first starts running, it is in command mode  as
well.   There  are  eleven commands that switch vvii into text
input mode: AA, aa, CC, cc, II, ii, OO, oo, RR, SS  and  ss.   Once  in
input  mode,  entering an <escape> cchhaarraacctteerr eennddss tteexxtt iinnppuutt

     EExx/vvii present three different interfaces to  editing  a
file.  EExx presents a line oriented interface.  VVii presents a
full  screen  display  oriented  interface,  also  known  as
"visual  mode".   In  addition, there is a third mode, "open
mode", which is line oriented, but supports cursor  movement
and  editing  within the displayed line, similarly to visual
mode.  Open mode is not yet implemented in nnvvii.

     The following words have special meanings in  both  the
eexx and vvii command descriptions:

<<iinntteerrrruupptt>>
     The  interrupt  character is used to interrupt the cur-
     rent operation.  Normally <control-C>,, wwhhaatteevveerr cchhaarraacc--

<<lliitteerraall--nneexxtt>>
     The literal next character is used to escape the subse-
     quent character from any special meaning.  This charac-
     ter  is always <control-V>..  IIff tthhee tteerrmmiinnaall iiss nnoott sseett

     used to mean literal next as well.

     One  of  a  number  of named areas for saving copies of
     text.  Commands that change or delete text can save the
     changed  or  deleted  text  into a specific buffer, for
     later use, if the command allows it (i.e. the eexx cchhaannggee
     command  cannot  save  the  changed  text  in  a  named
     buffer).  Buffers are named with  a  single  character,
     preceded  by  a  double quote, e.g.  "<character> iinn vvii

     The unnamed buffer is a text storage area which is used
     by commands that use or operate on  a  buffer  when  no
     buffer is specified by the user.  If the command stores
     text into a buffer, the text is stored into the unnamed
     buffer  even if a buffer is also specified by the user.
     It is not  possible  to  append  text  to  the  unnamed
     buffer.   If  text  is  appended to a named buffer, the
     named buffer contains both the old and new text,  while
     the  unnamed  buffer contains only the new text.  There
     is no way to explicitly reference the unnamed buffer.

     Historically, the contents of the unnamed  buffer  were
     discarded  by  many  different commands, even ones that
     didn't store text into it.  NNeexx/nnvvii never discards  the
     contents  of the unnamed buffer until new text replaces
     them.

     VVii takes up the entire screen  to  display  the  edited
file,  except for the bottom line of the screen.  The bottom
line of the screen is used to enter eexx commands, and for  vvii
error  and  informational messages.  If no other information
is being displayed, the default display can show the current
cursor  row  and cursor column, an indication of whether the
file has been modified, and the current mode of the  editor.
See the rruulleerr and sshhoowwmmooddee options for more information.

     Empty  lines  do not have any special representation on
the screen, but lines on the  screen  that  would  logically
come  after  the  end  of the file are displayed as a single
tilde ("~") character.  To differentiate between empty lines
and  lines consisting of only whitespace characters, use the
lliisstt option.  Historically, implementations of vvii have  also
displayed  some  lines  as single asterisk ("@"")) cchhaarraacctteerrss..

     VVii  is  a  modeful editor, i.e. it has two modes, "com-

     When positioning the cursor to a new line  and  column,
the  type  of movement is defined by the distance to the new
cursor position.  If the new position is close,  the  screen
is scrolled to the new location.  If the new position is far
away, the screen is repainted so that the new position is on
the  screen.  If the screen is scrolled, it is moved a mini-
mal amount, and the cursor line will usually appear  at  the










UUSSDD::1133--2222                    NNvvii//NNeexx RReeffeerreennccee ((VVii CCoommmmaannddss))


top  or  bottom  of the screen.  If the screen is repainted,
the cursor line will appear in the  center  of  the  screen,
unless  the cursor is sufficiently close to the beginning or
end of the file that this isn't possible.  If the  lleeffttrriigghhtt
option  is set, the screen may be scrolled or repainted in a
horizontal direction as well as in a vertical one.

     A major difference between the historical vvii  presenta-
tion  and  nnvvii is in the scrolling and screen oriented posi-
tion commands, <<ccoonnttrrooll--BB>>, <<ccoonnttrrooll--DD>>, <<ccoonnttrrooll--EE>>,  <<ccoonn--
ttrrooll--FF>>,  <<ccoonnttrrooll--UU>>, <<ccoonnttrrooll--YY>>, HH, LL and MM.  In histori-
cal implementations of vvii, these commands acted on  physical
(as  opposed  to  logical, or screen) lines.  For lines that
were sufficiently long  in  relation  to  the  size  of  the
screen,  this  meant  that single line scroll commands might
repaint the entire screen, scrolling or  screen  positioning
commands  might  not change the screen or move the cursor at
all, and some lines simply  could  not  be  displayed,  even
though  vvii would edit the file that contained them.  In nnvvii,
these commands act on logical, i.e. screen lines.   You  are
unlikely  to  notice  any  difference unless you are editing
files with lines significantly longer than a screen width.

     VVii keeps track of the currently "most attractive"  cur-
sor  position.   Each command description (for commands that
alter the current cursor position), specifies if the  cursor
is set to a specific location in the line, or if it is moved
to the "most attractive cursor position".  The latter  means
that the cursor is moved to the cursor position that is hor-
izontally as close as possible to the current  cursor  posi-
tion.   If the current line is shorter than the cursor posi-
tion vvii would select, the cursor is positioned on  the  last
character in the line.  (If the line is empty, the cursor is
positioned on the first column of the line.)  If  a  command
moves  the  cursor  to the most attractive position, it does
not alter the current  cursor  position,  and  a  subsequent
movement will again attempt to move the cursor to that posi-
tion.  Therefore, although a movement to a line shorter than
the currently most attractive position will cause the cursor
to move to the end of that line, a subsequent movement to  a
longer  line  will cause the cursor to move back to the most
attractive position.

     In addition, the $$ command makes the end of  each  line
the  most  attractive cursor position rather than a specific
column.

     Each vvii command described below notes where the  cursor
ends up after it is executed.  This position is described in
terms of characters on the line, i.e.  "the previous charac-
ter",  or,  "the  last  character  in the line".  This is to
avoid needing to continually refer to on what  part  of  the
character the cursor rests.










NNvvii//NNeexx RReeffeerreennccee ((VVii CCoommmmaannddss))                    UUSSDD::1133--2233


     The  following  words  have special meaning for vvii com-
mands.

pprreevviioouuss ccoonntteexxtt
     The position of the cursor  before  the  command  which
     caused  the  last absolute movement was executed.  Each
     vvii command described in the next section that  is  con-
     sidered an absolute movement is so noted.  In addition,
     specifying _a_n_y address to an eexx command  is  considered
     an absolute movement.

mmoottiioonn
     A second vvii command can be used as an optional trailing
     argument to the vvii <<, >>, !!, cc, dd, yy, and (depending  on
     the ttiillddeeoopp option) ~~ commands.  This command indicates
     the end of the region of text that's  affected  by  the
     command.   The motion command may be either the command
     character repeated (in which case it means the  current
     line)  or  a  cursor  movement  command.  In the latter
     case, the region affected by the command  is  from  the
     starting  or stopping cursor position which comes first
     in the file, to  immediately  before  the  starting  or
     stopping cursor position which comes later in the file.
     Commands that operate on lines instead of using  begin-
     ning  and ending cursor positions operate on all of the
     lines that are wholly or partially in the  region.   In
     addition,  some  other  commands  become  line oriented
     depending on where in the text they are used.  The com-
     mand descriptions below note these special cases.

     The following commands may all be used as motion compo-
     nents for vvii commands:


     <control-A>    <control-H>   <control-J>   <control-M>
     <control-N>    <control-P>       <space>             $
               %   '<character>             (             )
               +              ,             -             /
               0              ;             ?             B
               E              F             G             H
               L              M             N             T
               W             [[            ]]             ^
               _   `<character>             b             e
               f              h             j             k
               l              n             t             w
               {              |             }


     The optional count prefix available for some of the  vvii
     commands that take motion commands, or the count prefix
     available for the vvii commands that are used  as  motion
     components,  may  be  included and is _a_l_w_a_y_s considered











UUSSDD::1133--2244                    NNvvii//NNeexx RReeffeerreennccee ((VVii CCoommmmaannddss))


     part of the motion argument.  For example, the commands
     "c2w_" _a_n_d _"_2_c_w" are equivalent, and the region affected
     by the cc command is two words of text.  In addition, if
     the  optional count prefix is specified for both the vvii
     command and its motion component, the effect is  multi-
     plicative  and  is  considered part of the motion argu-
     ment.  For example, the commands "4cw"" aanndd  ""22cc22ww"  are
     equivalent, and the region affected by the cc command is
     four words of text.

ccoouunntt
     A positive number used as an optional argument to  most
     commands, either to give a size or a position (for dis-
     play or movement commands), or as a repeat  count  (for
     commands  that  modify  text).   The  count argument is
     always optional and  defaults  to  1  unless  otherwise
     noted in the command description.

     When  a  vvii  command synopsis shows both a [buffer] aanndd
     [[ccoouunntt]], they may be presented in any order.

wwoorrdd
     Generally, in languages where it is applicable, vvii rec-
     ognizes  two kinds of words.  First, a sequence of let-
     ters, digits and underscores, delimited  at  both  ends
     by:  characters  other  than letters, digits, or under-
     scores, the beginning or end of a line, and the  begin-
     ning or end of the file.  Second, a sequence of charac-
     ters  other  than  letters,  digits,  underscores,   or
     whitespace  characters,  delimited  at  both ends by: a
     letter, digit, underscore, or whitespace character, the
     beginning or end of a line, and the beginning or end of
     the file.  For example, the characters  "  !@#abc$%^  ""
     ccoonnttaaiinn tthhrreeee wwoorrddss:: ""!!@@##", "abc"" aanndd ""$$%%^^".

     Groups of empty lines (or lines containing only whites-
     pace characters) are treated as a single word.

bbiiggwwoorrdd
     A set of non-whitespace characters  preceded  and  fol-
     lowed  by whitespace characters or the beginning or end
     of the file or line.  For  example,  the  characters  "
     !@#abc$%^ "" ccoonnttaaiinn oonnee bbiiggwwoorrdd:: ""!!@@##aabbcc$$%%^^".

     Groups of empty lines (or lines containing only whites-
     pace characters) are treated as a single bigword.

ppaarraaggrraapphh
     An area of text that begins with either  the  beginning
     of  a  file,  an empty line, or a section boundary, and
     continues until either an empty line, section boundary,
     or the end of the file.

     with  the  leading  character  on  the last line of the
     screen for a string.  It then searches forward or back-
     ward in the file for the next occurrence of the string,
     which is interpreted as a Basic Regular Expression.

     The // and ??  commands are absolute movements.  They may
     be  used as the motion components of other vvii commands,
     in which case any text copied into a buffer is  charac-
     ter  oriented,  unless  the search started and ended on
     the first column of a line, in which case  it  is  line
     oriented.   In addition, forward searches ending at the
     first character of a line, and backward searches begin-
     ning  at the first character in the line, are corrected
     to begin or end at the last character of  the  previous
     line.   (Note,  forward and backward searches can occur
     for both // and ??  commands, if the wwrraappssccaann  option  is
     set.)

     If an offset from the matched line is specified (i.e. a
     trailing "/"" oorr ""??"  character is followed by a  signed
     offset),  the buffer will always be line oriented (e.g.

          The  following  section  describes  the   commands
     available in the text input mode of the vvii editor.

          Historically,  vvii  implementations  only permitted
     the characters inserted  on  the  current  line  to  be
     erased.   In addition, only the <control-D> eerraassee cchhaarr--

     This  implementation  permits  erasure to continue past
     the beginning of the current line, and  back  to  where
     text  input  mode was entered.  In addition, autoindent
     characters may be erased using the standard erase char-
     acters.  For the line and word erase characters, reach-
     ing the autoindent characters forms a "soft"  boundary,
     denoting  the  end  of  the current word or line erase.
     Repeating the word or line erase  key  will  erase  the
     autoindent characters.

          Historically, vvii always used <control-H> aanndd <<ccoonn--
     ttrrooll--WW>> as character and word erase characters, respec-
     tively,  regardless  of  the current terminal settings.
     This implementation accepts, in addition to  these  two
     characters,  the  current terminal characters for those
     operations.

     <<nnuull>>
          If the first character of the input  is  a  <nul>,,

          If the previous  character  on  the  line  was  an
          autoindent character, erase characters to move the
          cursor back to the column  immediately  after  the
          previous  (1-based)  column which is a multiple of
          the sshhiiffttwwiiddtthh edit option.  This  may  result  in
          any number of <tab> aanndd <<ssppaaccee>> characters preced-
          ing the cursor being changed.

          Otherwise, if the aauuttooiinnddeenntt option is set and the
          user  is entering the first character in the line,

          Addressing  in  eexx  (and when eexx commands are exe-
     cuted from vvii) relates to the current  line.   In  gen-
     eral,  the  current line is the last line affected by a
     command.  The exact effect on the current line is  dis-
     cussed under the description of each command.  When the
     file contains no lines, the current line is zero.

          Addresses are constructed by one or  more  of  the
     following methods:

      (1)   The address "."  refers to the current line.

      (2)   The  address  "$" refers to the last line of the
            file.

      (3)   The address "N", where N is a  positive  number,
            refers to the N-th line of the file.

      (4)   The  address  "'<character>"  or  "`<character>"
            refers to the line marked with the name <charac-
            ter>.   (See the kk or mm commands for more infor-
            mation on how to mark lines.)

      (5)   A regular expression (RE)  enclosed  by  slashes
            ("/")  is an address, and it refers to the first
            line found by searching forward  from  the  line
            _a_f_t_e_r  the  current  line  toward the end of the
            file, and stopping at the first line  containing
            a  string  matching the RE.  (The trailing slash
            can be omitted at the end of the command  line.)

            If no RE is specified, i.e. the pattern is "//_"_,

      (7)   An address followed by a plus sign  ("+_"_)  _o_r  _a
            _m_i_n_u_s _s_i_g_n _(_"_-") followed by a number is an off-
            set address and refers to the address  plus  (or
            minus)  the  indicated  number of lines.  If the
            address is omitted, the addition or  subtraction
            is done with respect to the current line.

      (8)   An address of "+" or "-" followed by a number is
            an offset from the current line.   For  example,
            "-5" is the same as ".-5".

      (9)   An address ending with "+" or "-" has 1 added to
            or subtracted from  the  address,  respectively.
            As  a consequence of this rule and of the previ-
            ous rule, the address "-"  refers  to  the  line
            preceding  the current line.  Moreover, trailing
            "+" and "-" characters have a cumulative effect.
            For  example, "++-++" refers to the current line

          EExx  commands  require zero, one, or two addresses.
     It is an error to specify an address to a command which

     ccoouunntt
          A positive integer, specifying the number of lines
          to be affected by the command; the default  is  1.
          Generally,  a  count  past  the end-of-file may be
          specified, e.g. the command "p 3000"" iinn aa 1100  lliinnee
          ffiillee  iiss  aacccceeppttaabbllee,, aanndd wwiillll pprriinntt ffrroomm tthhee ccuurr--

     ffllaaggss
          One or more of the characters "#", "p",  and  "l".
          When a command that accepts these flags completes,
          the addressed line(s) are written out as if by the
          corresponding  ##,  ll  or pp commands.  In addition,
          any number of "+"" oorr ""--" characters can be  speci-
          fied  before, after, or during the flags, in which
          case the line written is not necessarily  the  one
          affected  by  the  command,  but  rather  the line
          addressed by the offset  address  specified.   The
          default for flags iiss nnoonnee..

     ffiillee
          A  pattern  used to derive a pathname; the default
          is the current file.  File names are subjected  to
          normal _s_h(1) word expansions.

          Anywhere a file name is specified, it is also pos-
     sible to use the special string "/tmp".  This  will  be
     replaced  with  a temporary file name which can be used
     for temporary work, e.g.  ":e /tmp" creates and edits a
     new file.

          If both a count and a range are specified for com-
     mands that use either, the starting line for  the  com-
     mand  is  the  _l_a_s_t  line  addressed  by the range, and
     count_- _s_u_b_s_e_q_u_e_n_t _l_i_n_e_s _a_r_e _a_f_f_e_c_t_e_d  _b_y  _t_h_e  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_,
     _e_._g_.  _t_h_e  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _"_2_,_3_p_4" prints out lines 3, 4, 5 and
     6.

          When only a line or range is  specified,  with  no
     command,  the  implied command is either a lliisstt, nnuummbbeerr
     or pprriinntt command.  The command used is the most  recent
     of  the three commands to have been used (including any
     use as a flag).  If none of these  commands  have  been
     used  before, the pprriinntt command is the implied command.
     When no range or count is  specified  and  the  command
     line  is  a blank line, the current line is incremented
     by 1 and then the current line is displayed.

          Zero or more whitespace characters may precede  or
     follow  the  addresses,  count, flags, or command name.

     Any object following a command name  (such  as  buffer,
     file,  etc.), that begins with an alphabetic character,
     should be separated from the command name by  at  least
     one whitespace character.

          Any  character,  including  <carriage-return>, "%"
     and "#" retain their literal value when preceded  by  a
     backslash.

          The   following  section  describes  the  commands
     available in the eexx editor.  In each entry  below,  the
     tag line is a usage synopsis for the command.

          Each  command  can  be entered as the abbreviation
     (those characters in the synopsis command word  preced-
     ing  the  "[" character), the full command (all charac-
     ters shown for the command word, omitting the  "["  and
     "]" characters), or any leading subset of the full com-
     mand down to the abbreviation.  For example,  the  args
     command  (shown  as  "ar[gs]"  in  the synopsis) can be
     entered as "ar", "arg" or "args".

          Each eexx command described below notes the new cur-
     rent  line after it is executed, as well as any options
     that affect the command.

          There are a large number of options  that  may  be
     set  (or  unset) to change the editor's behavior.  This
     section describes the options, their abbreviations  and
     their default values.

          In  each  entry  below,  the first part of the tag
     line is the full name of the option,  followed  by  any
     equivalent abbreviations.  (Regardless of the abbrevia-
     tions, it is only necessary to use the  minimum  number
     of  characters necessary to distinguish an abbreviation
     from all other commands  for  it  to  be  accepted,  in
     nneexx/nnvvii.   Historically,  only  the  full  name and the
     official abbreviations were accepted by  eexx/vvii.   Using










UUSSDD::1133--8800                        NNvvii//NNeexx RReeffeerreennccee ((OOppttiioonnss))


     full  names  in  your  startup  files and environmental
     variables will probably make them more portable.)   The
     part  in  square  brackets  is the default value of the
     option.  Most of the options are boolean, i.e. they are
     either  on or off, and do not have an associated value.

          Options apply to both eexx and vvii modes, unless oth-
     erwise specified.

          With  a  few  exceptions, all options are settable
     per screen, i.e. the ttaaggss option can be set differently
     in each screen.  The exceptions are the ccoolluummnnss, lliinneess,
     sseeccuurree and tteerrmm options.  Changing these options  modi-
     fies the respective information for all screens.

          For  information  on  modifying  the options or to
     display the options and their current values,  see  the
     "set" command in the section entitled "EExx CCoommmmaannddss".

          VVii  only.   Change  how  vvii does word erase during
          text input.  When this option is set, text is bro-
          ken up into three classes: alphabetic, numeric and
          underscore characters, other nonblank  characters,
          and  blank characters.  Changing from one class to
          another marks the end of a word.  In addition, the
          class  of  the  first  character erased is ignored
          (which is exactly what you want when erasing path-
          name components).

          indented  to  align the cursor with the first non-
          blank character of the line from which you created
          it.   Lines  are  indented using tab characters to
          the extent possible (based on  the  value  of  the

          EExx only.  EExx error messages are normally presented
          in inverse video.  If that is not possible for the

          This  option  causes all regular expressions to be

     ffllaasshh [[oonn]]
          This option causes the screen to flash instead  of
          beeping  the  keyboard,  on error, if the terminal
          has the capability.

     hhaarrddttaabbss,, hhtt [[88]]
          This option defines the spacing  between  hardware
          tab  settings, i.e.  the tab expansion done by the
          operating system and/or the terminal  itself.   As

          The  iicclloowweerr edit option makes all Regular Expres-
          sions case-insensitive, as long as  an  upper-case
          letter does not appear in the search string.

     iiggnnoorreeccaassee,, iicc [[ooffff]]
          This option causes regular expressions, both in eexx
          commands and in searches, to  be  evaluated  in  a
          case-insensitive manner.

     kkeeyyttiimmee [[66]]
          The  10th's  of  a second eexx/vvii waits for a subse-
          quent key to complete a key mapping.

     lleeffttrriigghhtt [[ooffff]]
          VVii only.  This option  causes  the  screen  to  be
          scrolled  left-right to view lines longer than the
          screen,  instead  of  the  traditional  vvii  screen
          interface which folds long lines at the right-hand
          margin of the terminal.

     lliisspp [[ooffff]]

          vvii  ((,  )),  {{,  }}, [[[[ and ]]]] commands to match the
          Lisp  language.   Also,  the  aauuttooiinnddeenntt  option's

          This  option  causes  lines  to be displayed in an

          played  as control characters, i.e.  "^I"",, aanndd tthhee

     lloocckk [[oonn]]
          This option causes the editor to attempt to get an
          exclusive  lock  on any file being edited, read or
          written.  Reading or writing a file that cannot be
          locked  produces  a  warning message, but no other
          effect.  Editing a  file  that  cannot  be  locked
          results  in  a  read  only edit session, as if the
          rreeaaddoonnllyy edit option were set.

     mmaaggiicc [[oonn]]
          This option is on by default.  Turning  the  mmaaggiicc
          option  off  causes all regular expression charac-
          ters except for "^"" aanndd  ""$$",  to  be  treated  as
          ordinary   characters.   To  re-enable  characters
          individually, when the mmaaggiicc option is  off,  pre-

          VVii  only.  The 10th's of a second vvii pauses on the
          matching character when the  sshhoowwmmaattcchh  option  is
          set.

     mmeessgg [[oonn]]
          This  option  allows  other  users  to contact you
          using the _t_a_l_k(1) and  _w_r_i_t_e(1)  utilities,  while
          you  are editing.  EExx/vvii does not turn message on,
          i.e. if messages were turned off when  the  editor
          was  invoked,  they  will  stay  turned off.  This
          option only permits you to disallow  messages  for
          the  edit  session.   See  the _m_e_s_g(1) utility for
          more information.

     mmssggccaatt [[..//]]
          This option selects a message catalog to  be  used
          to  display  error and informational messages in a
          specified language.  If the value of  this  option
          ends  with  a  '/', it is treated as the name of a
          directory  that   contains   a   message   catalog
          "vi_XXXX"",,  wwhheerree  ""XXXXXXXX" is the value of the LANG

          the option is treated as the full path name of the
          message catalog to use.

          If  any messages are missing from the catalog, the

          If the mmooddeelliinneess option is set, eexx/vvii has histori-
          cally  scanned  the  first  and last five lines of
          each file as it is read for editing,  looking  for
          any  eexx  commands  that  have been placed in those
          lines.  After the  startup  information  has  been
          processed,  and before the user starts editing the
          file, any commands embedded in the file  are  exe-
          cuted.

          Commands were recognized by the letters "e" or "v"
          followed by "x" or "i", at the beginning of a line
          or  following  a  tab or space character, and fol-
          lowed by a ":", an eexx command, and another ":".

          This option is a security problem of immense  pro-
          portions, and should not be used under any circum-
          stances.

     nnoopprriinntt [[""""]]
          Characters that are  never  handled  as  printable
          characters.   By  default,  the C library function
          _i_s_p_r_i_n_t(3) is used to determine if a character  is
          printable or not.  This edit option overrides that
          decision.

          for the {{ and  }}  commands.   The  value  of  this
          option  must  be  a character string consisting of

          Characters that are always  handled  as  printable
          characters.   By  default,  the C library function
          _i_s_p_r_i_n_t(3) is used to determine if a character  is
          printable or not.  This edit option overrides that
          decision.

     rreeaaddoonnllyy,, rroo [[ooffff]]
          This option causes a force flag to be required  to
          attempt to write the file.  Setting this option is
          equivalent to using the --RR command line option, or
          executing the vvii program using the name vviieeww.

          The  rreeaaddoonnllyy  edit  option is not usually persis-
          tent, like other edit options.  If the --RR  command
          line option is set, vvii is executed as vviieeww, or the
          rreeaaddoonnllyy edit option is explicitly set, all  files
          edited  in the screen will be marked readonly, and
          the force flag will be  required  to  write  them.
          However,  if none of these conditions are true, or
          the rreeaaddoonnllyy edit option is explicitly unset, then
          the  rreeaaddoonnllyy edit option will toggle based on the
          write permissions  of  the  file  currently  being
          edited  as  of  when  it  is  loaded into the edit
          buffer.  In other words, the rreeaaddoonnllyy edit  option
          will  be  set if the current file lacks write per-
          missions, and will not be  set  if  the  user  has
          write permissions for the file.

          displayed  to  the  user.   For everything but the

          which  the  editor  is  silent, i.e. by default, 6
          lines must be deleted before the user is notified.
          However,  if the number of lines yanked is greater

          Historically,  the  eexx  zz  command, when specified
          without a count, used two times the  size  of  the

          the window size, which is a better choice.

     sseeaarrcchhiinnccrr [[ooffff]]
          The sseeaarrcchhiinnccrr edit option makes the  search  com-
          mands  //  and  ??   incremental, i.e. the screen is
          updated and the cursor moves to the matching  text
          as  the  search pattern is entered.  If the search
          pattern is not found, the screen is beeped and the
          cursor remains on the colon-command line.  Erasing
          characters from the search pattern backs the  cur-
          sor up to the previous matching text.

          The  sseeccuurree  edit  option  turns off all access to

          This option affects the display algorithm used  by

          tation.   See the vveerrbboossee option for more informa-
          tion.

     ttiillddeeoopp
          Modify the ~~ command to take an associated motion.

     ttiimmeeoouutt,, ttoo [[oonn]]
          If  this option is set, eexx/vvii waits for a specific
          period for a subsequent key to complete a key map-
          ping  (see  the kkeeyyttiimmee option).  If the option is
          not set, the editor waits until  enough  keys  are
          entered  to  resolve  the ambiguity, regardless of
          how long it takes.

     ttttyywweerraassee [[ooffff]]
          VVii only.  This option changes  how  vvii  does  word
          erase  during  text input.  If this option is set,
          text is broken up into two classes, blank  charac-
          ters  and  nonblank characters.  Changing from one
          class to another marks the end of a word.

     vveerrbboossee [[ooffff]]
          VVii only.  VVii historically bells the  terminal  for
          many  obvious  mistakes,  e.g. trying to move past
          the left-hand margin, or past the end of the file.
          If  this  option  is set, an error message is dis-
          played for all errors.

     ww330000 [[nnoo ddeeffaauulltt]]
          VVii only.  Set the window size if the baud rate  is
          less  than  1200  baud.  See the wwiinnddooww option for
          more information.

     ww11220000 [[nnoo ddeeffaauulltt]]
          VVii only.  Set the window size if the baud rate  is










NNvvii//NNeexx RReeffeerreennccee ((OOppttiioonnss))                        UUSSDD::1133--9933


          equal  to  1200  baud.   See the wwiinnddooww option for
          more information.

     ww99660000 [[nnoo ddeeffaauulltt]]
          VVii only.  Set the window size if the baud rate  is
          greater than 1200 baud.  See the wwiinnddooww option for
          more information.

     wwaarrnn [[oonn]]
          EExx only.  This option causes a warning message  to
          the  terminal if the file has been modified, since
          it was last written, before a !!  command.

     wwiinnddooww,, ww,, wwii [[eennvviirroonnmmeenntt vvaarriiaabbllee LLIINNEESS -- 11]]
          This option determines the default number of lines
          in a screenful, as displayed by the zz command.  It
          also determines the number of  lines  scrolled  by
          the  vvii  commands <<ccoonnttrrooll--BB>> and <<ccoonnttrrooll--FF>>, and
          the default number of lines  scrolled  by  the  vvii
          commands  <<ccoonnttrrooll--DD>>  and <<ccoonnttrrooll--UU>>.  The value
          of window can be  unrelated  to  the  real  screen
          size,  although  it  starts  out  as the number of
          lines on the screen.   See  the  section  entitled
          "SSiizziinngg tthhee SSccrreeeenn" for more information.  Setting
          the value of the wwiinnddooww  option  is  the  same  as
          using the --ww command line option.

          If  the  value of the wwiinnddooww option (as set by the
          wwiinnddooww, ww330000, ww11220000 or ww99660000 options)  is  smaller
          than  the  actual size of the screen, large screen
          movements will  result  in  displaying  only  that
          smaller  number  of lines on the screen.  (Further
          movements in that same area  will  result  in  the
          screen  being filled.)  This can provide a perfor-
          mance improvement when viewing different places in
          one or more files over a slow link.

          Resetting  the  window  size  does  not  reset the
          default number of lines scrolled by the  <<ccoonnttrrooll--
          DD>> and <<ccoonnttrrooll--UU>> commands.

     wwrraapplleenn,, wwll [[00]]
          This option is identical to the wwrraappmmaarrggiinn option,
          with the exception that it specifies the number of
          columns  from  the  _l_e_f_t  margin  before  the line
          splits, not the right margin.

          If both wwrraapplleenn and wwrraappmmaarrggiinn are set, the  wwrraapp--
          mmaarrggiinn value is used.

     wwrraappmmaarrggiinn,, wwmm [[00]]
          VVii only.  If the value of the wwrraappmmaarrggiinn option is
          non-zero, vvii will split lines so that they end  at

          least that number of columns before the right-hand
          margin of the screen.  (Note, the value  of  wwrraapp--
          mmaarrggiinn  is _n_o_t a text length.  In a screen that is

          If wrapmargin is set to 0, or if there is no blank
          character upon which to split the line,  the  line
          is not broken.

          If  both wwrraapplleenn and wwrraappmmaarrggiinn are set, the wwrraapp--
          mmaarrggiinn value is used.

     wwrraappssccaann,, wwss [[oonn]]
          This option causes searches to wrap around the end
          or  the  beginning  of  the  file, and back to the
          starting point.  Otherwise, the end  or  beginning
          of the file terminates the search.

     wwrriitteeaannyy,, wwaa [[ooffff]]
          If  this  option  is  set, file-overwriting checks
          that would usually be made before  the  wwrriittee  and
          xxiitt  commands,  or  before an automatic write (see
          the aauuttoowwrriittee option), are not made.  This  allows
          a write to any file, provided the file permissions
          allow it.
