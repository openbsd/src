.Nd compare compressed files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zcmp
.Op Ar options
.Ar file1
.Op Ar file2
.Nm zdiff
.Op Ar options
.Ar file1
.Op Ar file2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm zcmp
and
.Nm zdiff
are filters that invoke
.Xr cmp 1
or
.Xr diff 1
respectively to compare compressed files.
Such files generally have a
.Dq Z
or
.Dq gz
extension (both the
.Xr compress 1
and
.Xr gzip 1
formats are supported).
Any
.Ar options
that are specified are passed to
.Xr cmp 1
or
.Xr diff 1 .
.Pp
If only
.Ar file1
is specified, it is compared against a file with the same name, but
with the extension removed.
When both
.Ar file1
or
.Ar file2
are specified, either file may be compressed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "TMPDIR"
.It Ev TMPDIR
Directory in which to place temporary files.
If unset,
.Pa /tmp
is used.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cmp 1 ,

.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm zcmp
and
.Nm zdiff
rely solely on the file extension to determine what is, or is not,
a compressed file.
