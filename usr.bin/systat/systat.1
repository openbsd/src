.Sh NAME
.Nm systat
.Nd display system statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm systat
.Op Fl aBbiNn
.Op Fl d Ar count
.Op Fl s Ar delay
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Op Ar view
.Op Ar delay
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays various system statistics in a screen-oriented fashion
using the
.Xr curses 3
screen display library.
.Pp
While
.Nm
is running, the screen is divided into different areas.
The top line displays the current number of users, the
three system load average figures over the last 1, 5, and
15 minute intervals, and the system time.
The bottom line of the screen is reserved for
user input and error messages.
The information displayed in the rest of the screen
comprises a
.Em view ,
and is the main interface for
displaying different types of system statistics.
The
.Ic vmstat
view is the default.
.Pp
Certain information may be discarded when the screen size is
insufficient for display.
For example, on a machine with 10 drives the
.Ic iostat
bar graph displays only 3 drives on a 24 line terminal.
.\".Pp
.\"Input is interpreted at two different levels.
.\"A
.\".Dq global
.\"command interpreter processes all keyboard input.
.\"If this command interpreter fails to recognize a command, the
.\"input line is passed to a per-display command interpreter.
.\"This allows each display to have certain display-specific commands.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display all lines.
.It Fl B
Raw, non-interactive mode.
The default is to exit after two screen updates,
with statistics only ever displayed once.
Useful for views such as
.Ic cpu ,
where initial calculations are useless.
.It Fl b
Raw, non-interactive mode.
The default is to exit after one screen update,
with statistics displayed every update.
.It Fl d Ar count
Exit after
.Ar count
screen updates.
.It Fl i
Interactive mode.
.It Fl N
Resolve network addresses to names.
This is the opposite of the
.Fl n
option.
.It Fl n
Do not try to reverse map IP addresses.
This is the default.
.It Fl s Ar delay
Specifies the screen refresh time interval in seconds.
This option is overridden by the final
.Ar delay
argument, if given.
The default interval is 5 seconds.
.It Fl w Ar width
Specifies the maximum width of the output in raw, non-interactive mode.
.It Ar view
The
.Ar view
argument expects to be one of:
.Ic vmstat ,
.Ic pigs ,
.Ic ifstat ,
.Ic iostat ,
.Ic sensors ,
.Ic mbufs ,
.Ic netstat ,
.Ic swap ,
.Ic states ,
.Ic rules ,
.Ic queues ,
.Ic pf ,
.Ic pool ,
.Ic pcache ,
.Ic malloc ,
.Ic buckets ,
.Ic nfsclient ,
.Ic nfsserver ,
or
.Ic cpu .
These displays can also be requested interactively and are described in
full detail below.
.Ar view
may be abbreviated to the minimum unambiguous prefix;
for example,
.Dq io
for
.Dq iostat .
.It Ar delay
The
.Ar delay
argument specifies the screen refresh time interval in seconds.
This is provided for backwards compatibility, and overrides any
interval specified with the
.Fl s
flag.
The default interval is 5 seconds.
.El
.Pp
Certain characters cause immediate action by
.Nm .
These are:
.Bl -tag -width Fl

combination of columns.
Available orderings depend on the view.
Not all views support orderings.
.It Ic p
Pause
.Nm .
.It Ic q
Quit
.Nm .
.It Ic r
Reverse the selected ordering if supported by the view.
.It Ic \&,
Print numbers with thousand separators, where applicable.
.It Ic ^A | Aq Ic Home
Jump to the beginning of the current view.
.It Ic ^B | Aq Ic right arrow
Select the previous view.
.It Ic ^E | Aq Ic End
Jump to the end of the current view.
.It Ic ^F | Aq Ic left arrow
Select the next view.
.It Ic ^G
Print the name of the current
view being shown and the refresh interval.
.It Ic ^L

.Pp
The following commands are interpreted by the
.Dq global
command interpreter.
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ic help
Print the names of the available views on the command line.
.It Ic order
Print the names of the available orderings on the command line.

.Nm .
(This may be abbreviated to
.Ic q . )
.It Ic stop
Stop refreshing the screen.
.It Xo
.Op Ic start
.Op Ar number
.Xc

If a second, numeric,
argument is provided it is interpreted as a refresh interval
(in seconds).
Supplying only a number will set the refresh interval to this
value.
.El
.Pp
.Ar view
may be abbreviated to the minimum unambiguous prefix.
The available views are:
.Bl -tag -width "netstatXXX"
.It Ic buckets
Display kernel
.Xr malloc 9
bucket statistics similar to the output of
.Cm vmstat Fl m .
.It Ic cpu

.Sm off
.Xo
.Cm up | dn
.Bq : Cm U | D .
.Xc
.Sm on
.Sq up
and
.Sq dn
represent whether the interface is up or down.
.Sq U
and
.Sq D
represent whether the interface is connected or not;
in the case of
.Xr carp 4
interfaces, whether the interface is in master or backup state, respectively.
.Pp
The character
.Ic B
changes the counter view between bytes and bits.
Pressing
.Ic b
displays statistics as calculated from boot time.
.Ic r
changes the counters to show their totals as calculated
between display refreshes.
.Ic t
changes the counters to show the average per second over
the display refresh interval;
this is the default.
.It Ic iostat

It is also possible to have addresses displayed symbolically,
when possible, and limit the display to a set of protocols
(the minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied):
.Bl -tag -width Ar

columns.
.It Ic swap
Show information about swap space usage on all the
swap areas compiled into the kernel.
The first column is the device name of the partition.
The next column is the total space available in the partition.
The
.Ar Used
column indicates the total blocks used so far;
the graph shows the percentage of space in use on each partition.
If there is more than one swap partition in use,
a total line is also shown.
Areas known to the kernel but not in use are shown as not available.
.It Ic vmstat
Take over the entire display and show a (rather crowded) compendium
of statistics related to virtual memory usage, process scheduling,
device interrupts, system name translation caching, disk I/O, etc.
This view is the default.
.Pp
Below the top line are statistics on memory utilization.
The first row of the table reports memory usage only among
active processes, that is, processes that have run in the previous
twenty seconds.
The second row reports on memory usage of all processes.
The first column reports on the amount of physical memory
claimed by processes.
The second column reports the same figure for
virtual memory, that is, the amount of memory that would be
needed if all processes were resident at the same time.
Finally, the last column shows the amount of physical memory
on the free list.
.Pp
Below the memory display is a list of the average number of processes
(over the last refresh interval) that are runnable
.Pq Sq r ,
in disk wait other than paging
.Pq Sq d ,
sleeping
.Pq Sq s ,
and swapped out but desiring to run
.Pq Sq w .
Below the queue length listing is a numerical listing and
a bar graph showing the amount of
interrupt (shown as
.Ql | ) ,
system (shown as
.Ql = ) ,
user (shown as
.Ql > ) ,
nice (shown as
.Ql - ) ,

.Ql \ \& ) .
.Pp
To the right of the Proc display are statistics about
Context switches
.Pq Dq Csw ,
Traps
.Pq Dq Trp ,
Syscalls
.Pq Dq Sys ,
Interrupts
.Pq Dq Int ,
Soft interrupts
.Pq Dq Sof ,
and Faults
.Pq Dq Flt
which have occurred during the last refresh interval.
.Pp
Below the CPU usage graph are statistics on name translations.
It lists the number of names translated in the previous interval,
the number and percentage of the translations that were
handled by the system wide name translation cache, and
the number and percentage of the translations that were
handled by the per process name translation cache.
.Pp
At the bottom left is the disk usage display.
It reports the number of seeks, transfers, number
of kilobyte blocks transferred per second averaged over the
refresh period of the display, and
the time spent in disk accesses.
.Pp
Under the date in the upper right hand quadrant are statistics
on paging and swapping activity.
The first two columns report the average number of pages
brought in and out per second over the last refresh interval
due to page faults and the paging daemon.
The third and fourth columns report the average number of pages
brought in and out per second over the last refresh interval
due to swap requests initiated by the scheduler.
The first row of the display shows the average
number of disk transfers per second over the last refresh interval.
The second row of the display shows the average
number of pages transferred per second over the last refresh interval.
.Pp
Running down the right hand side of the display is a breakdown
of the interrupts being handled by the system.
At the top of the list is the total interrupts per second
over the time interval.
The rest of the column breaks down the total on a device
by device basis.
Only devices that have interrupted at least once since boot time are shown.
.Pp
Below the Interrupts display are
the average number of input and output packets per second
for all interfaces over the last refresh interval.
.Pp
Below the SWAPPING display and slightly to the left of the Interrupts
display is a list of virtual memory statistics.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
Certain displays presume a minimum of 80 characters per line.
The
.Ic vmstat
display looks out of place because it is (it was added in as
a separate display rather than created as a new program).
