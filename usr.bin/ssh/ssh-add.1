.Sh NAME
.Nm ssh-add
.Nd adds identities for the authentication agent
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ssh-add
.Op Fl ldD
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION 
.Nm
adds identities to the authentication agent,
.Xr ssh-agent 1 .
When run without arguments, it adds the file
.Pa $HOME/.ssh/identity .
Alternative file names can be given on the
command line.  If any file requires a passphrase,
.Nm
asks for the passphrase from the user.  If the user is using X11, the
passphrase is requested using a small X11 program; otherwise it is
read from the user's tty.  (Note: it may be necessary to redirect
stdin from
.Pa /dev/null
to get the passphrase requested using X11.)
.Pp
The authentication agent must be running and must be an ancestor of
the current process for
.Nm
to work.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
Lists all identities currently represented by the agent.
.It Fl d
Instead of adding the identity, removes the identity from the agent.
.It Fl D
Deletes all identities from the agent.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.Pa $HOME/.ssh/identity
Contains the RSA authentication identity of the user.  This file
should not be readable by anyone but the user.  It is possible to
specify a passphrase when generating the key; that passphrase will be
used to encrypt the private part of this file.  This is the
default file added by
.Nm
when no other files have been specified.
.Pp
If
.Nm
needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current
terminal if it was run from a terminal.  If
.Nm
does not have a terminal associated with it but
.Ev DISPLAY
is set, it
will open an X11 window to read the passphrase.  This is particularly
useful when calling
.Nm
from a
.Pa .Xsession
or related script.  (Note that on some machines it
may be necessary to redirect the input from
.Pa /dev/null
to make this work.)
