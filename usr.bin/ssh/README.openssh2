works:
	secsh-transport: works w/o rekey
		proposal exchange, i.e. different enc/mac/comp per direction
		encryption: blowfish-cbc, 3des-cbc, arcfour, cast128-cbc
		mac: hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, (hmac-ripemd160)
		compression: zlib, none
	secsh-userauth: passwd only
	secsh-connection: pty+shell or command, flow control works (window adjust)
		tcp-forwarding: -L works
	dss: verification works,
		key database in ~/.ssh/known_hosts with bits == 0 hack
	dss: signature works, keygen w/ openssl:
		$ openssl dsaparam 1024 -out dsa1024.pem
		$ openssl gendsa -out /etc/ssh_dsa_key dsa1024.pem -rand /dev/arandom
		start sshd with '-2' flag
	client interops w/ sshd2, lshd
	server interops w/ ssh2, lsh, ssh.com's Windows client, SecureCRT
	server supports multiple concurrent sessions (e.g. with SSH.com Windows client)
todo:
	re-keying
	secsh-connection features:
		 tcp-forwarding, agent-fwd, x11-fwd
	auth other than passwd:
		 pubkey, keyboard-interactive
	config
