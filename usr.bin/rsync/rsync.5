.Sh NAME
.Nm rsync
.Nd rsync wire protocol
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
protocol described in this relates to the BSD-licensed
.Xr openrsync 1 ,
a re-implementation of the GPL-licensed reference utility
.Xr rsync 1 .
It is compatible with version 27 of the reference.
.Pp
In this document, the
.Qq client process
refers to the utility as run on the operator's local computer.
The
.Qq server process
is run either on the local or remote computer, depending upon the
command-line given file locations.
.Pp
There are a number of options in the protocol that are dictated by command-line
flags.
These will be noted as
.Fl D
for devices,
.Fl g
for group ids,
.Fl l
for links,
.Fl n
for dry-run,
.Fl o
for user ids,
.Fl r
for recursion,
.Fl v
for verbose, and
.Fl -delete
for deletion (before).
.Ss Data types
The binary protocol encodes all data in little-endian format.
Integers are signed 32-bit, shorts are signed 16-bit, bytes are unsigned
8-bit.
A long is variable-length.
For values less than the maximum integer, the value is transmitted and
read as a 32-bit integer.
For values greater, the value is transmitted first as a maximum integer,
then a 64-bit signed integer.
.Pp
There are three types of checksums: long (slow), short (fast), and
whole-file.
The fast checksum is a derivative of Adler-32.
The slow checksum is MD4,
made over the checksum seed first (serialised in little-endian format),
then the data.
The whole-file applies MD4 to the file first, then the checksum seed at
the end (also serialised in little-endian format).
.Ss Multiplexing
Most
.Nm
transmissions are wrapped in a multiplexing envelope protocol.
It is composed as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
envelope header (4 bytes)
.It
envelope payload (arbitrary length)
.El
.Pp
The first byte of the envelope header consists of a tag.
If the tag is 7, the payload is normal data.
Otherwise, the payload is out-of-band server messages.
If the tag is 1, it is an error on the sender's part and must trigger an
exit.
This limits message payloads to 24 bit integer size,
.Li 0x0fffffff .
.Pp
The only data not using this envelope are the initial handshake between
client and server.
.Ss File list
A central part of the protocol is the file list, which is generated by
the sender.
It consists of all files that must be sent to the receiver, either
explicitly as given or recursively generated.
.Pp
The file list itself consists of filenames and attributes (mode, time,
size, etc.).
Filenames must be relative to the destination root and not be absolute
or contain backtracking.
So if a file is given to the sender as
.Pa ../../foo/bar ,
it must be sent as
.Pa foo/bar .
.Pp
The file list should be cleaned of inappropriate files prior to sending.
For example, if
.Fl l
is not specified, symbolic links may be omitted.
Directory entries without
.Fl r
may also be omitted.
Duplicates may be omitted.
.Pp
The receiver
.Em must not
assume that the file list is clean.
It should not omit inappropriate files from the file list (which would
affect the indexing), but may omit them during processing.
.Pp
Prior to be sent from sender to receiver, and upon being received, the
file list must be lexicographically sorted such as with
.Xr strcmp 3 .
Subsequent references to the file are by index in the sorted list.
.Ss Client process
The client can operate in sender or receiver mode depending upon the
command-line source and destination.
.Pp
If the destination directory (sink) is remote, the client is in sender
mode: the client will push its data to the server.
If the source file is remote, it is in receiver mode: the server pushes
to the client.
If neither are remote, the client operates in sender mode.
These are all mutually exclusive.
.Pp
When the client starts, regardless its mode, it first handshakes the
server.
This exchange is
.Em not
multiplexed.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
send local version (integer)
.It
receive remote version (integer)
.It
receive random seed (integer)
.El
.Pp
Following this, the client multiplexes when reading from the server.
Transmissions sent from client to server are not multiplexed.
It then enters the
.Sx Update exchange
protocol.
.Ss Server process
The server can operate in sender or receiver mode depending upon how the
client starts the server.
This may be directly from the parent process (when invoked for local
files) or indirectly via a remote shell.
.Pp
When in sender mode, the server pushes data to the client.
(This is equivalent to receiver mode for the client.)
In receiver, the opposite is true.
.Pp
When the server starts, regardless the mode, it first handshakes the
client.
This exchange is
.Em not
multiplexed.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
send local version (integer)
.It
receive remote version (integer)
.It
send random seed (integer)
.El
.Pp
Following this, the server multiplexes when writing to the client.
(Transmissions received from the client are not multiplexed.)
It then enters the
.Sx Update exchange
protocol.
.Ss Update exchange
When the client or server is in sender mode, it begins by conditionally
sending the exclusion list.
At this time, this is always empty.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
if
.Fl -delete
and the client, exclusion list zero (integer)
.El
.Pp
It then sends the
.Sx File list .
Prior to being sent, the file list should be lexicographically sorted.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
status byte (integer)
.It
inherited filename length (optional, byte)
.It
filename length (integer or byte)
.It
file (byte array)
.It
file length (long)
.It
file modification time (optional, time_t, integer)
.It
file mode (optional, mode_t, integer)
.It
if
.Fl o ,
the user id (integer)
.It
if
.Fl g ,
the group id (integer)
.It
if a special file and
.Fl D ,
the device
.Dq rdev
type (integer)
.It
if a symbolic link and
.Fl l ,
the link target's length (integer)
.It
if a symbolic link and
.Fl l ,
the link target (byte array)
.El
.Pp
The status byte may consist of the following bits and determines which
of the optional fields are transmitted.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width Ds
.It 0x01
A top-level directory.
(Only applies to directory files.)
If specified, the matching local directory is for deletions.
.It 0x02
Do not send the file mode: it is a repeat of the last file's mode.
.It 0x08
Like
.Li 0x02 ,
but for the user id.
.It 0x10
Like
.Li 0x02 ,
but for the group id.
.It 0x20
Inherit some of the prior file name.
Enables the inherited filename length transmission.
.It 0x40
Use full integer length for file name.
Otherwise, use only the byte length.
.It 0x80
Do not send the file modification time: it is a repeat of the last
file's.
.El
.Pp
If the status byte is zero, the file-list has terminated.
.Pp
If
.Fl o
has been specified, the sender sends the list of all users encountered
in the file list.
Identifier zero
.Pq Qq root
is never transmitted, as it would prematurely end the list.
This list may be incomplete or empty: the server is not obligated to
properly fill it in with all relevant users.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
user identifier or zero to indicate end of set (integer)
.It
non-zero length of user name (byte)
.It
user name (prior length)
.El
.Pp
The same sequence is then sent for groups if
.Fl g
has been specified.
.Pp
The sender then sends any IO error values, which for
.Xr openrsync 1
is always zero.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
constant zero (integer)
.El
.Pp
The server sender then reads the exclusion list, which is always zero.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
if server, constant zero (integer)
.El
.Pp
Following that, the sender receives data regarding the receiver's copy
of the file list contents.
This data is not ordered in any way.
Each of these requests starts as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
file index or -1 to signal a change of phase (integer)
.El
.Pp
The phase starts in phase 1, then proceeds to phase 2, and phase 3
signals an end of transmission (no subsequent blocks).
If a phase change occurs, the sender must write back the -1 constant
integer value and increment its phase state.
.Pp
Blocks are read as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
block index (integer)
.El
.Pp
In
.Pq Fl n
mode, the sender may immediately write back the index (integer) to skip
the following.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
number of blocks (integer)
.It
block length in the file (integer)
.It
long checksum length (integer)
.It
terminal (remainder) block length (integer)
.El
.Pp
And for each block:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
short checksum (integer)
.It
long checksum (bytes of checksum length)
.El
.Pp
The client then compares the two files, block by block, and updates the
server with mismatches as follows.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
file index (integer)
.It
number of blocks (integer)
.It
block length (integer)
.It
long checksum length (integer)
.It
remainder block length (integer)
.El
.Pp
Then for each block:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
data chunk size (integer)
.It
data chunk (bytes)
.It
block index subsequent to chunk or zero for finished (integer)
.El
.Pp
Following this sequence, the sender sends the following:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
whole-file long checksum (16 bytes)
.El
.Pp
The sender then either handles the next queued file or, if the receiver
has written a phase change, the phase change step.
.Pp
If the sender is the server and
.Fl v
has been specified, the sender must send statistics.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
total bytes read (long)
.It
total bytes written (long)
.It
total size of files (long)
.El
.Pp
Finally, the sender must read a final constant-value integer.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
end-of-sequence -1 value (integer)
.El
.Pp
If in receiver mode, the inverse above (write instead of read, read
instead of write) is performed.
.Pp
The receiver begins by conditionally writing, then reading, the
exclusion list count, which is always zero.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
if client, send zero (integer)
.It
if receiver and
.Fl -delete ,
read zero (integer)
.El
.Pp
The receiver then proceeds with reading the
.Sx File list
as already
defined.
Following the list, the receiver reads the IO error, which must be zero.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
constant zero (integer)
.El
.Pp
The receiver must then sort the file names lexicographically.
.Pp
If there are no files in the file list at this time, the receiver must
exit prior to sending per-file data.
It then proceeds with the file blocks.
.Pp
For file blocks, the receiver must look at each file that is not up to
date, defined by having the same file size and timestamp, and send it to
the server.
Symbolic links and directory entries are never sent to the server.
.Pp
After the second phase has completed and prior to writing the
end-of-data signal, the client receiver reads statistics.
This is only performed with
.Pq Fl v .
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
total bytes read (long)
.It
total bytes written (long)
.It
total size of files (long)
.El
.Pp
Finally, the receiver must send the constant end-of-sequence marker.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
end-of-sequence -1 value (integer)
.El
.Ss Sender and receiver asynchrony
The sender and receiver need not work in lockstep.
The receiver may send file update requests as quickly as it parses them,
and respond to the sender's update notices on demand.
Similarly, the sender may read as many update requests as it can, and
service them in any order it wishes.
.Pp
The sender and receiver synchronise state only at the end of phase.
.Pp
The reference
.Xr rsync 1
takes advantage of this with a two-process receiver, one for sending
update requests (the generator) and another for receiving.
.Xr openrsync 1
uses an event-loop model instead.

Time values are sent as 32-bit integers.
.Pp
When in server mode
.Em and
when communicating to a client with a newer protocol (>27), the phase
change integer (-1) acknowledgement must be sent twice by the sender.
The is probably a bug in the reference implementation.
