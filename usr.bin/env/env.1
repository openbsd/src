.Sh NAME
.Nm env
.Nd set and print environment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm env
.Op Fl i
.Oo
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value ...
.Oc
.Oo
.Ar utility
.Op Ar argument ...
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
executes
.Ar utility
after modifying the environment as
specified on the command line.
The option
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
specifies
an environment variable,
.Ar name ,
with a value of
.Ar value .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Causes
.Nm
to completely ignore the environment it inherits.
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar utility
is specified,
.Nm
prints out the names and values
of the variables in the environment, with one
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
pair per line.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
.Ar utility
was invoked and completed successfully.
In this case the exit code is returned by the utility itself, not
.Nm .
If no utility was specified, then
.Nm
completed successfully and returned the exit code itself.
.It 1
An invalid command line option was passed to
.Nm .
.It 1\(en125
.Ar utility
was invoked but failed in some way;
see its manual page for more information.
In this case the exit code is returned by the utility itself, not
.Nm .
.It 126
.Ar utility
was found but could not be invoked.
.It 127
.Ar utility
could not be found.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr execvp 3 ,
.Xr environ 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The historic
.Fl
option has been deprecated but is still supported in this implementation.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
doesn't handle commands with equal
.Pq Sq =
signs in their
names, for obvious reasons.
