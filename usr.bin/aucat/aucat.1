.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the specified device.
By default,
.Nm
plays audio through the
.Pa /dev/audio
device.
The
.Ar file
operands are processed in command line order.
.Pp
If a Sun .au header is
detected it is skipped over and not copied to
.Pa /dev/audio .
If a Microsoft .wav header (RIFF) is detected it is interpreted to
select the right audio encoding for playback and the data chunk of the
file is copied to
.Pa /dev/audio ,
given that the audio driver directly supports the encoding.
Otherwise, the entire file is copied to
.Pa /dev/audio .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-f deviceXX"
