.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can record one input stream
and store it on multiple destination files,
doing the necessary conversions on the fly.
It can play, convert, and mix multiple input files simultaneously.
.Nm
also has a legacy mode that works like previous versions of
.Nm ,
which does not convert on the fly and supports playback of .au files.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-m mmmmmmmm "
.It Xo
.Fl C Ar min : Ns Ar max ,
.Fl c Ar min : Ns Ar max
.Xc
The range of channel numbers on the output or input stream, respectively.
The default is 0:1, i.e. stereo.
.It Fl E Ar enc , Fl e Ar enc
Encoding of the output or input stream, respectively (see below).
The default is signed, 16-bit, native byte order.
.It Fl f Ar device
The
.Xr audio 4
device to use for playing and/or recording.
The default is
.Pa /dev/audio .
.It Fl H Ar fmt , Fl h Ar fmt
File format of the output or input stream, respectively (see below).
The default is auto.
.It Fl i Ar file
Add this file to the list of files to play.
If the option argument is
.Sq -
then standard input will be used.
.It Fl o Ar file
Add this file to the list of files in which to store recorded samples.
If the option argument is
.Sq -
then standard output will be used.
.It Fl q
Do not print progress information; run quietly.
.It Fl R Ar rate , Fl r Ar rate
Sample rate in Hertz of the output or input stream, respectively.
The default is 44100Hz.
.It Fl u
Normally
.Nm
tries to automatically determine the optimal parameters for the audio device;
if this option is specified,
it will instead use the parameters specified by the
.Fl CcEeRr
options.
.It Fl X Ar policy
Action when the output stream cannot accept
recorded data fast enough.
If the policy
is
.Dq ignore
(the default) then samples that cannot be written are discarded.
If the policy is
.Dq sync
then samples are discarded, but the same amount of silence will be written
once the stream is unblocked, in order to reach the right position in time.
If the policy is
.Dq error
then the stream is closed permanently.
.It Fl x Ar policy
Action when the input stream cannot provide
data to play fast enough.
If the policy is
.Dq ignore
(the default) then silence is played.
If the policy is
.Dq sync
then silence is played, but the same amount of samples will be discarded
once the stream is unblocked, in order to reach the right position in time.
If the policy is
.Dq error
then the stream is closed permanently.
.El
.Pp
Settings for input
.Pq Fl i
and output
.Pq Fl o
files can be changed using the
.Fl CcEeHhRrXx
options.
The last
.Fl CcEeHhRrXx
options specified before an
.Fl i
or
.Fl o
are applied to
.Ar file .
.Pp
Settings for the audio device
can be changed using the
.Fl CcEeRr
options.
They apply to the audio device only if the
.Fl u
option is given as well.
The last
.Fl CcEeRr
option specified before an
.Fl f
is applied to
.Ar device .
.Pp
If no audio device
.Pq Fl f
is specified but
.Fl u
is given anyway,
any
.Fl CcEeRr
options specified before
.Fl io
options are applied both to
.Ar file
and the default audio device;
if they are specified after
.Fl io
options,
they will be applied only to the default audio device.
.Pp
File formats are specified using the
.Fl H
and
.Fl h
options.
The following file formats are supported:
.Bl -tag -width s32lexxx -offset -indent
.It raw
Headerless file.
This format is recommended since it has no limitations.
.It wav
Microsoft WAVE file format.
There are limitations inherent to the file format itself:
not all encodings are supported,
file sizes are limited to 2GB,
and the file must support the
.Xr lseek 2
operation (e.g. pipes do not support it).
.It auto
Try to guess, depending on the file name.
.El
.Pp
Encodings are specified using the
.Fl E
and
.Fl e
options.
The following encodings are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width s32lexxx -offset -indent -compact
.It s8
signed 8-bit
.It u8
unsigned 8-bit
.It s16le

.El
.Sh LEGACY MODE
If neither
.Fl i
nor
.Fl o
are specified,
.Nm
will run in legacy mode, and won't convert sample formats or sampling rates.
In legacy mode, all options except
.Fl f
are ignored, and all other arguments are assumed to be names of files.
In legacy mode
.Nm
reads files sequentially, and writes them to the specified device.
If a Sun .au header is detected it is skipped over and not copied to
the audio device.
.Nm
will attempt to play data from Sun .au files as monaural 8-bit ulaw
samples with a sampling frequency of 8000 Hz.
However,
.Nm
will not fail if the audio device cannot be configured for these
parameters.
If a Microsoft .wav header (RIFF) is detected it is interpreted
to select the right audio encoding for playback and the data chunk of the
file is copied to the audio device.
If the device does not support the encoding,
.Nm
will exit with an error.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "AUDIODEVICEXXX" -compact
.It Ev AUCAT_DEBUG
The debug level:
may be a value between 0 and 4.
.It Ev AUDIODEVICE
The audio device to use.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will record a stereo s16le stream at
44100Hz from the default device.
If necessary, the stream will be converted and/or resampled
to match parameters supported by the device:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ aucat -o file.raw
.Ed
.Pp
The following command will play a stereo s16le stream at
44100Hz on the default device, doing any necessary conversions:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ aucat -i file.raw
.Ed
.Pp
The following will mix and play two stereo streams,
the first at 48kHz and the second at 44.1kHz:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ aucat -r 48000 -i file1.raw -r 44100 -i file2.raw
.Ed
.Pp
The following will record channels 2 and 3 into one stereo file and
channels 6 and 7 into another stereo file using a 96kHz sampling rate for
both:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ aucat -R 96000 -C 2:3 -o file1.raw -C 6:7 -o file2.raw
.Ed
.Pp
The following will play two s18le mono files, one on each channel:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ aucat -e s18le -c 0:0 -i f1.raw -c 1:1 -i f2.raw
.Ed
.Pp
The following will mix and play two files and record a third one in
full-duplex:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ aucat -i drums.raw -i bass.raw -o guitar.raw
.Ed

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility assumes non-blocking I/O for input and output streams.
It will not work reliably on files that may block
(ordinary files block, pipes don't).
.Pp
Resampling is low quality; down-sampling especially should be avoided
when recording.
.Pp
CPU usage is the same for all conversions.
It should be smaller for simpler ones.
.Pp
Processing is done using 16-bit arithmetic,
thus samples with more than 16 bits are rounded.
16 bits (i.e. 97dB dynamic) are largely enough for most applications though.
