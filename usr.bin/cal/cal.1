.Dq Li cal 89
will
.Em not

Two numerical parameters denote the
.Ar month
(1 \- 12)
and
.Ar year .
Alternatively,
a single parameter may be given specifying the abbreviated name of a month:
in that case a calendar is displayed for that month of the current year.
If no parameters are specified, the current month's calendar is
displayed.
.Pp
A year starts on January 1st.

The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 after the 2nd
of September.
By this time, most countries had recognized the reformation (although a
few did not recognize it until the early 1900's).
Eleven days following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so the
calendar for that month is a bit unusual.
