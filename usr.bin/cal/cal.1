The options
.Fl j

.Fl w

.It Fl m

.It Fl w

If

The options
.Fl j
and
.Fl w
are mutually exclusive.
.It Fl y

.El
.Pp
A single numerical parameter specifies the
.Ar year
(1 \- 9999)
to be displayed.
The year must be fully specified:
.Dq Li cal 89
will
.Em not
display a calendar for 1989.
Two parameters denote the
.Ar month
(1 \- 12, or a month name or abbreviation thereof)
and
.Ar year .
Alternatively,
a single parameter may be given specifying
the name or abbreviated name of a month:
in that case a calendar is displayed for that month of the current year.
If no parameters are specified, the current month's calendar is
displayed.
.Pp
A year starts on January 1st.
.Pp
The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 after the 2nd
of September.
By this time, most countries had recognized the reformation (although a
few did not recognize it until the early 1900's).
Eleven days following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so the
calendar for that month is a bit unusual.
