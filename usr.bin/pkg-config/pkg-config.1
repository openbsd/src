.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg-config
.Nd fetch metadata about installed software packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg-config
.Op Ar options
.Ar pkg-name Op Ar pkg-name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility retreives metadata about the installation of software packages.
This metadata includes version, compiler and linker flags, and dependency
information.
It is inspired by, and intended to operate as a drop-in replacement to,
the program of the same name available from freedesktop.org.
.Pp
Metadata is stored in files named after the package they describe; the
Yoyodyne package would likely be described by "yoyodyne.pc".
Not all software packages provide
.Nm
metadata.
Packages controlled by the
.Xr ports 7
system store their metadata, if provided, in
.Pa ${LOCALBASE}/lib/pkgconfig ;
the X Window System stores its metadata in
.Pa ${X11BASE}/lib/pkgconfig .
The
.Nm
utility will search these locations by default.
.Pp
Because
.Nm
attempts to output the full set of compiler or linker flags required to
use a package, it will also output the flags required for any prerequisite
packages.
If the "foo" package depends on the "bar" package, "pkg-config --cflags foo"
might output something like "-I/usr/local/include/foo
-I/usr/local/include/bar", even though the compiler flags for "bar" were not
explicitly requested.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -debug
Enable internal development and debugging messages.
.It Fl -help
Print a help message and exit.
.It Fl -usage
Print a help message and exit.
.It Fl -list-all
List all installed packages and exit.
.It Fl -version
Print version of
.Nm
and exit.
.It Fl -errors-to-stdout
Direct error messages to stdout rather than stderr.
.It Fl -print-errors
Print error messages and exit with an error when errors occur.
This is the default.
.It Fl -silence-errors
Do not print error messages, just exit with an error.
.It Fl -atleast-pkgconfig-version Ar version
Exit with error if the version of
.Nm
is greater than or equal to the specified version.
.It Fl -cflags
Return all compiler flags required to compile against the package.
.It Fl -cflags-only-I
Return only the include path flags required to compile against the package.
.It Fl -cflags-only-other
Return all compiler flags, other than the include path flags, required to
compile against the package.
.It Fl -libs
Return all linker flags required to linker against the package.
.It Fl -libs-only-l
Return only the library (-lwhatever) flags required to link against
the package.
.It Fl -libs-only-L
Return only the library path (-L/path/to/lib) flags required to link
against the package.
.It Fl -libs-only-other
Return linker flags, other than the library and path flags, required to
compile against the package.
.It Fl -exists
Return true if all the specified packages are installed.
This is the default if no other option is given.
.It Fl -uninstalled
Allow packages not controlled by
.Nm
to be used.
.It Fl -static
Return the compiler and/or linker flags required for static linking.
.It Fl -atleast-version Ar version
Exit with error if the specified package's version is not greater than
or equal to the specified version.
.It Fl -modversion
Fetch package version.
If no package is given,
.Nm
returns its own version.
.It Fl -variable Ar name
Fetch the value of the named variable.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PKG_CONFIG_PATH
.It Ev PKG_CONFIG_PATH
This can be used to specify a colon-separated list of paths to search for
package files.
If given, this list of paths is prepended to the standard search path.
