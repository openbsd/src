.Sh NAME
.Nm calendar
.Nd reminder service
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm calendar
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl A Ar num
.Op Fl B Ar num
.Op Fl t Ar [[[cc]yy][mm]]dd
.Op Fl f Ar calendarfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm calendar
utility checks the current directory or the directory specified by the
.Ev CALENDAR_DIR
environment variable for a file named
.Pa calendar
and displays lines that begin with either today's date
or tomorrow's.
On Fridays, events on Friday through Monday are displayed.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Process the ``calendar'' files of all users and mail the results
to them.
This requires super-user privileges.
.It Fl A Ar num
Print lines from today and next
.Ar num
days (forward, future).
.It Fl B Ar num
Print lines from today and previous
.Ar num
days (backward, past).
.It Fl f Pa calendarfile
Use
.Pa calendarfile
as the default calendar file.
.It Fl t Ar [[[cc]yy][mm]]dd
Act like the specified value is ``today'' instead of using the current date.
.El
.Pp
To handle calendars in your national code table you can specify
.Dq LANG=<locale_name>
in the calendar file as early as possible. To handle national Easter
names in the calendars,
.Dq Easter=<national_name>
(for Catholic Easter) or
.Dq Paskha=<national_name>
(for Orthodox Easter) can be used.
.Pp
Other lines should begin with a month and day.
They may be entered in almost any format, either numeric or as character
strings.
If proper locale is set, national months and weekdays
names can be used.
A single asterisk (`*') matches every month.
A day without a month matches that day of every week.
A month without a day matches the first of that month.
Two numbers default to the month followed by the day.
Lines with leading tabs default to the last entered date, allowing
multiple line specifications for a single date.
``Easter'' (may be followed by a positive or negative integer) is
Easter for this year.
``Paskha'' (may be followed by a positive or negative integer) is
Orthodox Easter for this year.
Weekdays may be followed by ``-4'' ... ``+5'' (aliases
last, first, second, third, fourth) for moving events like
``the last Monday in April''.
.Pp
By convention, dates followed by an asterisk
.Pq Sq *
are not fixed, i.e., change
from year to year.
.Pp
Day descriptions start after the first <tab> character in the line;
if the line does not contain a <tab> character, it isn't printed out.
If the first character in the line is a <tab> character, it is treated as
continue of previous description.
.Pp
The ``calendar'' file is preprocessed by
.Xr cpp 1 ,
allowing the inclusion of shared files such as company holidays or
meetings.
If the shared file is not referenced by a full pathname,
.Xr cpp 1
searches in the current (or home) directory first, and then in the
directory
.Pa /usr/share/calendar .
Empty lines and lines protected by the C commenting syntax
.Pq Li /* ... */
are ignored.
.Pp
Some possible calendar entries (<tab> characters are highlighted by a
\fB\et\fR sequence):
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
LANG=C
Easter=Ostern

#include <calendar.usholiday>
#include <calendar.birthday>

6/15\fB\et\fRJune 15 (if ambiguous, will default to month/day).

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm calendar
program previously selected lines which had the correct date anywhere
in the line.
This is no longer true, the date is only recognized when it occurs
at the beginning of a line.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v7 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm calendar
doesn't handle Jewish holidays or moon phases.
.br
When used with the
.Fl A
and
.Fl B
flags,
.Nm calendar
will only print the first instance of periodic events.  When using the
.Fl A
and   
.Fl B
flags to cross a year boundary,
.Nm calendar
will use calculate the date of easter in the current year, not the next year.
