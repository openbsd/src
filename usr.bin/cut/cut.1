.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility selects portions of each line (as specified by
.Ar list )
from each
.Ar file
(or the standard input by default), and writes them to the
standard output.
The items specified by
.Ar list
can be in terms of column position or in terms of fields delimited
by a special character.
Column numbering starts from 1.
.Pp
.Ar list
is a comma or whitespace separated set of numbers and/or
number ranges.
Number ranges consist of a number, a dash
.Pq Sq \- ,
and a second number
which select the fields or columns from the first number to the second,
inclusive.
Numbers or number ranges may be preceded by a dash, which selects all
fields or columns from 1 to the first number.
Numbers or number ranges may be followed by a dash, which selects all
fields or columns from the last number to the end of the line.
Numbers and number ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any order.
It is not an error to select fields or columns not present in the
input line.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar list
The
.Ar list
specifies byte positions.
.It Fl c Ar list
The
.Ar list
specifies character positions.
.It Fl d Ar delim
Use the first character of
.Ar delim
as the field delimiter character.
The default is the
.Aq TAB
character.
.It Fl f Ar list
The
.Ar list
specifies fields, separated by the field delimiter character.
The selected fields are output,
separated by the field delimiter character.
.It Fl n
Do not split multi-byte characters.
.It Fl s
Suppresses lines with no field delimiter characters.
Unless specified, lines with no delimiters are passed through unmodified.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std cut
.Sh EXAMPLES
Extract login names and shells from the system
.Xr passwd 5
file as
.Dq name:shell
pairs:
.Pp
.Dl "$ cut -d : -f 1,7 /etc/passwd"
.Pp
Show the names and login times of logged in users:
.Pp
.Dl "$ who | cut -c 1-16,26-38"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr paste 1
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Sh CAVEATS
The current implementation does not support multi-byte characters.
Consequently
.Fl c
does the same as
.Fl b ,
and
.Fl n
has no effect.
