The following TELNET options are supported:
	
	LINEMODE:
		The LINEMODE option is supported as per RFC1116.  The
		FORWARDMASK option is not currently supported.

	BINARY: The client has the ability to turn on/off the BINARY
		option in each direction.  Turning on BINARY from
		server to client causes the LITOUT bit to get set in
		the terminal driver on both ends,  turning on BINARY
		from the client to the server causes the PASS8 bit
		to get set in the terminal driver on both ends.

	TERMINAL-TYPE:
		This is supported as per RFC1091.  On the server side,
		when a terminal type is received, termcap/terminfo
		is consulted to determine if it is a known terminal
		type.  It keeps requesting terminal types until it
		gets one that it recongnizes, or hits the end of the
		list.  The server side looks up the entry in the
		termcap/terminfo data base, and generates a list of
		names which it then passes one at a time to each
		request for a terminal type, duplicating the last
		entry in the list before cycling back to the beginning.

	NAWS:	The Negotiate about Window Size, as per RFC 1073.

	TERMINAL-SPEED:
		Implemented as per RFC 1079

	TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL:
		Implemented as per RFC 1080

	TIMING-MARK:
		As per RFC 860

	SGA:	As per RFC 858

	ECHO:	As per RFC 857

	LOGOUT: As per RFC 727

	STATUS:
		The server will send its current status upon
		request.  It does not ask for the clients status.
		The client will request the servers current status
		from the "send getstatus" command.

	ENVIRON:
		This option is currently being defined by the IETF
		Telnet Working Group, and an RFC has not yet been
		issued, but should be in the near future...

	X-DISPLAY-LOCATION:
		This functionality can be done through the ENVIRON
		option, it is added here for completeness.
