.Sh BUGS
String escape sequences are not recognized so things such as
.Pp
.Li \&" foo \&"\&(01 02\&) \&"n \&"
.Pp
will result in the string
.Pp
.Dq  foo \&"\&(01 02\&) \&"n .
.Pp
Hexadecimal numbers with dots in them such as
.Li 100.0000
are not parsed.
.Pp
Permissions on the output file are often incorrect.
.Pp
Output to the standard output device can cause problems.
