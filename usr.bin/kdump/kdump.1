.Sh NAME
.Nm kdump
.Nd display kernel trace data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kdump
.Bk -words
.Op Fl dlnRrTXx
.Op Fl e Ar emulation
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl m Ar maxdata
.Op Fl p Ar pid
.Op Fl t Op ceinsw
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays the kernel trace files produced with
.Xr ktrace 1
in human-readable format.
By default, the file
.Pa ktrace.out
in the current directory is displayed, unless overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Display all numbers in decimal.
By default, values are printed out in hexadecimal.
.It Fl e Ar emulation
Interpret system call maps assuming the named emulation instead of
.Qq bsd .
For example, to view trace output from a Linux binary, use
.Fl e Ar linux .
.It Fl f Ar file
Display the specified file instead of
.Pa ktrace.out .
.It Fl l
Loop reading the trace file, once the end-of-file is reached, waiting for
more data.
.It Fl m Ar maxdata
Display at most
.Ar maxdata
bytes when decoding I/O.
.It Fl n
Suppress ad hoc translations.
Normally
.Nm
tries to decode many system calls into a more human-readable format.
For example,
.Xr ioctl 2
values are replaced with the macro name and
.Va errno
values are replaced with the
.Xr strerror 3
string.
Suppressing this feature yields a more consistent output format and is
easily amenable to further processing.
.It Fl p Ar pid
Show output only for the
.Ar pid
specified.
.It Fl R
Display relative timestamps (time since previous entry).
.It Fl r
When decoding STRU records, display structure members such as UIDs,
GIDs, dates etc. symbolically instead of numerically.
.It Fl T
Display absolute timestamps for each entry (seconds since the Epoch).
.It Fl t Op ceinstw
Selects which tracepoints to display.
See the
.Fl t
option of
.Xr ktrace 1
for the definitions of the flags.
.It Fl X
Display I/O data with hexadecimal data and printable ASCII characters
side by side.
.It Fl x
Display I/O data in hexadecimal.

.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ktrace.out -compact
