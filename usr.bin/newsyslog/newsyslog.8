.Os OpenBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm newsyslog
.Nd maintain system log files to manageable sizes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm newsyslog
.Op Fl vmnr
.Op Fl f Ar configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm newsyslog
is a program that should be scheduled to run periodically by
.Xr cron 8 .
When it is executed it archives log files if necessary.  If a log file
is determined to require archiving, 
.Nm newsyslog
rearranges the files so that ``logfile'' is empty, ``logfile.0'' has
the last period's logs in it, ``logfile.1'' has the next to last
period's logs in it, and so on, up to a user-specified number of
archived logs.  Optionally the archived logs can be compressed to save
space. 
.Pp
A log can be archived because of two reasons.  The log file can have
grown bigger than a preset size in kilobytes, or a preset number of
hours may have elapsed since the last log archive.  The granularity of
.Nm newsyslog
is dependent on how often it is scheduled to run in
.Xr cron 8 .
Since the program is quite fast, it may be scheduled to run every hour
without any ill effects.
.Pp
When starting up, 
.Nm newsyslog
reads in a configuration file to determine which logs should be looked
at.  By default, this configuration file is 
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.conf .
Each line of the file contains information about a particular log file
that should be handled by
.Nm newsyslog .
Each line has five mandatory fields and up to three optional fields, with a
whitespace separating each field.  Blank lines or lines beginning with
``#'' are ignored.  The fields of the configuration file are as
follows: 
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
.It logfile name
The full pathname of the system log file to be archived.
.It owner.group of archives (optional)
Specify an ownership and group for the archive file.  The "." is essential,
even if the
.Ar owner
or
.Ar group
field is left blank.  The fields may be numeric, or a name which is looked up
in the system password and group databases.
.It mode of logfile & archives
Octal mode of created log files and archives.
.It number of archives
Specify the number of archives to be kept besides the log file itself.
.It size of archives
When the size of the log file reaches this point, the log file becomes trimmed
as described above.  If this field is replaced by a ``*'', then the size of
the log file is not taken into account when determining when to trim the
log file.
.It archive interval
Specify the time separation between the trimming of the log file.  If this
field is replaced by a ``*'', the number of hours since the last time the
log was trimmed will not be taken into consideration.
.It flags (optional)
The
.Ar flags
field specifies if the archives should have any special processing
done to the archived log files.  The ``Z'' flag will make the archive
files compressed to save space using
.Xr gzip 1
or
.Xr compress 1 ,
depending on compilation options.  The ``B'' flag means that the file is a
binary file, and so the ASCII message which
.Nm newsyslog
inserts to indicate the fact that the logs have been turned over
should not be included.  The ``M'' flag marks this entry as a monitored
log file.
.It monitor notification (optional)
Specify the account that should receive notification messages if this is
a monitored log file.  Notification messages are sent as email; the operator
deserves what they get if they mark the 
.Xr sendmail 8
log file as monitored.
.It pid file (optional)
Specify a file containing the id of a process to send a HUP signal to
instead of
.Pa /var/run/syslog.pid .
.El
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options can be used with
.Nm newsyslog :
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Fl f Ar config-file
Instructs newsyslog to use 
.Ar config-file
instead of
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.conf
for its configuration file.
.It Fl v
Places 
.Nm newsyslog
in verbose mode.  In this mode it will print out each log and its
reasons for either trimming that log or skipping it.
.It Fl n
Causes
.Nm newsyslog 
not to trim the logs, but to print out what it would do if this option
were not specified.
.It Fl r
Removes the restriction that
.Nm newsyslog 
must be running as root.  Of course, 
.Nm newsyslog
will not be able to send a HUP signal to
.Xr syslogd 8 ,
so this option should only be used in debugging.
.It Fl m
Places
.Nm newsyslog
in monitoring mode; only entries marked with an ``M'' in flags are processed,
and notifications sent if any have changed.  Without this option, monitored
entries are not processed.
