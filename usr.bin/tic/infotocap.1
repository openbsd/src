.SH NAME
\fBinfotocap\fR - convert a \fIterminfo\fR description into a \fItermcap\fR description
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBinfotocap\fR [\fB-v\fR\fIn\fR \fIwidth\fR]  [\fB-V\fR] [\fB-1\fR] [\fB-w\fR \fIwidth\fR] \fIfile\fR . . .
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinfotocap\fR looks in \fIfile\fR for \fBterminfo\fR descriptions.  For each
one found, an equivalent \fBtermcap\fR description is written to standard
output.  Terminfo \fBuse\fR capabilities are translated directly to termcap
\fBtc\fR capabilities.
.TP 5
\fB-v\fR
print out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.
.TP 5
\fB-V\fR
print out the version of the program in use on standard error and exit.
.TP 5
\fB-1\fR
cause the fields to print out one to a line.  Otherwise, the fields
will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60
characters.
.TP 5
\fB-w\fR
change the output to \fIwidth\fR characters.
.SH FILES
.TP 20
\*d
Compiled terminal description database.
.SH NOTES
This utility is actually a link to \fItic\fR, running in \fI-C\fR mode.
You can use other \fItic\fR options such as \fB-f\fR and  \fB-x\fR.
