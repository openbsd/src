.Sh NAME
.Nm which
.Nd "locate a program file (or files) in the path"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm which
.Op Fl a
.Op Ar name
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Which
takes a list of names and looks for the files which would be
executed had these names been given as commands.
Each argument is searched for along the user's path.
.Pp
If the
.Fl a
flag is given,
.Nm
will return a list of all matches instead of just the first match.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It 0
All names got successfully resolved.
.It 1
Some names got resolved but not all.
.It 2
No names got resolved.
.It -1
A system error occurred.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A diagnostic is given if an executable file with the argument
name was not found in the path.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PATH
.It Ev PATH
.Nm
uses the environment variable
.Ev PATH
as a colon-separated list of directories in which to find executables.
If
.Ev PATH
is not set, and the given name is not a fully-qualified
or relative pathname,
.Nm
will fail.
.El
.Sh CAVEATS

.Nm
command formerly was a
.Xr csh 1
script and could expand aliases.
.Xr csh 1
now has a built-in
.Nm
comand so this version is intended for use
with other shells like
.Xr sh 1 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr whereis 1 ,
.Xr environ 7
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
