.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sendbug
.Nd report a bug in OpenBSD
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DEP
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to submit problem reports (PRs) to the
.Ox
bugs database.
A template PR is opened in a text editor
with some system information already filled in,
such as machine architecture,
.Xr dmesg 8 ,
.Xr usbdevs 8 ,
.Xr pcidump 8 ,
and
.Xr acpidump 8 .
The
.Xr pcidump 8
and
.Xr acpidump 8
output are important for ACPI development and can only be included if
.Nm
is run as root.
.Pp
Fields enclosed in
.Sq \*(Lt\*(Gt
should be completed by the user.
Once the PR is filled out,
the user exits the editor and is presented with a choice:
a)bort, e)dit, or s)end.
If abort is selected,
the report is not deleted and the pathname of the report is printed.
If edit is selected,
the user is given a chance to re-edit the report.
.Pp
If send is selected,
the report is mailed to the bugs database,
with a Cc to the author.
An auto-generated reply will be sent
confirming the mail has been received.
Any follow up mail to the PR
should keep the same mail subject.
.Pp
The status of bug reports can be followed by checking the
.Mt bugs@openbsd.org
mailing list archive available at
.Lk http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-bugs .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Do not attach
.Xr dmesg 8 ,
.Xr usbdevs 8 ,
.Xr pcidump 8 ,
and
.Xr acpidump 8
output to the report.
This information is very helpful in reports,
but may contain sensitive information about the sender.
This flag helps protect users' privacy in those cases.
.It Fl E
The
.Xr acpidump 8
output includes base64 encoded files.
This flag causes
.Nm
to read a PR from the standard input, decode the files,
and write them into the current directory.
.It Fl P
Generate and print the template with system information filled out.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ds

nor

.Xr vi 1 .
.It Ev PR_FORM
Filename of PR form to use instead of using the built-in form.
Such a PR form can be partially pre-completed to make the
process faster.
