.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sendbug
.Nd report a bug in
.Ox
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DLPV
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to submit problem reports (PRs) to the
.Ox
bugs database.
A template PR is opened in a text editor
with some system information,
such as machine architecture,
already filled in,
and a
.Xr dmesg 8
attached.
Fields enclosed in
.Sq \*(Lt\*(Gt
should be completed by the user.
.Pp
Once the PR is filled out,
the user exits the editor and is presented with a choice:
a)bort, e)dit, or s)end.
If abort is selected,
the report is not deleted and the pathname of the report is printed.
If edit is selected,
the user is given a chance to re-edit the report.
.Pp
If send is selected,
the report is mailed to the bugs database,
with a Cc to the author.
An auto-generated reply will be sent
confirming the mail has been received.
Any follow up mail to the PR
should keep the same mail subject.
.Pp
The bugs database can be queried using the online bug tracking system
available at
.Pa http://www.openbsd.org/query-pr.html .
This allows users to search for PRs based on either PR number
or content.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Do not attach a
.Xr dmesg 8
to report.
The
.Xr dmesg 8
output is very helpful in reports,
but may contain sensitive information about the sender.
This flag helps protect users' privacy in those cases.
.It Fl L
Print the list of available categories.
.It Fl P
Generate and print the template with system information filled out.
.It Fl V
Print the version number.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev EDITOR , VISUAL

nor

are set,

.Xr vi 1 .
.It Ev PR_FORM
Filename of PR form to use instead of using the built-in form.
Such a PR form can be partially pre-completed to make the
process faster.
