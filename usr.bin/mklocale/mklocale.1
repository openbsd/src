.Nm mklocale

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mklocale
.Op Fl d
.Op Ar src-file
.Ar language/LC_CTYPE
.Nm mklocale
.Op Fl d
.Fl o
.Ar language/LC_CTYPE
.Ar src-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mklocale
utility reads an
.Dv LC_CTYPE
source file from standard input and produces an
.Dv LC_CTYPE
binary file on standard output suitable for placement in
.Pa /usr/share/locale/\*(Ltlanguage\*(Gt/LC_CTYPE .
.Pp
The format of
.Ar src-file
is quite simple:
it consists of a series of lines which start with a keyword and have
associated data following.
C-style comments are used
to place comments in the file.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Turns on debugging messages.
.It Fl o
Specify an output file.
.El
.Pp
Besides the keywords which will be listed below,
the following are valid tokens in
.Ar src-file :
.Bl -tag -width literal
.It Dv RUNE
A
.Dv RUNE
may be any of the following:
.Bl -tag -width 0x[0-9a-z]*
.It Ar 'x'
The ASCII character
.Ar x .
.It Ar '\ex'
The ANSI C character
.Ar \ex
where
.Ar \ex
is one of
.Dv \ea ,
.Dv \eb ,
.Dv \ef ,
.Dv \en ,
.Dv \er ,
.Dv \et ,
or
.Dv \ev .
.It Ar 0x[0-9a-z]*
A hexadecimal number representing a rune code.
.It Ar 0[0-7]*
An octal number representing a rune code.
.It Ar [1-9][0-9]*
A decimal number representing a rune code.
.El
.It Dv STRING
A string enclosed in double quotes (").
.It Dv THRU
Either
.Sq ...
or
.Sq - .
Used to indicate ranges.
.It Ar literal
The follow characters are taken literally:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXX -compact
.It Dv "\*(Lt \*(Ba ( \*(Ba ["
Used to start a mapping.
All are equivalent.
.It Dv "\*(Gt \*(Ba ) \*(Ba ]"
Used to end a mapping.
All are equivalent.
.It Dv :
Used as a delimiter in mappings.
.El
.El
.Pp
Key words which should only appear once are:
.Bl -tag -width PHONOGRAM
.It Dv ENCODING
Followed by a
.Dv STRING
which indicates the encoding mechanism to be used for this locale.
The current encodings are:
.Bl -tag -width NONE
.It Dv NONE
No translation and the default.
.It Dv UTF2
.Dv "Universal character set Transformation Format"
adopted from Plan 9 from Bell Labs.
.It Dv EUC
.Dv EUC
encoding as used by several
vendors of
.Ux
systems.
.El
.It Dv VARIABLE
This keyword must be followed by a single tab or space character,
after which encoding specific data is placed.
Currently only the
.Dv "EUC"
encoding requires variable data.
.\" See
.\" .Xr euc 4
.\" for further details.
.It Dv INVALID
A single
.Dv RUNE
follows and is used as the invalid rune for this locale.
.El
.Pp
The following keywords may appear multiple times and have the following
format for data:
.Bl -tag -width "XXRUNE1 THRU RUNEn : RUNE2XX" -offset indent
.It Aq Dv RUNE1 RUNE2
.Dv RUNE1
is mapped to
.Dv RUNE2 .
.It Aq Dv RUNE1 THRU RUNEn : RUNE2
Runes
.Dv RUNE1
through
.Dv RUNEn
are mapped to
.Dv RUNE2
through
.Dv RUNE2
.El
.Bl -tag -width PHONOGRAM
.It Dv MAPLOWER
Defines the tolower mappings.
.Dv RUNE2
is the lower case representation of
.Dv RUNE1 .
.It Dv MAPUPPER
Defines the toupper mappings.
.Dv RUNE2
is the upper case representation of
.Dv RUNE1 .
.It Dv TODIGIT
Defines a map from runes to their digit value.
.Dv RUNE2
is the integer value represented by
.Dv RUNE1 .
For example, the ASCII character
.Sq 0
would map to the decimal value 0.
Only values up to 255 are allowed.
.El
.Pp
The following keywords may appear multiple times and have the following
format for data:
.Bl -tag -width "RUNE1 THRU RUNEn"
.It Dv RUNE
This rune has the property defined by the keyword.
.It Dv "RUNE1 THRU RUNEn"
All the runes between and including
.Dv RUNE1
and
.Dv RUNEn
have the property defined by the keyword.
.El
.Bl -tag -width PHONOGRAM
.It Dv ALPHA
Defines runes which are alphabetic, printable, and graphic.
.It Dv CONTROL
Defines runes which are control characters.
.It Dv DIGIT

.It Dv XDIGIT
Defines runes which are hexadecimal digits, printable, and graphic.
.It Dv BLANK
Defines runes which are blank.
.It Dv PRINT
Defines runes which are printable.
.It Dv IDEOGRAM
Defines runes which are ideograms, printable, and graphic.
.It Dv SPECIAL
Defines runes which are special characters, printable, and graphic.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mklocale
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm mklocale
utility is overly simplistic.
.Pp
We should switch to
.Nm localedef
and its file format, which is more standard.
