.Sh NAME
.Nm mkdep
.Nd construct Makefile dependency list
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mkdep
.Op Fl ap
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Ar flags
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes a set of flags for the C compiler and a list
of C source files as arguments and constructs a set of include
file dependencies which are written into the file
.Pa .depend ,
for use by
.Xr make 1 .
An example of its use in a Makefile might be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
CFLAGS= -O -I../include
SRCS= file1.c file2.c

depend:
	mkdep ${CFLAGS} ${SRCS}
.Ed
.Pp
where the macro SRCS is the list of C source files and the macro
CFLAGS is the list of flags for the C compiler.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Append to the output file,
so that multiple
.Nm mkdep Ns 's
may be run from a single Makefile.
.It Fl f Ar file
Write the include file dependencies to
.Ar file ,
instead of the default
.Pa .depend .
.It Fl p
Cause
.Nm
to produce dependencies of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
program: program.c
.Ed
.Pp
so that subsequent makes will produce
.Ar program
directly from its C module rather than using an intermediate
.Pa \&.o
module.
This is useful for programs whose source is contained in a single
module.
