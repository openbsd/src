.Nm file
.Nd determine file type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bciLsW
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility tests each argument and attempts to determine its type.
Three sets of tests are performed:
.Bl -enum -offset Ds
.It
Filesystem tests, for example if a file is empty, or a special file such as a
socket or named pipe (FIFO).
.It
.Dq Magic
tests for data in particular fixed formats.
These are loaded from the
.Pa /etc/magic
file (or
.Pa ~/.magic
instead if it exists and
.Nm
is not running as root).
The file format is described in
.Xr magic 5 .
.It
Tests for text files such as plain ASCII or C programming language files.
.El
.Pp
The first test which succeeds causes the file type to be printed.
The type will often contain one of the words
.Em text
(contains only printing characters and is probably safe to read on an ASCII
terminal),
.Em executable
(the file contains a compiled executable program)
or
.Em data
meaning anything else.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Do not prepend filenames to output lines.
.It Fl c
Print a summary of the parsed magic file; usually used for debugging.
.It Fl i , -mime , -mime-type
Causes the file command to output MIME type strings rather than the more
traditional human-readable ones.
Thus it may say
.Dq text/plain
rather than
.Dq ASCII text .
.It Fl L
Causes symlinks to be followed.
.It Fl s
Instructs
.Nm
to attempt to read all files, not only those which
.Xr stat 2
reports are ordinary files.
.It Fl W
Display warnings when parsing the magic file or applying its tests.
Usually used for debugging.

There is a large number of contributors to the magic files; many are listed in
the source files.
