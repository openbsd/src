.Sh NAME
.Nm audioctl
.Nd control audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm audioctl
.Op Fl an
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Nm audioctl
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Ar name ...
.Nm audioctl
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays or sets various audio system driver variables.
If a list of variables is present on the command line,
.Nm
prints the current value of those variables for the specified device.
By default,
.Nm
operates on the
.Pa /dev/audioctl
device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "name=valueXX"
.It Fl a
Print all device variables and their current values.
This is the default, if no parameters are given to
.Nm .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative audio control device.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the variable name.
.It Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
Attempt to set the specified variable
.Ar name
to
.Ar value .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width AUDIOCTLDEVICE
.It Ev AUDIOCTLDEVICE
Audio control device to use.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/audioctl
.It Pa /dev/audioctl
default audio control device
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set the playing sampling rate to 11025 you can enter:
.Pp
.Dl $ audioctl play.rate=11025
.Pp
Note that many of the variables that can be inspected and changed
are reset when the
.Pa /dev/audio
device is opened.
This can be circumvented like so:
.Pp
.Dl $ (cat file.au; audioctl -f /dev/audioctl) \*(Gt /dev/audio
or
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
$ (audioctl -f /dev/audioctl play.block_size=1024; cat file.au) \e
	\*(Gt /dev/audio
