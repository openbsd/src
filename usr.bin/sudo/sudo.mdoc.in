.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm sudo
allows a permitted user to execute a
.Ar command
as the superuser or another user, as specified by the
.Em sudoers
file.
The real and effective uid and gid are set to match those of the
target user, as specified in the password database, and the group
vector is initialized based on the group database (unless the
.Fl P
option was specified).
See the
.Sx Command Environment
section below for more details.
.Pp
.Nm sudo
determines who is an authorized user by consulting the file
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers .
By running
.Nm sudo
with the
.Fl v
option, a user can update the time stamp without running a
.Ar command .
If authentication is required,
.Nm sudo
will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable
time limit.
The default password prompt timeout is
.Li @password_timeout@
minutes.
.Pp
When invoked as
.Nm sudoedit ,
the
.Fl e
option (described below), is implied.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl A
Normally, if
.Nm sudo
requires a password, it will read it from the user's terminal.
If the
.Fl A Pq Em askpass
option is specified, a (possibly graphical) helper program is
executed to read the user's password and output the password to the
standard output.
If the
.Ev SUDO_ASKPASS
environment variable is set, it specifies the path to the helper
program.
Otherwise, the value specified by the
.Em askpass
option in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@
is used.
If no askpass program is available,
.Nm sudo
will exit with an error.
.It Fl a Ar type
The
.Fl a Pq Em authentication type
option causes
.Nm sudo
to use the specified authentication type when validating the user,
as allowed by
.Pa /etc/login.conf .
The system administrator may specify a list of sudo-specific
authentication methods by adding an
.Dq auth-sudo
entry in
.Pa /etc/login.conf .
This option is only available on systems that support BSD authentication.
.It Fl b
The
.Fl b Pq Em background
option tells
.Nm sudo
to run the given command in the background.
Note that if you use the
.Fl b
option you cannot use shell job control to manipulate the process.
Most interactive commands will fail to work properly in background
mode.
.It Fl C Ar fd
Normally,
.Nm sudo
will close all open file descriptors other than standard input,
standard output and standard error.
The
.Fl C Pq Em close from
option allows the user to specify a starting point above the standard
error (file descriptor three).
Values less than three are not permitted.
This option is only available when the administrator has enabled the
.Em closefrom_override
option in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ .
.It Fl c Ar class
The
.Fl c Pq Em class
option causes
.Nm sudo
to run the command with resource limits and scheduling priority of
the specified login
.Ar class .
The
.Ar class
argument can be either a class name as defined in
.Pa /etc/login.conf ,
or a single
.Ql \-
character.
If
.Ar class
is
.Cm - ,
the default login class of the target user will be used.
Otherwise, the command must be run as the superuser (user ID 0), or
.Nm sudo
must be run from a shell that is already running as the superuser.
If the command is being run as a login shell, additional
.Pa /etc/login.conf
settings, such as the umask and environment variables, will
be applied, if present.
This option is only available on systems with BSD login classes.
.It Fl E
The
.Fl E Pq Em preserve environment
option will override the
.Em env_reset
option in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ .
It is only available when either the matching command has the
.Li SETENV
tag or the
.Em setenv
option is set in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ .
.Nm sudo
will return an error if the
.Fl E
option is specified and the user does not have permission to preserve
the environment.
.It Fl e
The
.Fl e Pq Em edit
option indicates that, instead of running a command, the user wishes
to edit one or more files.
In lieu of a command, the string "sudoedit" is used when consulting the
.Em sudoers
file.
If the user is authorized by
.Em sudoers ,
the following steps are taken:
.Bl -enum -offset 4
.It
Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the owner
set to the invoking user.
.It
The editor specified by the
.Ev SUDO_EDITOR ,
.Ev VISUAL
or
.Ev EDITOR
environment variables (in that order) is run to edit the temporary files.
If none of
.Ev SUDO_EDITOR ,
.Ev VISUAL
or
.Ev EDITOR
are set, the first program listed in the
.Em editor
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@
option is used.
.It
If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back to
their original location and the temporary versions are removed.
.El
.Pp
If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.
Note that unlike most commands run by
.Em sudo ,
the editor is run with the invoking user's environment unmodified.
If, for some reason,
.Nm sudo
is unable to update a file with its edited version, the user will
receive a warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary
file.
.It Fl g Ar group
Normally,
.Nm sudo
runs a command with the primary group set to the one specified by
the password database for the user the command is being run as (by
default, root).
The
.Fl g Pq Em group
option causes
.Nm sudo
to run the command with the primary group set to
.Ar group
instead.
To specify a gid instead of a group name, use
.Ar #gid .
When running commands as a
.Em gid ,
many shells require that the
.Ql #
be escaped with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e .
If no
.Fl u
option is specified, the command will be run as the invoking user
(not root).
In either case, the primary group will be set to
.Em group .
.It Fl H
The
.Fl H Pq Em HOME
option option sets the
.Ev HOME
environment variable to the home directory of the target user (root
by default) as specified by the password database.
The default handling of the
.Ev HOME
environment variable depends on
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@
settings.
By default,
.Nm sudo
will not modify
.Ev HOME
(see
.Em set_home
and
.Em always_set_home
in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ ) .
.It Fl h
The
.Fl h Pq Em help
option causes
.Nm sudo
to print a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.It Fl i Op Ar command
The
.Fl i Pq Em simulate initial login
option runs the shell specified by the password database entry of
the target user as a login shell.
This means that login-specific resource files such as
.Pa .profile
or
.Pa .login
will be read by the shell.
If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution
via the shell's
.Fl c
option.
If no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.
.Nm sudo
attempts to change to that user's home directory before running the
shell.
It also initializes the environment to a minimal
set of variables, similar to what is present when a user logs in.
The
.Sx Command Environment
section below documents in detail how the
.Fl i
option affects the environment in which a command is run.
.It Fl K
The
.Fl K Pq sure Em kill
option is like
.Fl k
except that it removes the user's time stamp file entirely and
may not be used in conjunction with a command or other option.
This option does not require a password.
.It Fl k Op Ar command
When used alone, the
.Fl k Pq Em kill
option to
.Nm sudo
invalidates the user's time stamp file.
The next time
.Nm sudo
is run a password will be required.
This option does not require a password and was added to allow a
user to revoke
.Nm sudo
permissions from a
.Pa .logout
file.
.Pp
When used in conjunction with a command or an option that may require
a password, the
.Fl k
option will cause
.Nm sudo
to ignore the user's time stamp file.
As a result,
.Nm sudo
will prompt for a password (if one is required by
.Em sudoers )
and will not update the user's time stamp file.
.It Fl L
The
.Fl L Pq Em list defaults
option will list the parameters that
may be set in a
.Em Defaults
line along with a short description for each.
This option will be removed from a future version of
.Nm sudo .
.It Fl l Op Ar command
If no
.Ar command
is specified, the
.Fl l Pq Em list
option will list the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the
invoking user (or the user specified by the
.Fl U
option) on the current host.
If a
.Ar command
is specified and is permitted by
.Em sudoers ,
the fully-qualified
path to the command is displayed along with any command line
arguments.
If
.Ar command
is specified but not allowed,
.Nm sudo
will exit with a status value of 1.
If
.Fl l
is specified multiple times, a longer list format is used.
.It Fl n
The
.Fl n Pq Em non-interactive
option prevents
.Nm sudo
from prompting the user for a password.
If a password is required for the command to run,
.Nm sudo
will display an error message and exit.
.It Fl P
The
.Fl P Pq Em preserve group vector
option causes
.Nm sudo
to preserve the invoking user's group vector unaltered.
By default,
.Nm sudo
will initialize the group vector to the list of groups the
target user is in.
The real and effective group IDs, however, are still set to match
the target user.
.It Fl p Ar prompt
The
.Fl p Pq Em prompt
option allows you to override the default password prompt and use
a custom one.
The following percent
.Pq Ql %
escapes are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Li %H
expanded to the host name including the domain name (on if the
machine's host name is fully qualified or the
.Em fqdn
option is set in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ )
.It Li %h
expanded to the local host name without the domain name
.It Li %p
expanded to the name of the user whose password is being requested
(respects the
.Em rootpw ,
.Em targetpw ,
and
.Em runaspw
flags in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ )
.It Li \&%U
expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as
(defaults to root unless the
.Fl u
option is also specified)
.It Li %u
expanded to the invoking user's login name
.It Li %%
two consecutive
.Ql %
characters are collapsed into a single
.Ql %
character
.El
.Pp
The prompt specified by the
.Fl p
option will override the system password prompt on systems that
support PAM unless the
.Em passprompt_override
flag is disabled in
.Em sudoers .
.It Fl S
The
.Fl S Pq Em stdin
option causes
.Nm sudo
to read the password from the standard input instead of the terminal
device.
The password must be followed by a newline character.
.It Fl s Op Ar command
The
.Fl s Pq Em shell
option runs the shell specified by the
.Ev SHELL
environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified in the
password database.
If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution
via the shell's
.Fl c
option.
If no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.
.It Fl U Ar user
The
.Fl U Pq other Em user
option is used in conjunction with the
.Fl l
option to specify the user whose privileges should be listed.
Only root or a user with the
.Li ALL
privilege on the current host may use this option.
.It Fl u Ar user
The
.Fl u Pq Em user
option causes
.Nm sudo
to run the specified command as a user other than
.Em root .
To specify a uid instead of a user name, use
.Ar #uid .
When running commands as a
.Em uid ,
many shells require that the
.Ql #
be escaped with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e .
Note that if the
.Em targetpw
Defaults option is set (see
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ ) ,
it is not possible to run commands with a uid not listed in the
password database.
.It Fl V
The
.Fl V Pq Em version
option causes
.Nm sudo
to print its version string and exit.
If the invoking user is already root the
.Fl V
option will display the arguments passed to configure when
.Nm sudo
was built as well a list of the defaults
.Nm sudo
was compiled with as well as the machine's local network addresses.
.It Fl v
When given the
.Fl v Pq Em validate
option,
.Nm sudo
will update the user's time stamp file, authenticating the user's
password if necessary.
This extends the
.Nm sudo
timeout for another
.Li @timeout@
minutes (or whatever the timeout is set to in
.Em sudoers )
but does not run a command.
.It Fl -
The
.Fl -
option indicates that
.Nm sudo
should stop processing command line arguments.
.El
.Pp
Environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed
on the command line in the form of
.Ar VAR Ns No = Ns Ar value ,
e.g.\&
.Ev LD_LIBRARY_PATH Ns = Ns Pa /usr/local/pkg/lib .
Variables passed on the command line are subject to the same
restrictions as normal environment variables with one important
exception.
If the
.Em setenv
option is set in
.Em sudoers ,
the command to be run has the
.Li SETENV
tag set or the command matched is
.Li ALL ,
the user may set variables that would otherwise be forbidden.
See
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@
for more information.
.Ss Authentication and Logging
.Nm sudo
requires that most users authenticate themselves by default.
A password is not required
if the invoking user is root, if the target user is the same as the
invoking user, or if the authentication has been disabled for the
user or command in the
.Em sudoers
file.
Unlike
.Xr su 1 ,
when
.Nm sudo
requires
authentication, it validates the invoking user's credentials, not
the target user's (or root's) credentials.
This can be changed via
the
.Em rootpw ,
.Em targetpw
and
.Em runaspw
Defaults entries in
.Em sudoers .
.Pp
If a user who is not listed in
.Em sudoers
tries to run a command via
.Nm sudo ,
mail is sent to the proper authorities.
The address
used for such mail is configurable via the
.Em mailto
.Em sudoers
Defaults entry and defaults to
.Li @mailto@ .
.Pp
Note that mail will not be sent if an unauthorized user tries to
run
.Nm sudo
with the
.Fl l
or
.Fl v
option.
This allows users to
determine for themselves whether or not they are allowed to use
.Nm sudo .
.Pp
If
.Nm sudo
is run by root and the
.Ev SUDO_USER
environment variable
is set, its value will be used to determine who the actual user is.
This can be used by a user to log commands
through
.Nm sudo
even when a root shell has been invoked.
It also
allows the
.Fl e
option to remain useful even when invoked via a
sudo-run script or program.
Note, however, that the
.Em sudoers
lookup is still done for root, not the user specified by
.Ev SUDO_USER .
.Pp
.Nm sudo
uses time stamp files for credential caching.
Once a
user has been authenticated, the time stamp is updated and the user
may then use sudo without a password for a short period of time
.Po
.Li @timeout@
minutes unless overridden by the
.Em timeout
option
.Pc .
By default,
.Nm sudo
uses a tty-based time stamp which means that
there is a separate time stamp for each of a user's login sessions.
The
.Em tty_tickets
option can be disabled to force the use of a
single time stamp for all of a user's sessions.
.Pp
.Nm sudo
can log both successful and unsuccessful attempts (as well
as errors) to
.Xr syslog 3 ,
a log file, or both.
By default,
.Nm sudo
will log via
.Xr syslog 3
but this is changeable via the
.Em syslog
and
.Em logfile
Defaults settings.
.Pp
.Nm sudo
also supports logging a command's input and output
streams.
I/O logging is not on by default but can be enabled using
the
.Em log_input
and
.Em log_output
Defaults flags as well as the
.Li LOG_INPUT
and
.Li LOG_OUTPUT
command tags.
.Ss Command Environment
Since environment variables can influence program behavior,
.Nm sudo
provides a means to restrict which variables from the user's
environment are inherited by the command to be run.
There are two
distinct ways
.Em sudoers
can be configured to handle with environment variables.
.Pp
By default, the
.Em env_reset
option is enabled.
This causes commands
to be executed with a new, minimal environment.
On AIX (and Linux
systems without PAM), the environment is initialized with the
contents of the
.Pa /etc/environment
file.
On BSD systems, if the
.Em use_loginclass
option is enabled, the environment is initialized
based on the
.Em path
and
.Em setenv
settings in
.Pa /etc/login.conf .
The new environment contains the
.Ev TERM ,
.Ev PATH ,
.Ev HOME ,
.Ev MAIL ,
.Ev SHELL ,
.Ev LOGNAME ,
.Ev USER ,
.Ev USERNAME
and
.Ev SUDO_*
variables
in addition to variables from the invoking process permitted by the
.Em env_check
and
.Em env_keep
options.
This is effectively a whitelist
for environment variables.
.Pp
If, however, the
.Em env_reset
option is disabled, any variables not
explicitly denied by the
.Em env_check
and
.Em env_delete
options are
inherited from the invoking process.
In this case,
.Em env_check
and
.Em env_delete
behave like a blacklist.
Since it is not possible
to blacklist all potentially dangerous environment variables, use
of the default
.Em env_reset
behavior is encouraged.
.Pp
In all cases, environment variables with a value beginning with
.Li ()
are removed as they could be interpreted as
.Sy bash
functions.
The list of environment variables that
.Nm sudo
allows or denies is
contained in the output of
.Dq Li sudo -V
when run as root.
.Pp
Note that the dynamic linker on most operating systems will remove
variables that can control dynamic linking from the environment of
setuid executables, including
.Nm sudo .
Depending on the operating
system this may include
.Ev _RLD* ,
.Ev DYLD_* ,
.Ev LD_* ,
.Ev LDR_* ,
.Ev LIBPATH ,
.Ev SHLIB_PATH ,
and others.
These type of variables are
removed from the environment before
.Nm sudo
even begins execution
and, as such, it is not possible for
.Nm sudo
to preserve them.
.Pp
As a special case, if
.Nm sudo Ns 's
.Fl i
option (initial login) is
specified,
.Nm sudo
will initialize the environment regardless
of the value of
.Em env_reset .
The
.Ev DISPLAY ,
.Ev PATH
and
.Ev TERM
variables remain unchanged;
.Ev HOME ,
.Ev MAIL ,
.Ev SHELL ,
.Ev USER ,
and
.Ev LOGNAME
are set based on the target user.
On AIX (and Linux
systems without PAM), the contents of
.Pa /etc/environment
are also
included.
On BSD systems, if the
.Em use_loginclass
option is
enabled, the
.Em path
and
.Em setenv
variables in
.Pa /etc/login.conf
are also applied.
All other environment variables are removed.
.Pp
Finally, if the
.Em env_file
option is defined, any variables present
in that file will be set to their specified values as long as they
would not conflict with an existing environment variable.
.Sh EXIT VALUE
Upon successful execution of a program, the exit status from
.Em sudo
will simply be the exit status of the program that was executed.
.Pp
Otherwise,
.Nm sudo
exits with a value of 1 if there is a configuration/permission
problem or if
.Nm sudo
cannot execute the given command.
In the latter case the error string is printed to the standard error.
If
.Nm sudo
cannot
.Xr stat 2
one or more entries in the user's
.Ev PATH ,
an error is printed on stderr.
(If the directory does not exist or if it is not really a directory,
the entry is ignored and no error is printed.)
This should not happen under normal circumstances.
The most common reason for
.Xr stat 2
to return
.Dq permission denied
is if you are running an automounter and one of the directories in
your
.Ev PATH
is on a machine that is currently unreachable.
.Sh LOG FORMAT
.Nm sudo
can log events using either
.Xr syslog 3
or a simple log file.
In each case the log format is almost identical.
.Ss Accepted command log entries
Commands that sudo runs are logged using the following format (split
into multiple lines for readability):
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
date hostname progname: username : TTY=ttyname ; PWD=cwd ; \e
    USER=runasuser ; GROUP=runasgroup ; TSID=logid ; \e
    ENV=env_vars COMMAND=command
.Ed
.Pp
Where the fields are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It date
The date the command was run.
Typically, this is in the format
.Dq MMM, DD, HH:MM:SS .
If logging via
.Xr syslog 3 ,
the actual date format is controlled by the syslog daemon.
If logging to a file and the
.Em log_year
option is enabled,
the date will also include the year.
.It hostname
The name of the host
.Nm sudo
was run on.
This field is only present when logging via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It progname
The name of the program, usually
.Em sudo
or
.Em sudoedit .
This field is only present when logging via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It username
The login name of the user who ran
.Nm sudo .
.It ttyname
The short name of the terminal (e.g.\&
.Dq console ,
.Dq tty01 ,
or
.Dq pts/0 )
.Nm sudo
was run on, or
.Dq unknown
if there was no terminal present.
.It cwd
The current working directory that
.Nm sudo
was run in.
.It runasuser
The user the command was run as.
.It runasgroup
The group the command was run as if one was specified on the command line.
.It logid
An I/O log identifier that can be used to replay the command's output.
This is only present when the
.Em log_input
or
.Em log_output
option is enabled.
.It env_vars
A list of environment variables specified on the command line,
if specified.
.It command
The actual command that was executed.
.El
.Pp
Messages are logged using the locale specified by
.Em sudoers_locale ,
which defaults to the
.Dq Li C
locale.
.Ss Denied command log entries
If the user is not allowed to run the command, the reason for the denial
will follow the user name.
Possible reasons include:
.Bl -tag -width 4
.It user NOT in sudoers
The user is not listed in the
.Em sudoers
file.
.It user NOT authorized on host
The user is listed in the
.Em sudoers
file but is not allowed to run commands on the host.
.It command not allowed
The user is listed in the
.Em sudoers
file for the host but they are not allowed to run the specified command.
.It 3 incorrect password attempts
The user failed to enter their password after 3 tries.
The actual number of tries will vary based on the number of
failed attempts and the value of the
.Em passwd_tries
.Em sudoers
option.
.It a password is required
The
.Fl n
option was specified but a password was required.
.It sorry, you are not allowed to set the following environment variables
The user specified environment variables on the command line that
were not allowed by
.Em sudoers .
.El
.Ss Error log entries
If an error occurs,
.Nm sudo
will log a message and, in most cases, send a message to the
administrator via email.
Possible errors include:
.Bl -tag -width 4
.It parse error in @sysconfdir@/sudoers near line N
.Nm sudo
encountered an error when parsing the specified file.
In some cases, the actual error may be one line above or below the
line number listed, depending on the type of error.
.It problem with defaults entries
The
.Em sudoers
file contains one or more unknown Defaults settings.
This does not prevent
.Nm sudo
from running, but the
.Em sudoers
file should be checked using
.Nm visudo .
.It timestamp owner (username): \&No such user
The time stamp directory owner, as specified by the
.Em timestampowner
setting, could not be found in the password database.
.It unable to open/read @sysconfdir@/sudoers
The
.Em sudoers
file could not be opened for reading.
This can happen when the
.Em sudoers
file is located on a remote file system that maps user ID 0 to
a different value.
Normally,
.Nm sudo
tries to open
.Em sudoers
using group permissions to avoid this problem.
.It unable to stat @sysconfdir@/sudoers
The
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers
file is missing.
.It @sysconfdir@/sudoers is not a regular file
The
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers
file exists but is not a regular file or symbolic link.
.It @sysconfdir@/sudoers is owned by uid N, should be 0

.Ss Notes on logging via syslog
By default,
.Em sudoers
logs messages via
.Xr syslog 3 .
The
.Em date ,
.Em hostname ,
and
.Em progname
fields are added by the syslog daemon, not
.Em sudoers
itself.
As such, they may vary in format on different systems.
.Pp
On most systems,
.Xr syslog 3
has a relatively small log buffer.
To prevent the command line arguments from being truncated,
.Nm sudo
will split up log messages that are larger than 960 characters
(not including the date, hostname, and the string
.Dq sudo ) .
When a message is split, additional parts will include the string
.Dq Pq command continued
after the user name and before the continued command line arguments.
.Ss Notes on logging to a file
If the
.Em logfile
option is set,
.Em sudoers
will log to a local file, such as
.Pa /var/log/sudo .
When logging to a file,
.Em sudoers
uses a format similar to
.Xr syslog 3 ,
with a few important differences:
.Bl -enum
.It
The
.Em progname
and
.Em hostname
fields are not present.
.It
If the
.Em log_year
.Em sudoers
option is enabled,
the date will also include the year.
.It
Lines that are longer than
.Em loglinelen
characters (80 by default) are word-wrapped and continued on the
next line with a four character indent.
This makes entries easier to read for a human being, but makes it
more difficult to use
.Xr grep 1
on the log files.
If the
.Em loglinelen
.Em sudoers
option is set to 0 (or negated with a
.Ql \&! ) ,
word wrap will be disabled.

.Sh SECURITY NOTES
.Nm sudo
tries to be safe when executing external commands.
.Pp
To prevent command spoofing,
.Nm sudo
checks "." and "" (both denoting current directory) last when
searching for a command in the user's
.Ev PATH
(if one or both are in the
.Ev PATH ) .
Note, however, that the actual
.Ev PATH
environment variable is
.Em not
modified and is passed unchanged to the program that
.Nm sudo
executes.
.Pp
.Nm sudo
will check the ownership of its time stamp directory
.Po
.Pa @timedir@
by default
.Pc
and ignore the directory's contents if it is not owned by root or
if it is writable by a user other than root.
On systems that allow non-root users to give away files via
.Xr chown 2 ,
if the time stamp directory is located in a world-writable
directory (e.g.\&,
.Pa /tmp ) ,
it is possible for a user to create the time stamp directory before
.Nm sudo
is run.
However, because
.Nm sudo
checks the ownership and mode of the directory and its
contents, the only damage that can be done is to
.Dq hide
files by putting them in the time stamp dir.
This is unlikely to happen since once the time stamp dir is owned by root
and inaccessible by any other user, the user placing files there would be
unable to get them back out.
.Pp
.Nm sudo
will not honor time stamps set far in the future.
Time stamps with a date greater than current_time + 2 *
.Li TIMEOUT
will be ignored and sudo will log and complain.
This is done to keep a user from creating his/her own time stamp with a
bogus date on systems that allow users to give away files if the time
stamp directory is located in a world-writable directory.
.Pp
Since time stamp files live in the file system, they can outlive a
user's login session.
As a result, a user may be able to login, run a command with
.Nm sudo
after authenticating, logout, login again, and run
.Nm sudo
without authenticating so long as the time stamp file's modification
time is within
.Li @timeout@
minutes (or whatever the timeout is set to in
.Em sudoers ) .
When the
.Em tty_tickets
.Em sudoers
option is enabled, the time stamp has per-tty granularity but still
may outlive the user's session.
.Pp
Please note that
.Nm sudo
will normally only log the command it explicitly runs.
If a user runs a command such as
.Li sudo su
or
.Li sudo sh ,
subsequent commands run from that shell are not subject to
.Nm sudo Ns 's
security policy.
The same is true for commands that offer shell escapes (including
most editors).
If I/O logging is enabled, subsequent commands will have their input and/or
output logged, but there will not be traditional logs for those commands.
Because of this, care must be taken when giving users access to commands via
.Nm sudo
to verify that the command does not inadvertently give the user an
effective root shell.
For more information, please see the
.Em PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES
section in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ .
.Pp
To prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive information,
.Nm sudo
disables core dumps by default while it is executing (they are
re-enabled for the command that is run).
.Pp

.Em sudoers
entries, please see the
.Em SECURITY NOTES

.Sh CAVEATS
There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root shell
if that user is allowed to run arbitrary commands via
.Nm sudo .
Also, many programs (such as editors) allow the user to run commands
via shell escapes, thus avoiding
.Nm sudo Ns 's
checks.
However, on most systems it is possible to prevent shell escapes with
.Nm sudo Ns 's
.Em noexec
functionality.
See the
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@
manual for details.
.Pp
It is not meaningful to run the
.Li cd
command directly via sudo, e.g.,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sudo cd /usr/local/protected
.Ed
.Pp
since when the command exits the parent process (your shell) will
still be the same.
Please see the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for more information.
.Pp
Running shell scripts via
.Nm sudo
can expose the same kernel bugs that make setuid shell scripts
unsafe on some operating systems (if your OS has a /dev/fd/ directory,
setuid shell scripts are generally safe).
