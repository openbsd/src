.Sh NAME
.Nm sudoers.ldap
.Nd sudo LDAP configuration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In addition to the standard
.Em sudoers
file,
.Nm sudo
may be configured
via LDAP.
This can be especially useful for synchronizing
.Em sudoers
in a large, distributed environment.
.Pp
Using LDAP for
.Em sudoers
has several benefits:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Nm sudo
no longer needs to read
.Em sudoers
in its entirety.
When LDAP is used, there are only two or three LDAP queries per invocation.
This makes it especially fast and particularly usable in LDAP environments.
.It
.Nm sudo
no longer exits if there is a typo in
.Em sudoers .
It is not possible to load LDAP data into the server that does
not conform to the sudoers schema, so proper syntax is guaranteed.
It is still possible to have typos in a user or host name, but
this will not prevent
.Nm sudo
from running.
.It
It is possible to specify per-entry options that override the global
default options.
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers
only supports default options and limited options associated with
user/host/commands/aliases.
The syntax is complicated and can be difficult for users to understand.
Placing the options directly in the entry is more natural.
.It
The
.Nm visudo
program is no longer needed.
.Nm visudo
provides locking and syntax checking of the
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers
file.
Since LDAP updates are atomic, locking is no longer necessary.
Because syntax is checked when the data is inserted into LDAP, there
is no need for a specialized tool to check syntax.
.El
.Pp
Another major difference between LDAP and file-based
.Em sudoers
is that in LDAP,
.Nm sudo Ns No -specific
Aliases are not supported.
.Pp
For the most part, there is really no need for
.Nm sudo Ns No -specific
Aliases.
Unix groups or user netgroups can be used in place of User_Aliases and
Runas_Aliases.
Host netgroups can be used in place of Host_Aliases.
Since Unix groups and netgroups can also be stored in LDAP there is no
real need for
.Nm sudo Ns No -specific
aliases.
.Pp
Cmnd_Aliases are not really required either since it is possible
to have multiple users listed in a
.Li sudoRole .
Instead of defining a Cmnd_Alias that is referenced by multiple users,
one can create a
.Li sudoRole
that contains the commands and assign multiple users to it.
.Ss SUDOers LDAP container
The
.Em sudoers
configuration is contained in the
.Li ou=SUDOers
LDAP container.
.Pp
Sudo first looks for the
.Li cn=default
entry in the SUDOers container.
If found, the multi-valued
.Li sudoOption
attribute is parsed in the same manner as a global
.Li Defaults
line in
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers .
In the following example, the
.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK
variable will be preserved in the environment for all users.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
dn: cn=defaults,ou=SUDOers,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: sudoRole
cn: defaults
description: Default sudoOption's go here
sudoOption: env_keep+=SSH_AUTH_SOCK
.Ed
.Pp
The equivalent of a sudoer in LDAP is a
.Li sudoRole .
It consists of the following attributes:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy sudoUser
A user name, user ID (prefixed with
.Ql # ) ,
Unix group (prefixed with
.Ql % ) ,
Unix group ID (prefixed with
.Ql %# ) ,
or user netgroup (prefixed with
.Ql + ) .
.It Sy sudoHost
A host name, IP address, IP network, or host netgroup (prefixed with a
.Ql + ) .
The special value
.Li ALL
will match any host.
.It Sy sudoCommand
A Unix command with optional command line arguments, potentially
including globbing characters (aka wild cards).
The special value
.Li ALL
will match any command.
If a command is prefixed with an exclamation point
.Ql \&! ,
the user will be prohibited from running that command.
.It Sy sudoOption
Identical in function to the global options described above, but
specific to the
.Li sudoRole
in which it resides.
.It Sy sudoRunAsUser
A user name or uid (prefixed with
.Ql # )
that commands may be run as or a Unix group (prefixed with a
.Ql % )
or user netgroup (prefixed with a
.Ql + )
that contains a list of users that commands may be run as.
The special value
.Li ALL
will match any user.
.Pp
The
.Li sudoRunAsUser
attribute is only available in
.Nm sudo
versions
1.7.0 and higher.
Older versions of
.Nm sudo
use the
.Li sudoRunAs
attribute instead.
.It Sy sudoRunAsGroup
A Unix group or gid (prefixed with
.Ql # )
that commands may be run as.
The special value
.Li ALL
will match any group.
.Pp
The
.Li sudoRunAsGroup
attribute is only available in
.Nm sudo
versions
1.7.0 and higher.
.It Sy URI Ar ldap[s]://[hostname[:port]] ...
Specifies a whitespace-delimited list of one or more URIs describing
the LDAP server(s) to connect to.
The
.Em protocol
may be either
.Em ldap
.Em ldaps ,
the latter being for servers that support TLS (SSL) encryption.
If no
.Em port
is specified, the default is port 389 for
.Li ldap://
or port 636 for
.Li ldaps:// .
If no
.Em hostname
is specified,
.Nm sudo
will connect to
.Em localhost .
Multiple
.Sy URI
lines are treated identically to a
.Sy URI
line containing multiple entries.
Only systems using the OpenSSL libraries support the mixing of
.Li ldap://
and
.Li ldaps://
URIs.
Both the Netscape-derived and Tivoli LDAP libraries used on most commercial
versions of Unix are only capable of supporting one or the other.
.It Sy HOST Ar name[:port] ...
If no
.Sy URI
is specified, the
.Sy HOST
parameter specifies a whitespace-delimited list of LDAP servers to connect to.
Each host may include an optional
.Em port
separated by a colon
.Pq Ql :\& .
The
.Sy HOST
parameter is deprecated in favor of the
.Sy URI
specification and is included for backwards compatibility.
.It Sy PORT Ar port_number
If no
.Sy URI
is specified, the
.Sy PORT
parameter specifies the default port to connect to on the LDAP server if a
.Sy HOST
parameter does not specify the port itself.
If no
.Sy PORT
parameter is used, the default is port 389 for LDAP and port 636 for LDAP
over TLS (SSL).
The
.Sy PORT
parameter is deprecated in favor of the
.Sy URI
specification and is included for backwards compatibility.
.It Sy BIND_TIMELIMIT Ar seconds
The
.Sy BIND_TIMELIMIT
parameter specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait while trying
to connect to an LDAP server.
If multiple
.Sy URI Ns No s
or
.Sy HOST Ns No s
are specified, this is the amount of time to wait before trying
the next one in the list.
.It Sy TIMELIMIT Ar seconds
The
.Sy TIMELIMIT
parameter specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a
response to an LDAP query.
.It Sy SUDOERS_BASE Ar base
The base DN to use when performing
.Nm sudo
LDAP queries.
Typically this is of the form
.Li ou=SUDOers,dc=example,dc=com
for the domain
.Li example.com .
Multiple
.Sy SUDOERS_BASE
lines may be specified, in which case they are queried in the order specified.
.It Sy SUDOERS_DEBUG Ar debug_level
This sets the debug level for
.Nm sudo
LDAP queries.
Debugging information is printed to the standard error.
A value of 1 results in a moderate amount of debugging information.
A value of 2 shows the results of the matches themselves.
This parameter should not be set in a production environment as the
extra information is likely to confuse users.
.It Sy BINDDN Ar DN
The
.Sy BINDDN
parameter specifies the identity, in the form of a Distinguished Name (DN),
to use when performing LDAP operations.
If not specified, LDAP operations are performed with an anonymous identity.
By default, most LDAP servers will allow anonymous access.
.It Sy BINDPW Ar secret
The
.Sy BINDPW
parameter specifies the password to use when performing LDAP operations.
This is typically used in conjunction with the
.Sy BINDDN
parameter.
.It Sy ROOTBINDDN Ar DN
The
.Sy ROOTBINDDN
parameter specifies the identity, in the form of a Distinguished Name (DN),
to use when performing privileged LDAP operations, such as
.Em sudoers
queries.
The password corresponding
to the identity should be stored in
.Pa @ldap_secret@ .
If not specified, the
.Sy BINDDN
identity is used (if any).
.It Sy LDAP_VERSION Ar number
The version of the LDAP protocol to use when connecting to the server.
The default value is protocol version 3.
.It Sy SSL Ar on/true/yes/off/false/no
If the
.Sy SSL
parameter is set to
.Li on ,
.Li true
.Li or
.Li yes ,
TLS (SSL) encryption is always used when communicating with the LDAP server.
Typically, this involves connecting to the server on port 636 (ldaps).
.It Sy SSL Ar start_tls
If the
.Sy SSL
parameter is set to
.Li start_tls ,
the LDAP server connection is initiated normally and TLS encryption is
begun before the bind credentials are sent.
This has the advantage of not requiring a dedicated port for encrypted
communications.
This parameter is only supported by LDAP servers that honor the
.Em start_tls
extension, such as the OpenLDAP and Tivoli Directory servers.
.It Sy TLS_CHECKPEER Ar on/true/yes/off/false/no
If enabled,
.Sy TLS_CHECKPEER
will cause the LDAP server's TLS certificated to be verified.
If the server's TLS certificate cannot be verified (usually because it
is signed by an unknown certificate authority),
.Nm sudo
will be unable to connect to it.
If
.Sy TLS_CHECKPEER
is disabled, no check is made.
Note that disabling the check creates an opportunity for man-in-the-middle
attacks since the server's identity will not be authenticated.
If possible, the CA's certificate should be installed locally so it can
be verified.
This option is not supported by the Tivoli Directory Server LDAP libraries.
.It Sy TLS_CACERTFILE Ar file name
The path to a certificate authority bundle which contains the certificates
for all the Certificate Authorities the client knows to be valid, e.g.\&
.Pa /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem .
This option is only supported by the OpenLDAP libraries.
Netscape-derived LDAP libraries use the same certificate
database for CA and client certificates (see
.Sy TLS_CERT ) .
.It Sy TLS_CACERTDIR Ar directory
Similar to
.Sy TLS_CACERTFILE
but instead of a file, it is a directory containing individual
Certificate Authority certificates, e.g.\&
.Pa /etc/ssl/certs .
The directory specified by
.Sy TLS_CACERTDIR
is checked after
.Sy TLS_CACERTFILE .
This option is only supported by the OpenLDAP libraries.
.It Sy TLS_CERT Ar file name
The path to a file containing the client certificate which can
be used to authenticate the client to the LDAP server.
The certificate type depends on the LDAP libraries used.
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It OpenLDAP:
.Li tls_cert /etc/ssl/client_cert.pem
.It Netscape-derived:
.Li tls_cert /var/ldap/cert7.db
.It Tivoli Directory Server:
Unused, the key database specified by
.Sy TLS_KEY
contains both keys and certificates.
.Pp
When using Netscape-derived libraries, this file may also contain
Certificate Authority certificates.
.El
.It Sy TLS_KEY Ar file name
The path to a file containing the private key which matches the
certificate specified by
.Sy TLS_CERT .
The private key must not be password-protected.
The key type depends on the LDAP libraries used.
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It OpenLDAP:
.Li tls_key /etc/ssl/client_key.pem
.It Netscape-derived:
.Li tls_key /var/ldap/key3.db
.It Tivoli Directory Server:
.Li tls_cert /usr/ldap/ldapkey.kdb
.El
When using Tivoli LDAP libraries, this file may also contain
Certificate Authority and client certificates and may be encrypted.
.It Sy TLS_KEYPW Ar secret
The
.Sy TLS_KEYPW
contains the password used to decrypt the key database on clients
using the Tivoli Directory Server LDAP library.
If no
.Sy TLS_KEYPW
is specified, a
.Em stash file
will be used if it exists.
The
.Em stash file
must have the same path as the file specified by
.Sy TLS_KEY ,
but use a
.Li .sth
file extension instead of
.Li .kdb ,
e.g.\&
.Li ldapkey.sth .
The default
.Li ldapkey.kdb
that ships with Tivoli Directory Server is encrypted with the password
.Li ssl_password .
This option is only supported by the Tivoli LDAP libraries.
.It Sy TLS_RANDFILE Ar file name
The
.Sy TLS_RANDFILE
parameter specifies the path to an entropy source for systems that lack
a random device.
It is generally used in conjunction with
.Em prngd
or
.Em egd .
This option is only supported by the OpenLDAP libraries.
.It Sy TLS_CIPHERS Ar cipher list
The
.Sy TLS_CIPHERS
parameter allows the administer to restrict which encryption algorithms
may be used for TLS (SSL) connections.
See the OpenLDAP or Tivoli Directory Server manual for a list of valid
ciphers.
This option is not supported by Netscape-derived libraries.
.It Sy USE_SASL Ar on/true/yes/off/false/no
Enable
.Sy USE_SASL
for LDAP servers that support SASL authentication.
.It Sy SASL_AUTH_ID Ar identity
The SASL user name to use when connecting to the LDAP server.
By default,
.Nm sudo
will use an anonymous connection.
.It Sy ROOTUSE_SASL Ar on/true/yes/off/false/no
Enable
.Sy ROOTUSE_SASL
to enable SASL authentication when connecting
to an LDAP server from a privileged process, such as
.Nm sudo .
.It Sy ROOTSASL_AUTH_ID Ar identity
The SASL user name to use when
.Sy ROOTUSE_SASL
is enabled.
.It Sy SASL_SECPROPS Ar none/properties
SASL security properties or
.Em none
for no properties.
See the SASL programmer's manual for details.
.It Sy KRB5_CCNAME Ar file name
The path to the Kerberos 5 credential cache to use when authenticating
with the remote server.
.El
.Pp
See the
.Pa ldap.conf
entry in the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section.
.Ss Configuring nsswitch.conf
Unless it is disabled at build time,
.Nm sudo
consults the Name Service Switch file,
.Pa @nsswitch_conf@ ,
to specify the
.Em sudoers
search order.
Sudo looks for a line beginning with
.Li sudoers :
and uses this to determine the search order.
Note that
.Nm sudo
does
not stop searching after the first match and later matches take
precedence over earlier ones.
The following sources are recognized:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 8n -offset 4n -compact
.It files
read sudoers from
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers
.It ldap
read sudoers from LDAP
.El
.Pp
In addition, the entry
.Li [NOTFOUND=return]
will short-circuit the search if the user was not found in the
preceding source.
.Pp
To consult LDAP first followed by the local sudoers file (if it
exists), use:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
sudoers: ldap files
.Ed
.Pp
The local
.Em sudoers
file can be ignored completely by using:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
sudoers: ldap
.Ed
.Pp
If the
.Pa @nsswitch_conf@
file is not present or there is no sudoers line, the following
default is assumed:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
sudoers: files
.Ed
.Pp
Note that
.Pa @nsswitch_conf@
is supported even when the underlying operating system does not use
an nsswitch.conf file, except on AIX (see below).
.Ss Configuring netsvc.conf
On AIX systems, the
.Pa @netsvc_conf@
file is consulted instead of
.Pa @nsswitch_conf@ .
.Nm sudo
simply treats
.Pa netsvc.conf
as a variant of
.Pa nsswitch.conf ;
information in the previous section unrelated to the file format
itself still applies.
.Pp
To consult LDAP first followed by the local sudoers file (if it
exists), use:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
sudoers = ldap, files
.Ed
.Pp
The local
.Em sudoers
file can be ignored completely by using:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
sudoers = ldap
.Ed
.Pp
To treat LDAP as authoratative and only use the local sudoers file
if the user is not present in LDAP, use:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
sudoers = ldap = auth, files
.Ed
.Pp
Note that in the above example, the
.Li auth
qualfier only affects user lookups; both LDAP and
.Em sudoers
will be queried for
.Li Defaults
entries.
.Pp
If the
.Pa @netsvc_conf@
file is not present or there is no sudoers line, the following
default is assumed:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
sudoers = files
.Ed

#   * Ensure the keyfile is only readable by root.
#
# For OpenLDAP:
#tls_cert /etc/certs/client_cert.pem
#tls_key  /etc/certs/client_key.pem
#
# For SunONE or iPlanet LDAP, tls_cert and tls_key may specify either
# a directory, in which case the files in the directory must have the
# default names (e.g. cert8.db and key4.db), or the path to the cert
# and key files themselves.  However, a bug in version 5.0 of the LDAP
# SDK will prevent specific file names from working.  For this reason
# it is suggested that tls_cert and tls_key be set to a directory,
# not a file name.
#
# The certificate database specified by tls_cert may contain CA certs
# and/or the client's cert.  If the client's cert is included, tls_key
# should be specified as well.
# For backward compatibility, "sslpath" may be used in place of tls_cert.
