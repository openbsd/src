.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm libtool
.Nd compile and link complex libraries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for the eponymous GNU project.
The following differences in behaviour with GNU Libtool are intentional:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Relative
.Ar -L
paths are put before absolute ones.
This allows to fix many (but not all, unfortunately) issues when software
links to libraries already installed instead of those just built, because,
e.g.,
.Ar -L/usr/local/lib
comes before
.Ar -L../libfoo .
.It
Extra (duplicate)
.Ar -L
and
.Ar -l
items are stripped from link command line.
.It
When both
.Ar -lstdc++
and
.Ar -lestdc++
are encountered in link command line, only the latter is kept.
.El
