.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm last
.Op Fl Ns Ar c
.Op Fl Ns Ar n
.Op Fl Ns Ar s
.Op Fl Ns Ar T
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op Fl d Ar [[yy]yy[mm[dd[hh]]]]mm[.ss]
.Op Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm last
will either (1) list the sessions of specified
.Ar users ,
.Ar ttys ,
and
.Ar hosts , 
in reverse time order, 
or (2) list the users logged in at a specified snapshot date & time
in reverse time order.  Each line of output contains
the user name, the tty from which the session was conducted, any
hostname, the start and stop times for the session, and the duration
of the session.  If the session is still continuing or was cut short by
a crash or shutdown,
.Nm last
will so indicate.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent-two
.It Fl c
Calculates the total time displayed and prints it after the output.
.It Fl f Ar file
.Nm last
reads the file
.Ar file
instead of the default,
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
.It Fl Ar n
Limits the report to
.Ar n
lines.
.It Fl Ar s
Display time values in seconds since the epoch, instead of formated dates.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Specify the
.Ar tty .
tty names may be given fully or abbreviated, for example,
.Dq Li "last -t 03"
is
equivalent to
.Dq Li "last -t tty03" .
.It Fl h Ar host
.Ar host
names may be names or internet numbers.
.It Fl T
Display better time information, including seconds.
.It Fl d Ar date
Specify the snapshot date & time.  
All users logged in at the snapshot date & time will
be reported.
This may be used with the 
.Fl f
option to derive the results from stored wtmp files.
When this argument is provided, all other options except for
.Fl f
and 
.Fl n
are ignored.
The argument should be in the form
.Dq [[CC]YY][MMDD]hhmm[.SS]
where each pair of letters represents the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar CC
The first two digits of the year (the century).
.It Ar YY
The second two digits of the year.
If
.Dq YY
is specified, but
.Dq CC
is not, a value for
.Dq YY
between 69 and 99 results in a
.Dq YY
value of 19.
Otherwise, a
.Dq YY
value of 20 is used.
.It Ar MM
Month of the year, from 1 to 12.
.It Ar DD
Day of the month, from 1 to 31.
.It Ar hh
Hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
.It Ar mm
Minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
.It Ar SS
Second of the minute, from 0 to 61.
.El
.Pp
If the
.Dq CC
and
.Dq YY
letter pairs are not specified, the values default to the current
year.
If the
.Dq SS
letter pair is not specified, the value defaults to 0.
.El
.Pp
If
multiple arguments are given, and a snapshot time is not specified, the
information which applies to any of the
arguments is printed, e.g.,
.Dq Li "last root -t console"
would list all of
.Dq Li root Ns 's
sessions as well as all sessions on the console terminal. If no
users, hostnames or terminals are specified,
.Nm last
prints a record of
all logins and logouts.
.Pp
The pseudo-user
.Ar reboot
logs in at reboots of the system, thus
.Dq Li last reboot
will give an indication of mean time between reboot.
.Pp
If
.Nm last
is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has
progressed.  If interrupted with a quit signal
.Nm last
indicates how
far the search has progressed and then continues.
