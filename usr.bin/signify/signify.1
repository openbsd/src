.Nm signify
.Nd cryptographically sign and verify files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm signify

.Fl s Ar seckey
.Fl G
.Nm signify
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl o Ar output
.Fl s Ar seckey
.Fl S

.Nm signify
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl o Ar output
.Fl p Ar pubkey
.Fl V
.Ar message
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates and verifies cryptographic signatures for
an input file
.Ar message .
The mode of operation is selected by the
.Fl G ,
.Fl S ,
or
.Fl V
options.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Dssoutput
.It Fl e
Embed the message after the signature when signing.
For verification, extract the message from the signature.
.It Fl G
Generate a new keypair.
.It Fl n
Do not ask for a passphrase during key generation.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will prompt the user for a passphrase on the terminal.
.It Fl o Ar sigfile
The signature file to create or verify.
The default is
.Ar input Ns .sig .
.It Fl p Ar pubkey
Public key produced by
.Fl G ,
and used by
.Fl V
to check a signature.
.It Fl S
Sign the input file.
.It Fl s Ar seckey
Secret (private) key produced by
.Fl G ,
and used by
.Fl S
to sign a message.
.It Fl V
Verify the input file and signature match.
.El
.Pp
The key and signature files created by
.Nm
have the same format.
The first line of the file is a free form text comment that may be edited,
so long as it does not exceed a single line.
The second line of the file is the actual key or signature base64 encoded.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std signify
It may fail because of one of the following reasons:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Some necessary files do not exist.
.It
Entered passphrase is incorrect.
.It
The message file was corrupted and its signature does not match.
.It
The message file is too large.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a new keypair:
.Dl $ signify -G -p newkey.pub -s newkey.sec
.Pp
Sign a file, specifying a signature name:
.Dl $ signify -S -s key.sec -o msg.sig message.txt
.Pp
Verify a signature, using the default signature name:
.Dl $ signify -V -p key.pub generalsorders.txt
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cmp 1 ,
.Xr sha256 1 ,
.Xr ssh 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Ox 5.5 .
