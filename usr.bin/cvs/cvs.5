.Nd OpenCVS files format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the various support files for
.Xr cvs 1
and the format of those files.
.Pp
The location of a module's files are known as its
.Dv CVSROOT .
The files within CVSROOT are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT
Directory containing repository administrative files.
.It Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/config
File containing various configuration options.
The format of each line is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl keyword=value
.Pp
Extraneous spaces or tabs are not permitted.
A line beginning with a hash character
.Pq Sq #
is considered a comment and ignored.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "dlimit=XvalueXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It dlimit='value'
Set the process data size limit.
.It tag='value'
Set the name of a local tag to use in addition to Id.
.It umask='value'
Set the default umask to use when creating files and directories.
.El
.It Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history
File containing reports of
.Ic checkout ,
.Ic commit ,
.Ic export ,
.Ic release ,
.Ic rtag ,
and
.Ic update
commands that have been issued.
By default, the
.Ic init
command creates the
.Pa history
file.
To disable history logging, the
.Pa history
file should be removed manually.
The
.Ic history
command shows these reports according to several criteria.
.It Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/loginfo
File containing associations between modules and handlers for
post-commit logging.
.It Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/modules
The format of each line is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl module [option] directory [file ...] [&module ...]
.Pp
Empty lines are ignored.
A line beginning with a hash character
.Pq Sq #
is considered a comment and ignored.
A long line can be continued on the next line by specifying a backslash
.Pq Sq \e
character as last character.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl d Ar name
Allow check out of module under different
.Ar name .
.It Fl i Ar prog
Specify program
.Ar prog
to run whenever the
.Ic commit
command is issued.
.It Fl o Ar prog
Specify program
.Ar prog
to run whenever the
.Ic checkout
command is issued.
.It Fl s Ar status
Set
.Ar status
to module.
.It Fl t Ar prog
Specify program
.Ar prog
to run whenever the
.Ic rtag
command is issued.
.It Fl u Ar prog
Specify program
.Ar prog
to run whenever the
.Ic update
command is issued.
.El
.El
.Pp
Each directory that is managed by
.Nm
contains a
.Pa CVS
directory.
This directory is used by various
.Nm
commands to record the status of files in the current working directory.
These files should not be modified manually by the user but by the
.Nm
commands instead.
Files that are always stored in every
.Pa CVS
directory are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa CVS/Entries
File containing a list of files managed by
.Nm .
.Pa Entries
has one line per file or directory describing the state of it with
regard to the source repository.
These lines have the following format:
.Pp
.Dl /name/revision/timestamp/options/tag
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It name
Name of the file in the directory.
.It revision
Revision of the file in the working directory.
The revision is equal to
.Sq 0
if the file has been added with the
.Ic add
command or preceded by the
.Sq -
character if the file has been removed with the
.Ic remove
command.
.It timestamp
Contains the timestamp of the file at the time
.Nm
created it.
If the timestamp is different from the actual modification time of the file,
it means that the file has been modified.
.It options
Contains the keyword substitution mode used for this file.
.It tag
Contains
.Sq T
followed by a tagname or
.Sq D
followed by a date.
.El
.Pp
Entries corresponding to directories have the following format:
.Pp
.Dl D/name////
.Pp
The lines in the
.Pa Entries
file can be in any order.
.It Pa CVS/Repository
File containing the path to the corresponding directory in the
source repository.
.It Pa CVS/Root
File containing the value of the
.Ev CVSROOT
variable at the time of checkout.
This file is used by all
.Nm
commands instead of
.Ev CVSROOT
once
.Nm
has checked for its existence.
.El
.Pp
Depending on the circumstances, other files may exist in the
.Pa CVS
directory:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa CVS/Base
If pseudo-lock mode is enabled in client-server mode,
the
.Pa Base
directory contains a copy of the file on which the
.Ic edit
command has been issued.
This allows the
.Ic unedit
command to operate even if the CVS server is unreachable.
.It Pa CVS/Baserev
File listing the revisions for each file contained in the
.Pa Base
directory under the following format:
.Pp
.Dl name/revision/
.It Pa CVS/Baserev.tmp
Temporary file used to write
.Pa CVS/Baserev
content then atomically renamed to
.Pa Baserev .
.It Pa CVS/Checkin.prog
File containing the path to the command specified with the
.Fl i
option in the
.Pa CVSROOT/modules
file.
.It Pa CVS/Entries.Backup
Temporary file used to write
.Pa CVS/Entries
content then atomically renamed to
.Pa Entries .
.It Pa CVS/Entries.Static
Tells
.Nm
to not add files to the directory unless the
.Ic update
command is issued with the
.Fl d
option.
.It Pa CVS/Notify
File containing the notifications that could not be sent to the
CVS server but will be sent at the next successful connection.
.It Pa CVS/Notify.tmp
Temporary file used to write
.Pa CVS/Notify
content then atomically renamed to
.Pa Notify .
.It Pa CVS/Tag
File containing the symbolic revision that was used at checkout.
The first character of the line is a single letter indicating the
type of tag:
.Sq D ,
.Sq N ,
or
.Sq T ,
for date, non-branch tag, or branch tag, respectively.
The rest of the line is the tag or date itself.
The
.Pa Tag
file should not be removed manually:
instead, use
.Dq update -A .
.It Pa CVS/Template
File containing the template specified by the
.Pa CVSROOT/rcsinfo
file.
It is only used in client-server mode.
Locally,
.Nm
uses the
.Pa rcsinfo
file directly.
.It Pa CVS/Update.prog
File containing the path to the command specified with the
.Fl u
option in the
.Pa CVSROOT/modules
file.
.It Pa CVS/<name>,t
File containing the description of the file
.Pa file
that has been added with the
.Ic add
command.
This description is used by
.Nm
when archiving this file with the
.Ic commit
command.
.It Pa $HOME/.cvsignore
This file provides a list of files (or
.Xr sh 1
file name patterns) that should be ignored by
.Xr cvs 1
during the
.Ic import ,
.Ic release ,
and
.Ic update
commands.
.Pp
The syntax of the
.Nm
file consists of a series of lines, each of which contains a
space-separated list of filenames.
There is currently no way of using comments in this file.
.Pp
Default patterns that are ignored by
.Xr cvs 1
are as follows:
.Bd -filled
CVS,
RCS,
RCSLOG,
SCCS,
TAGS,
tags,
core,
cvslog*,
*.o,
*.so,
*.a,
*.bak,
*.orig,
*.rej,
*.old,
*.exe,
*.depend,
*.obj,
*.elc,
*.ln,
*.olb,
*.core,
\&.#*,
*~,
_$*,
*$,
#*,
,*.
.Ed
.Pp
The list can be modified using the methods described below:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
The
.Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore
file appends patterns to ignore for the whole repository.
.It
The
.Pa $HOME/.cvsignore
file appends patterns to ignore for user only.
.It
The content of the
.Ev CVSIGNORE
variable is appended to the list.
.It
Options to the command line
.Fl I
flag, available for the
.Ic import
and
.Ic update
commands, appends patterns for the current command line action only.
.It
.Pa .cvsignore
files placed in the repository directories allow to add patterns to
ignore locally.
They do not take effect on sub-directories.
.El
.Pp
The
.Sq !\&
character can be used to reset the list of patterns using any of these
five methods.
.Pp
For the
.Ic update
command,
.Xr cvs 1
handles files that are already present in the repository even if they
are in the list to ignore.
Files that are in the list to ignore but not in the repository will not
be listed.
This way, files preceded by the
.Sq ?\&
character will not appear even if they should.
.It Pa $HOME/.cvsrc
This file provides a way to give the
.Xr cvs 1
program implicit global options and command-specific options.
Unless the
.Fl f
option is specified,
.Xr cvs 1
reads its startup configuration file
.Pa .cvsrc
from the home directory of the user who invoked it.
.Pp
The format of each line is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl command [arg ...]
.Pp
where
.Ar command
is either the
.Sq cvs
keyword to specify global options, one of the supported
.Xr cvs 1
commands or a command alias.
Arguments following
.Ar command
will be added implicitly to the appropriate command's argument vector if it is
run.
Lines whose
.Ar command
argument is not a valid command will generate a warning when running with
the
.Fl V
flag.
.Pp
Empty lines are ignored.
A line beginning with a hash character
.Pq Sq #
is considered a comment and ignored.
.Pp
For example, to specify that
.Xr cvs 1
should always run in quiet mode and the
.Ic diff
internal command should always produce unified output:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cvs -q
diff -u
.Ed
.It Pa $HOME/.cvswrappers
This file, located in
.Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT
and/or
.Pa $HOME/.cvswrappers ,
provides a way to configure filters for
.Xr cvs 1
based on file type (name).
This works by specifying a pattern to match for varying file types.
.Pp
The format of each line is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl pattern [option 'value'] [option 'value'] ...
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar filter
Execute
.Ar filter
when the file is extracted from the repository (for the
.Ic checkout ,
.Ic export ,
and
.Ic update
commands).
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode.
See the
.Sx KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION
section of
.Xr rcs 1
for more information.
.It Fl m Ar method
Specify the merge methodology to be used when a file is updated.
.Pp
The methods are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It COPY
When the
.Ic update
command is used,
.Xr cvs 1
will merely copy one version over another and let the user do the merge
by himself.
This method is used by default on binary files (see the
.Fl k Ar b
option).
.It MERGE
Try to merge the files.
This method is the default.
.El
.It Fl t Ar filter
Execute
.Ar filter
before the file is archived in the repository (for the
.Ic commit ,
and
.Ic import
commands).
.El
.It Pa $TMPDIR/cvs-serv Ns Aq Pa pid
Temporary directory created by the server where
.Ar pid
is the process ID of the server.
It is located in the directory specified by the
.Ev TMPDIR
environment variable or the
.Fl T
global option.
See above for more information.
