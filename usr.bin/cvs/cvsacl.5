It is composed of access rules, each on a single line, which either allow
or deny certain operations on files or entire directories.

.Nm
grammar is expressed in BNF (Backus-Naur Form) notation.
Terminals are displayed as normal text.
Nonterminals are in bold.

and
.Ql \&]
.Pc
is optional.
The pipe character
.Pq Ql \&|
is used to separate multiple choices.
