.Sh NAME
.Nm cvs
.Nd OpenCVS Concurrent Versioning System client/server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl flQqv
.Op Fl d Ar root
.Op Fl e Ar editor
.Ar command Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program acts as both client and server for the use of and administration of
a CVS source repository.
CVS is used to maintain version information on files that are kept in a
repository.
Although it is more commonly used to track changes in source code, there
are no real limitations to the type of files that you can store in a
repository.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar root
Use
.Ar root
as the path to the root directory of the CVS repository.
The value must specify an absolute path.
.It Fl e Ar editor
Use the program
.Ar editor
whenever editing log information.
This option overrides the environment variables CVSEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR.
.It Fl f
Do not read the contents of the user's .cvsrc file on startup.
.It Fl l
Suppress logging of history information.
.It Fl Q
Be extra quiet.
Only error messages will be displayed.
.It Fl q
Be quiet about reporting.
.It Fl v
Display version information and exit.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.Ic add
.Ar file Op ...
Before a file is known to CVS, it must be added to the repository using
this command.
Adding a file does not actually publish the contents of the
file, so you must commit the first revision in order to let other users
see the file with the
.Ic update
command.
.Pp
.Ic commit
.Op Fl m Ar msg
The
.Ic commit
command is used to send local changes back to the server and update the
repository's information to reflect the changes.
.Pp
.Ic update
.Op Fl dP
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa $HOME/.cvsrc
File containing a list of implicit options to pass to certain commands.
This file is read on startup unless the
.Fl f
option is specified.
.It Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT
Directory containing repository administrative files.
.It Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/loginfo
File containing associations between modules and handlers for
post-commit logging.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width CVS_CLIENT_LOG
.It Ev CVSROOT
When set, this variable should contain the string pointing to the root
directory of the CVS repository.
The contents of this variable are ignored when the
.Fl d
option is given or if `Root' files exist in the checked-out copy.
.It Ev CVS_RSH
Name of the program to use when connecting to the server through a remote
shell.
The default is to use the
.Xr ssh 1
program.
.It Ev CVS_SERVER
If set, gives the name of the program to invoke as a
.Nm
server when using remote shell.
The default is to use `cvs'.
.It Ev CVSEDITOR
Name of the editor to use when editing commit messages.
Checked before EDITOR and VISUAL.
.It Ev EDITOR
.It Ev VISUAL
.It Ev CVS_CLIENT_LOG
This variable enables logging of all communications between the client and
server when running in non-local mode.
If set, this environment variable must contain a base path from which two
paths will be generated by appending ".in" to the value for the server's
input and ".out" for the server's output.

.Sh CAVEATS
This CVS implementation does not fully conform to the GNU CVS version.
In many cases, this was done explicitly because GNU CVS has inconsistencies
or ambiguous behaviour.
.Sh HISTORY
The OpenCVS project is a BSD-licensed rewrite of the original
Concurrent Versioning System written by Jean-Francois Brousseau.
The original CVS code was written in large parts by Dick Grune,
Brian Berliner and Jeff Polk.
