.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm OpenSSL
is a cryptography toolkit implementing the
Transport Layer Security
.Pq TLS v1
network protocol,
as well as related cryptography standards.
.Pp
The
.Nm
program is a command line tool for using the various
cryptography functions of
.Nm openssl Ns 's
crypto library from the shell.
.Pp
The pseudo-commands
.Cm list-standard-commands , list-message-digest-commands ,
and
.Cm list-cipher-commands
output a list
.Pq one entry per line
of the names of all standard commands, message digest commands,
or cipher commands, respectively, that are available in the present
.Nm
utility.
.Pp
The pseudo-commands
.Cm list-cipher-algorithms
and
.Cm list-message-digest-algorithms
list all cipher and message digest names,
one entry per line.
Aliases are listed as:
.Pp
.D1 from => to
.Pp
The pseudo-command
.Cm list-public-key-algorithms
lists all supported public key algorithms.
.Pp
The pseudo-command
.Cm no- Ns Ar command
tests whether a command of the
specified name is available.
If
.Ar command
does not exist,
it returns 0
and prints
.Cm no- Ns Ar command ;
otherwise it returns 1 and prints
.Ar command .
In both cases, the output goes to stdout and nothing is printed to stderr.
Additional command line arguments are always ignored.
Since for each cipher there is a command of the same name,
this provides an easy way for shell scripts to test for the
availability of ciphers in the
.Nm
program.
.Pp
.Sy Note :
.Cm no- Ns Ar command
is not able to detect pseudo-commands such as
.Cm quit ,
.Cm list- Ns Ar ... Ns Cm -commands ,
or
.Cm no- Ns Ar command
itself.

.Pp
The
.Nm asn1parse
command is a diagnostic utility that can parse ASN.1 structures.
It can also be used to extract data from ASN.1 formatted data.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl dlimit Ar number
Dump the first
.Ar number
bytes of unknown data in hex form.
.It Fl dump
Dump unknown data in hex form.
.It Fl genconf Ar file , Fl genstr Ar str
Generate encoded data based on string
.Ar str ,
file
.Ar file ,
or both, using the format described in
.Xr ASN1_generate_nconf 3 .
If only
.Ar file
is present then the string is obtained from the default section
using the name
.Dq asn1 .
The encoded data is passed through the ASN.1 parser and printed out as
though it came from a file;
the contents can thus be examined and written to a file using the
.Fl out
option.
.It Fl i
Indent the output according to the
.Qq depth
of the structures.
.It Fl in Ar file
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified.
.It Fl inform Cm der | pem | txt
The input format.
.It Fl length Ar number
Number of bytes to parse; the default is until end of file.
.It Fl noout
Do not output the parsed version of the input file.
.It Fl offset Ar number
Starting offset to begin parsing; the default is start of file.
.It Fl oid Ar file
A file containing additional object identifiers
.Pq OIDs .
If an OID
.Pq object identifier
is not part of
.Nm openssl Ns 's
internal table it will be represented in
numerical form
.Pq for example 1.2.3.4 .
.Pp
Each line consists of three columns:
the first column is the OID in numerical format and should be followed by
whitespace.
The second column is the
.Qq short name ,
which is a single word followed by whitespace.
The final column is the rest of the line and is the
.Qq long name .
.Nm asn1parse
displays the long name.
.It Fl out Ar file
The DER-encoded output file; the default is no encoded output
(useful when combined with
.Fl strparse ) .
.It Fl strparse Ar offset
Parse the content octets of the ASN.1 object starting at
.Ar offset .
This option can be used multiple times to
.Qq drill down
into a nested structure.

.Pp
The
.Nm ca
command is a minimal certificate authority (CA) application.
It can be used to sign certificate requests in a variety of forms
and generate certificate revocation lists (CRLs).
It also maintains a text database of issued certificates and their status.
.Pp
The options relevant to CAs are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It Fl batch
Batch mode.
In this mode no questions will be asked
and all certificates will be certified automatically.
.It Fl cert Ar file
The CA certificate file.
.It Fl config Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl create_serial
If reading the serial from the text file as specified in the
configuration fails, create a new random serial to be used as the
next serial number.
.It Fl days Ar arg
The number of days to certify the certificate for.
.It Fl enddate Ar date
Set the expiry date.
The format of the date is [YY]YYMMDDHHMMSSZ,
with all four year digits required for dates from 2050 onwards.
.It Fl extensions Ar section
The section of the configuration file containing certificate extensions
to be added when a certificate is issued (defaults to
.Cm x509_extensions
unless the
.Fl extfile
option is used).
If no extension section is present, a V1 certificate is created.
If the extension section is present
.Pq even if it is empty ,
then a V3 certificate is created.
See the
.Xr x509v3.cnf 5
manual page for details of the extension section format.
.It Fl extfile Ar file
An additional configuration
.Ar file
to read certificate extensions from
(using the default section unless the
.Fl extensions
option is also used).
.It Fl in Ar file
An input
.Ar file
containing a single certificate request to be signed by the CA.
.It Fl infiles
If present, this should be the last option; all subsequent arguments
are assumed to be the names of files containing certificate requests.
.It Fl key Ar password
The
.Fa password
used to encrypt the private key.
Since on some systems the command line arguments are visible,
this option should be used with caution.
.It Fl keyfile Ar file
The private key to sign requests with.
.It Fl keyform Cm pem | der
Private key file format.
The default is
.Cm pem .
.It Fl md Ar alg
The message digest to use.
Possible values include
.Ar md5
and
.Ar sha1 .
This option also applies to CRLs.
.It Fl msie_hack
This is a legacy option to make
.Nm ca
work with very old versions of the IE certificate enrollment control
.Qq certenr3 .
It used UniversalStrings for almost everything.
Since the old control has various security bugs,
its use is strongly discouraged.
The newer control
.Qq Xenroll
does not need this option.
.It Fl multivalue\-rdn
This option causes the
.Fl subj
argument to be interpreted with full support for multivalued RDNs,
for example
.Qq "/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe" .
If
.Fl multivalue\-rdn
is not used, the UID value is set to
.Qq "123456+CN=John Doe" .
.It Fl name Ar section
Specifies the configuration file
.Ar section
to use (overrides
.Cm default_ca
in the
.Cm ca
section).
.It Fl noemailDN
The DN of a certificate can contain the EMAIL field if present in the
request DN, however it is good policy just having the email set into
the
.Cm altName
extension of the certificate.
When this option is set, the EMAIL field is removed from the certificate's
subject and set only in the, eventually present, extensions.
The
.Ar email_in_dn
keyword can be used in the configuration file to enable this behaviour.
.It Fl notext
Don't output the text form of a certificate to the output file.
.It Fl out Ar file
The output file to output certificates to.
The default is standard output.
The certificate details will also be printed out to this file in
PEM format, except that
.Fl spkac
outputs DER format.
.It Fl outdir Ar directory
The
.Ar directory
to output certificates to.
The certificate will be written to a file consisting of the
serial number in hex with
.Qq .pem
appended.
.It Fl passin Ar arg
The key password source.
.It Fl policy Ar arg
Define the CA
.Qq policy
to use.
The policy section in the configuration file
consists of a set of variables corresponding to certificate DN fields.
The values may be one of
.Qq match
(the value must match the same field in the CA certificate),
.Qq supplied
(the value must be present), or
.Qq optional
(the value may be present).
Any fields not mentioned in the policy section
are silently deleted, unless the
.Fl preserveDN
option is set,
but this can be regarded more of a quirk than intended behaviour.
.It Fl preserveDN
Normally, the DN order of a certificate is the same as the order of the
fields in the relevant policy section.
When this option is set, the order is the same as the request.
This is largely for compatibility with the older IE enrollment control
which would only accept certificates if their DNs matched the order of the
request.
This is not needed for Xenroll.
.It Fl selfsign
Indicates the issued certificates are to be signed with the key the
certificate requests were signed with, given with
.Fl keyfile .
Certificate requests signed with a different key are ignored.
If
.Fl gencrl ,
.Fl spkac ,
or
.Fl ss_cert
are given,
.Fl selfsign
is ignored.
.Pp
A consequence of using
.Fl selfsign
is that the self-signed certificate appears among the entries in
the certificate database (see the configuration option
.Cm database )
and uses the same serial number counter as all other certificates
signed with the self-signed certificate.
.It Fl spkac Ar file
A file containing a single Netscape signed public key and challenge,
and additional field values to be signed by the CA.
This will usually come from the
KEYGEN tag in an HTML form to create a new private key.
It is, however, possible to create SPKACs using the
.Nm spkac
utility.
.Pp
The file should contain the variable SPKAC set to the value of
the SPKAC and also the required DN components as name value pairs.
If it's necessary to include the same component twice,
then it can be preceded by a number and a
.Sq \&. .
.It Fl ss_cert Ar file
A single self-signed certificate to be signed by the CA.
.It Fl startdate Ar date
Set the start date.
The format of the date is [YY]YYMMDDHHMMSSZ,
with all four year digits required for dates from 2050 onwards.
.It Fl subj Ar arg
Supersedes the subject name given in the request.
The
.Ar arg
must be formatted as
.Sm off
.Pf / Ar type0 Ns = Ar value0 Ns / Ar type 1 Ns = Ar value 1 Ns /
.Ar type2 Ns = Ar ... ;
.Sm on
characters may be escaped by
.Sq \e
.Pq backslash ,
no spaces are skipped.
.It Fl utf8
Interpret field values read from a terminal or obtained from a
configuration file as UTF-8 strings.
By default, they are interpreted as ASCII.
.It Fl verbose
Print extra details about the operations being performed.
.El
.Pp
The options relevant to CRLs are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It Fl crl_CA_compromise Ar time
This is the same as
.Fl crl_compromise ,
except the revocation reason is set to CACompromise.
.It Fl crl_compromise Ar time
Set the revocation reason to keyCompromise and the compromise time to
.Ar time .
.Ar time
should be in GeneralizedTime format, i.e. YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ.
.It Fl crl_hold Ar instruction
Set the CRL revocation reason code to certificateHold and the hold
instruction to
.Ar instruction
which must be an OID.
Although any OID can be used, only holdInstructionNone
(the use of which is discouraged by RFC 2459), holdInstructionCallIssuer or
holdInstructionReject will normally be used.
.It Fl crl_reason Ar reason
Revocation reason, where
.Ar reason
is one of:
unspecified, keyCompromise, CACompromise, affiliationChanged, superseded,
cessationOfOperation, certificateHold or removeFromCRL.
The matching of
.Ar reason
is case insensitive.
Setting any revocation reason will make the CRL v2.
In practice, removeFromCRL is not particularly useful because it is only used
in delta CRLs which are not currently implemented.
.It Fl crldays Ar num
The number of days before the next CRL is due.
This is the days from now to place in the CRL
.Cm nextUpdate
field.
.It Fl crlexts Ar section
The
.Ar section
of the configuration file containing CRL extensions to include.
If no CRL extension section is present then a V1 CRL is created;
if the CRL extension section is present
(even if it is empty)
then a V2 CRL is created.
The CRL extensions specified are CRL extensions and not CRL entry extensions.
It should be noted that some software can't handle V2 CRLs.
See the
.Xr x509v3.cnf 5
manual page for details of the extension section format.
.It Fl crlhours Ar num
The number of hours before the next CRL is due.
.It Fl gencrl
Generate a CRL based on information in the index file.
.It Fl revoke Ar file
A
.Ar file
containing a certificate to revoke.
.It Fl status Ar serial
Show the status of the certificate with serial number
.Ar serial .
.It Fl updatedb
Update the database index to purge expired certificates.
.El
.Pp
Many of the options can be set in the
.Cm ca
section of the configuration file
(or in the default section of the configuration file),
specified using
.Cm default_ca
or
.Fl name .
The options
.Cm preserve
and
.Cm msie_hack
are read directly from the
.Cm ca
section.
.Pp
Many of the configuration file options are identical to command line
options.
Where the option is present in the configuration file and the command line,
the command line value is used.
Where an option is described as mandatory, then it must be present in
the configuration file or the command line equivalent
.Pq if any
used.
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It Cm certificate
The same as
.Fl cert .
It gives the file containing the CA certificate.
Mandatory.
.It Cm copy_extensions
Determines how extensions in certificate requests should be handled.
If set to
.Cm none
or this option is not present, then extensions are
ignored and not copied to the certificate.
If set to
.Cm copy ,
then any extensions present in the request that are not already present
are copied to the certificate.
If set to
.Cm copyall ,
then all extensions in the request are copied to the certificate:
if the extension is already present in the certificate it is deleted first.
.Pp
The
.Cm copy_extensions
option should be used with caution.
If care is not taken, it can be a security risk.
For example, if a certificate request contains a
.Cm basicConstraints
extension with CA:TRUE and the
.Cm copy_extensions
value is set to
.Cm copyall
and the user does not spot
this when the certificate is displayed, then this will hand the requester
a valid CA certificate.
.Pp
This situation can be avoided by setting
.Cm copy_extensions
to
.Cm copy
and including
.Cm basicConstraints
with CA:FALSE in the configuration file.
Then if the request contains a
.Cm basicConstraints
extension, it will be ignored.
.Pp
The main use of this option is to allow a certificate request to supply
values for certain extensions such as
.Cm subjectAltName .
.It Cm crl_extensions
The same as
.Fl crlexts .
.It Cm crlnumber
A text file containing the next CRL number to use in hex.
The CRL number will be inserted in the CRLs only if this file exists.
If this file is present, it must contain a valid CRL number.
.It Cm database
The text database file to use.
Mandatory.
This file must be present, though initially it will be empty.
.It Cm default_crl_hours , default_crl_days
The same as the
.Fl crlhours
and
.Fl crldays
options.
These will only be used if neither command line option is present.
At least one of these must be present to generate a CRL.
.It Cm default_days
The same as the
.Fl days
option.
The number of days to certify a certificate for.
.It Cm default_enddate
The same as the
.Fl enddate
option.
Either this option or
.Cm default_days
.Pq or the command line equivalents
must be present.
.It Cm default_md
The same as the
.Fl md
option.
The message digest to use.
Mandatory.
.It Cm default_startdate
The same as the
.Fl startdate
option.
The start date to certify a certificate for.
If not set, the current time is used.
.It Cm email_in_dn
The same as
.Fl noemailDN .
If the EMAIL field is to be removed from the DN of the certificate,
simply set this to
.Qq no .
If not present, the default is to allow for the EMAIL field in the
certificate's DN.
.It Cm msie_hack
The same as
.Fl msie_hack .
.It Cm name_opt , cert_opt
These options allow the format used to display the certificate details
when asking the user to confirm signing.
All the options supported by the
.Nm x509
utilities'
.Fl nameopt
and
.Fl certopt
switches can be used here, except that
.Cm no_signame
and
.Cm no_sigdump
are permanently set and cannot be disabled
(this is because the certificate signature cannot be displayed because
the certificate has not been signed at this point).
.Pp
For convenience, the value
.Cm ca_default
is accepted by both to produce a reasonable output.
.Pp
If neither option is present, the format used in earlier versions of
.Nm openssl
is used.
Use of the old format is strongly discouraged
because it only displays fields mentioned in the
.Cm policy
section,
mishandles multicharacter string types and does not display extensions.
.It Cm new_certs_dir
The same as the
.Fl outdir
command line option.
It specifies the directory where new certificates will be placed.
Mandatory.
.It Cm oid_file
This specifies a file containing additional object identifiers.
Each line of the file should consist of the numerical form of the
object identifier followed by whitespace, then the short name followed
by whitespace and finally the long name.
.It Cm oid_section
This specifies a section in the configuration file containing extra
object identifiers.
Each line should consist of the short name of the object identifier
followed by
.Sq =
and the numerical form.
The short and long names are the same when this option is used.
.It Cm policy
The same as
.Fl policy .
Mandatory.
.It Cm preserve
The same as
.Fl preserveDN .
.It Cm private_key
Same as the
.Fl keyfile
option.
The file containing the CA private key.
Mandatory.
.It Cm serial
A text file containing the next serial number to use in hex.
Mandatory.
This file must be present and contain a valid serial number.
.It Cm unique_subject
If the value
.Cm yes
is given, the valid certificate entries in the
database must have unique subjects.
If the value
.Cm no
is given,
several valid certificate entries may have the exact same subject.
The default value is
.Cm yes .
.It Cm x509_extensions
The same as
.Fl extensions .
.El
.Sh CIPHERS
.Nm openssl ciphers
.Op Fl hVv
.Op Ar control
.Pp
The
.Nm ciphers
command converts the
.Ar control
string from the format documented in
.Xr SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list 3
into an ordered SSL cipher suite preference list.
If no
.Ar control
string is specified, the
.Cm DEFAULT
list is printed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h , \&?
Print a brief usage message.
.It Fl V
Verbose.
List ciphers with cipher suite code in hex format,
cipher name, and a complete description of protocol version,

.Pp
Some of the ciphers do not have large keys and others have security
implications if not used correctly.
All the block ciphers normally use PKCS#5 padding,
also known as standard block padding.

command takes a file containing a Netscape certificate sequence
(an alternative to the standard PKCS#7 format)
and prints out the certificates contained in it,
or takes a file of certificates
and converts it into a Netscape certificate sequence.
.Pp
The options are as follows:

.It Fl in Ar file
The input file to read from,
or standard input if not specified.
.It Fl out Ar file
The output file to write to,
or standard output if not specified.
.It Fl toseq
Normally, a Netscape certificate sequence will be input and the output
is the certificates contained in it.
With the
.Fl toseq
option the situation is reversed:
a Netscape certificate sequence is created from a file of certificates.

.Pp
The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
enables applications to determine the (revocation) state
of an identified certificate (RFC 2560).
.Pp
The
.Nm ocsp
command performs many common OCSP tasks.
It can be used to print out requests and responses,
create requests and send queries to an OCSP responder,
and behave like a mini OCSP server itself.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl CAfile Ar file , Fl CApath Ar directory
A file or path containing trusted CA certificates,
used to verify the signature on the OCSP response.
.It Fl cert Ar file
Add the certificate
.Ar file
to the request.
The issuer certificate is taken from the previous
.Fl issuer
option, or an error occurs if no issuer certificate is specified.
.It Fl dgst Ar alg
Use the digest algorithm
.Ar alg
for certificate identification in the OCSP request.
By default SHA-1 is used.
.It Xo
.Fl host Ar hostname : Ns Ar port ,
.Fl path Ar path
.Xc
Send
the OCSP request to
.Ar hostname
on
.Ar port .
.Fl path
specifies the HTTP path name to use, or
.Pa /
by default.
.It Fl issuer Ar file
The current issuer certificate, in PEM format.
Can be used multiple times and must come before any
.Fl cert
options.
.It Fl no_cert_checks
Don't perform any additional checks on the OCSP response signer's certificate.
That is, do not make any checks to see if the signer's certificate is
authorised to provide the necessary status information:
as a result this option should only be used for testing purposes.
.It Fl no_cert_verify
Don't verify the OCSP response signer's certificate at all.
Since this option allows the OCSP response to be signed by any certificate,
it should only be used for testing purposes.
.It Fl no_certs
Don't include any certificates in the signed request.
.It Fl no_chain
Do not use certificates in the response as additional untrusted CA
certificates.
.It Fl no_intern
Ignore certificates contained in the OCSP response
when searching for the signer's certificate.
The signer's certificate must be specified with either the
.Fl verify_other
or
.Fl VAfile
options.
.It Fl no_signature_verify
Don't check the signature on the OCSP response.
Since this option tolerates invalid signatures on OCSP responses,
it will normally only be used for testing purposes.
.It Fl nonce , no_nonce
Add an OCSP nonce extension to a request,
or disable an OCSP nonce addition.
Normally, if an OCSP request is input using the
.Fl respin
option no nonce is added:
using the
.Fl nonce
option will force the addition of a nonce.
If an OCSP request is being created (using the
.Fl cert
and
.Fl serial
options)
a nonce is automatically added; specifying
.Fl no_nonce
overrides this.
.It Fl noverify
Don't attempt to verify the OCSP response signature or the nonce values.
This is normally only be used for debugging
since it disables all verification of the responder's certificate.
.It Fl out Ar file
Specify the output file to write to,
or standard output if not specified.
.It Fl req_text , resp_text , text
Print out the text form of the OCSP request, response, or both, respectively.
.It Fl reqin Ar file , Fl respin Ar file
Read an OCSP request or response file from
.Ar file .
These options are ignored
if an OCSP request or response creation is implied by other options
(for example with the
.Fl serial , cert ,
and
.Fl host
options).
.It Fl reqout Ar file , Fl respout Ar file
Write out the DER-encoded certificate request or response to
.Ar file .
.It Fl serial Ar num
Same as the
.Fl cert
option except the certificate with serial number
.Ar num
is added to the request.
The serial number is interpreted as a decimal integer unless preceded by
.Sq 0x .
Negative integers can also be specified
by preceding the value with a minus sign.
.It Fl sign_other Ar file
Additional certificates to include in the signed request.
.It Fl signer Ar file , Fl signkey Ar file
Sign the OCSP request using the certificate specified in the
.Fl signer
option and the private key specified by the
.Fl signkey
option.
If the
.Fl signkey
option is not present, then the private key is read from the same file
as the certificate.
If neither option is specified, the OCSP request is not signed.
.It Fl trust_other
The certificates specified by the
.Fl verify_other
option should be explicitly trusted and no additional checks will be
performed on them.
This is useful when the complete responder certificate chain is not available
or trusting a root CA is not appropriate.
.It Fl url Ar responder_url
Specify the responder URL.
Both HTTP and HTTPS
.Pq SSL/TLS
URLs can be specified.
.It Fl VAfile Ar file
A file containing explicitly trusted responder certificates.
Equivalent to the
.Fl verify_other
and
.Fl trust_other
options.
.It Fl validity_period Ar nsec , Fl status_age Ar age
The range of times, in seconds, which will be tolerated in an OCSP response.
Each certificate status response includes a notBefore time
and an optional notAfter time.
The current time should fall between these two values,
but the interval between the two times may be only a few seconds.
In practice the OCSP responder and clients' clocks may not be precisely
synchronised and so such a check may fail.
To avoid this the
.Fl validity_period
option can be used to specify an acceptable error range in seconds,
the default value being 5 minutes.
.Pp
If the notAfter time is omitted from a response,
it means that new status information is immediately available.
In this case the age of the notBefore field is checked
to see it is not older than
.Ar age
seconds old.
By default, this additional check is not performed.
.It Fl verify_other Ar file
A file containing additional certificates to search
when attempting to locate the OCSP response signing certificate.
Some responders omit the actual signer's certificate from the response,
so this can be used to supply the necessary certificate.
.El
.Pp
The options for the OCSP server are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It Fl CA Ar file
CA certificate corresponding to the revocation information in
.Ar indexfile .
.It Fl index Ar indexfile
.Ar indexfile
is a text index file in ca format
containing certificate revocation information.
.Pp
If this option is specified,
.Nm ocsp
is in responder mode, otherwise it is in client mode.
The requests the responder processes can be either specified on
the command line (using the
.Fl issuer
and
.Fl serial
options), supplied in a file (using the
.Fl respin
option), or via external OCSP clients (if
.Ar port
or
.Ar url
is specified).
.Pp
If this option is present, then the
.Fl CA
and
.Fl rsigner
options must also be present.
.It Fl nmin Ar minutes , Fl ndays Ar days
Number of
.Ar minutes
or
.Ar days
when fresh revocation information is available:
used in the nextUpdate field.
If neither option is present,
the nextUpdate field is omitted,
meaning fresh revocation information is immediately available.
.It Fl nrequest Ar number
Exit after receiving
.Ar number
requests (the default is unlimited).
.It Fl port Ar portnum
Port to listen for OCSP requests on.
May also be specified using the
.Fl url
option.
.It Fl resp_key_id
Identify the signer certificate using the key ID;
the default is to use the subject name.
.It Fl resp_no_certs
Don't include any certificates in the OCSP response.
.It Fl rkey Ar file
The private key to sign OCSP responses with;
if not present, the file specified in the
.Fl rsigner
option is used.
.It Fl rother Ar file
Additional certificates to include in the OCSP response.
.It Fl rsigner Ar file
The certificate to sign OCSP responses with.
.El
.Pp
Initially the OCSP responder certificate is located and the signature on
the OCSP request checked using the responder certificate's public key.
Then a normal certificate verify is performed on the OCSP responder certificate
building up a certificate chain in the process.
The locations of the trusted certificates used to build the chain can be
specified by the
.Fl CAfile
and
.Fl CApath
options or they will be looked for in the standard
.Nm openssl
certificates directory.
.Pp
If the initial verify fails, the OCSP verify process halts with an error.
Otherwise the issuing CA certificate in the request is compared to the OCSP
responder certificate: if there is a match then the OCSP verify succeeds.
.Pp
Otherwise the OCSP responder certificate's CA is checked against the issuing
CA certificate in the request.
If there is a match and the OCSPSigning extended key usage is present
in the OCSP responder certificate, then the OCSP verify succeeds.
.Pp
Otherwise the root CA of the OCSP responder's CA is checked to see if it
is trusted for OCSP signing.
If it is, the OCSP verify succeeds.
.Pp
If none of these checks is successful, the OCSP verify fails.
What this effectively means is that if the OCSP responder certificate is
authorised directly by the CA it is issuing revocation information about
(and it is correctly configured),
then verification will succeed.
.Pp
If the OCSP responder is a global responder,
which can give details about multiple CAs
and has its own separate certificate chain,
then its root CA can be trusted for OCSP signing.
Alternatively, the responder certificate itself can be explicitly trusted
with the
.Fl VAfile
option.

.Pq sometimes referred to as PFX files
to be created and parsed.
By default, a PKCS#12 file is parsed;
a PKCS#12 file can be created by using the

.Pp
The options for parsing a PKCS12 file are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It Fl aes128 | aes192 | aes256 | des | des3
Encrypt private keys
using AES, DES, or triple DES, respectively.
The default is triple DES.
.It Fl cacerts
Only output CA certificates
.Pq not client certificates .
.It Fl clcerts
Only output client certificates
.Pq not CA certificates .
.It Fl in Ar file
The input file to read from,
or standard input if not specified.
.It Fl info
Output additional information about the PKCS#12 file structure,
algorithms used, and iteration counts.
.It Fl nocerts
Do not output certificates.
.It Fl nodes
Do not encrypt private keys.
.It Fl nokeys
Do not output private keys.
.It Fl nomacver
Do not attempt to verify the integrity MAC before reading the file.
.It Fl noout
Do not output the keys and certificates to the output file
version of the PKCS#12 file.
.It Fl out Ar file
The output file to write to,
or standard output if not specified.
.It Fl passin Ar arg
The key password source.
.It Fl passout Ar arg
The output file password source.
.It Fl twopass
Prompt for separate integrity and encryption passwords: most software
always assumes these are the same so this option will render such
PKCS#12 files unreadable.
.El
.Pp
The options for PKCS12 file creation are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It Fl CAfile Ar file
CA storage as a file.
.It Fl CApath Ar directory
CA storage as a directory.
The directory must be a standard certificate directory:
that is, a hash of each subject name (using
.Nm x509 Fl hash )
should be linked to each certificate.
.It Fl caname Ar name
Specify the
.Qq friendly name
for other certificates.
May be used multiple times to specify names for all certificates
in the order they appear.
.It Fl certfile Ar file
A file to read additional certificates from.
.It Fl certpbe Ar alg , Fl keypbe Ar alg
Specify the algorithm used to encrypt the private key and
certificates to be selected.
Any PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 PBE algorithm name can be used.
If a cipher name
(as output by the
.Cm list-cipher-algorithms
command) is specified then it
is used with PKCS#5 v2.0.
For interoperability reasons it is advisable to only use PKCS#12 algorithms.
.It Fl chain
Include the entire certificate chain of the user certificate.
The standard CA store is used for this search.
If the search fails, it is considered a fatal error.
.It Fl CSP Ar name
Write
.Ar name
as a Microsoft CSP name.
.It Fl descert
Encrypt the certificate using triple DES; this may render the PKCS#12
file unreadable by some
.Qq export grade
software.
By default, the private key is encrypted using triple DES and the
certificate using 40-bit RC2.
.It Fl export
Create a PKCS#12 file (rather than parsing one).
.It Fl in Ar file
The input file to read from,
or standard input if not specified.
The order doesn't matter but one private key and its corresponding
certificate should be present.
If additional certificates are present, they will also be included
in the PKCS#12 file.
.It Fl inkey Ar file
File to read a private key from.
If not present, a private key must be present in the input file.
.It Fl keyex | keysig
Specify whether the private key is to be used for key exchange or just signing.
Normally,
.Qq export grade
software will only allow 512-bit RSA keys to be
used for encryption purposes, but arbitrary length keys for signing.
The
.Fl keysig
option marks the key for signing only.
Signing only keys can be used for S/MIME signing, authenticode
(ActiveX control signing)
and SSL client authentication.
.It Fl macalg Ar alg
Specify the MAC digest algorithm.
The default is SHA1.
.It Fl maciter
Included for compatibility only:
it used to be needed to use MAC iterations counts
but they are now used by default.
.It Fl name Ar name
Specify the
.Qq friendly name
for the certificate and private key.
This name is typically displayed in list boxes by software importing the file.
.It Fl nomac
Don't attempt to provide the MAC integrity.
.It Fl nomaciter , noiter
Affect the iteration counts on the MAC and key algorithms.
.Pp
To discourage attacks by using large dictionaries of common passwords,
the algorithm that derives keys from passwords can have an iteration count
applied to it: this causes a certain part of the algorithm to be repeated
and slows it down.
The MAC is used to check the file integrity but since it will normally
have the same password as the keys and certificates it could also be attacked.
By default, both MAC and encryption iteration counts are set to 2048;
using these options the MAC and encryption iteration counts can be set to 1.
Since this reduces the file security you should not use these options
unless you really have to.
Most software supports both MAC and key iteration counts.
.It Fl out Ar file
The output file to write to,
or standard output if not specified.
.It Fl passin Ar arg
The key password source.

.It rsa_padding_mode : Ns Ar mode
This sets the RSA padding mode.
Acceptable values for
.Ar mode
are
.Cm pkcs1
for PKCS#1 padding;
.Cm none
for no padding;
.Cm oaep
for OAEP mode;
.Cm x931
for X9.31 mode;
and
.Cm pss
for PSS.
.Pp
In PKCS#1 padding if the message digest is not set then the supplied data is
signed or verified directly instead of using a DigestInfo structure.
If a digest is set then a DigestInfo
structure is used and its length
must correspond to the digest type.
For oeap mode only encryption and decryption is supported.
For x931 if the digest type is set it is used to format the block data;
otherwise the first byte is used to specify the X9.31 digest ID.
Sign, verify, and verifyrecover can be performed in this mode.
For pss mode only sign and verify are supported and the digest type must be
specified.
.It rsa_pss_saltlen : Ns Ar len
For pss
mode only this option specifies the salt length.
Two special values are supported:
-1 sets the salt length to the digest length.
When signing -2 sets the salt length to the maximum permissible value.
When verifying -2 causes the salt length to be automatically determined
based on the PSS block structure.
.El
.Pp
The DSA algorithm supports the sign and verify operations.
Currently there are no additional options other than
.Ar digest .
Only the SHA1 digest can be used and this digest is assumed by default.
.Pp
The DH algorithm supports the derive operation
and no additional options.
.Pp
The EC algorithm supports the sign, verify, and derive operations.
The sign and verify operations use ECDSA and derive uses ECDH.

If this option is not specified,
the filename present in the configuration file is used.
.It Fl md5 | sha1 | sha256
The message digest to sign the request with.
This overrides the digest algorithm specified in the configuration file.
.Pp
Some public key algorithms may override this choice.
For instance, DSA signatures always use SHA1.
.It Fl modulus
Print the value of the modulus of the public key contained in the request.
.It Fl nameopt Ar option , Fl reqopt Ar option
Determine how the subject or issuer names are displayed.
.Ar option
can be a single option or multiple options separated by commas.
Alternatively, these options may be used more than once to set multiple options.
See the
.Sx X509
section below for details.
.It Fl new
Generate a new certificate request.
The user is prompted for the relevant field values.
The actual fields prompted for and their maximum and minimum sizes
are specified in the configuration file and any requested extensions.
.Pp
If the
.Fl key
option is not used, it will generate a new RSA private
key using information specified in the configuration file.
.It Fl newhdr
Add the word NEW to the PEM file header and footer lines
on the outputed request.
Some software and CAs need this.
.It Fl newkey Ar arg
Create a new certificate request and a new private key.
The argument takes one of several forms.
.Pp
.No rsa : Ns Ar nbits

.Sq 0x .
It is possible to use negative serial numbers but this is not recommended.
.It Fl subj Ar arg
Replaces the subject field of an input request
with the specified data and output the modified request.
.Ar arg
must be formatted as /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...;
characters may be escaped by
.Sq \e
(backslash);
no spaces are skipped.
.It Fl subject
Print the request subject (or certificate subject if
.Fl x509
is specified).

Interpret field values as UTF8 strings, not ASCII.
.It Fl verbose
Print extra details about the operations being performed.
.It Fl verify
Verify the signature on the request.
.It Fl x509
Output a self-signed certificate instead of a certificate request.
This is typically used to generate a test certificate or a self-signed root CA.
The extensions added to the certificate (if any)
are specified in the configuration file.
Unless specified using the
.Fl set_serial
option, 0 is used for the serial number.
.El
.Pp
The configuration options are specified in the
.Qq req
section of the configuration file.
The options available are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It Cm attributes
The section containing any request attributes: its format
is the same as
.Cm distinguished_name .
Typically these may contain the challengePassword or unstructuredName types.
They are currently ignored by the
.Nm openssl
request signing utilities, but some CAs might want them.
.It Cm default_bits
The default key size, in bits.
The default is 2048.
It is used if the
.Fl new
option is used and can be overridden by using the
.Fl newkey
option.
.It Cm default_keyfile
The default file to write a private key to,
or standard output if not specified.
It can be overridden by the
.Fl keyout
option.
.It Cm default_md
The digest algorithm to use.
Possible values include
.Cm md5 ,
.Cm sha1
and
.Cm sha256
(the default).
It can be overridden on the command line.
.It Cm distinguished_name
The section containing the distinguished name fields to
prompt for when generating a certificate or certificate request.
The format is described below.
.It Cm encrypt_key
If set to
.Qq no
and a private key is generated, it is not encrypted.
It is equivalent to the
.Fl nodes
option.
For compatibility,
.Cm encrypt_rsa_key
is an equivalent option.
.It Cm input_password | output_password
The passwords for the input private key file (if present)
and the output private key file (if one will be created).
The command line options
.Fl passin
and
.Fl passout
override the configuration file values.
.It Cm oid_file
A file containing additional OBJECT IDENTIFIERS.
Each line of the file should consist of the numerical form of the
object identifier, followed by whitespace, then the short name followed
by whitespace and finally the long name.
.It Cm oid_section
Specify a section in the configuration file containing extra
object identifiers.
Each line should consist of the short name of the
object identifier followed by
.Sq =
and the numerical form.
The short and long names are the same when this option is used.
.It Cm prompt
If set to
.Qq no ,
it disables prompting of certificate fields
and just takes values from the config file directly.
It also changes the expected format of the
.Cm distinguished_name
and
.Cm attributes
sections.
.It Cm req_extensions
The configuration file section containing a list of
extensions to add to the certificate request.
It can be overridden by the
.Fl reqexts
option.
.It Cm string_mask
Limit the string types for encoding certain fields.
The following values may be used, limiting strings to the indicated types:
.Bl -tag -width "MASK:number"
.It Cm utf8only
UTF8String.
This is the default, as recommended by PKIX in RFC 2459.
.It Cm default
PrintableString, IA5String, T61String, BMPString, UTF8String.
.It Cm pkix
PrintableString, IA5String, BMPString, UTF8String.
Inspired by the PKIX recommendation in RFC 2459 for certificates
generated before 2004, but differs by also permitting IA5String.
.It Cm nombstr
PrintableString, IA5String, T61String, UniversalString.
A workaround for some ancient software that had problems
with the variable-sized BMPString and UTF8String types.
.It Cm MASK : Ns Ar number
An explicit bitmask of permitted types, where
.Ar number
is a C-style hex, decimal, or octal number that's a bit-wise OR of
.Dv B_ASN1_*
values from
.In openssl/asn1.h .
.El
.It Cm utf8
If set to
.Qq yes ,
field values are interpreted as UTF8 strings.
.It Cm x509_extensions
The configuration file section containing a list of
extensions to add to a certificate generated when the
.Fl x509
switch is used.
It can be overridden by the
.Fl extensions
command line switch.
.El
.Pp
There are two separate formats for the distinguished name and attribute
sections.
If the
.Fl prompt
option is set to
.Qq no ,
then these sections just consist of field names and values.
If the
.Fl prompt
option is absent or not set to
.Qq no ,
then the file contains field prompting information of the form:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
fieldName="prompt"
fieldName_default="default field value"
fieldName_min= 2
fieldName_max= 4
.Ed
.Pp
.Qq fieldName
is the field name being used, for example
.Cm commonName
(or CN).
The
.Qq prompt
string is used to ask the user to enter the relevant details.
If the user enters nothing, the default value is used;
if no default value is present, the field is omitted.
A field can still be omitted if a default value is present,
if the user just enters the
.Sq \&.
character.
.Pp
The number of characters entered must be between the
fieldName_min and fieldName_max limits:
there may be additional restrictions based on the field being used
(for example
.Cm countryName
can only ever be two characters long and must fit in a
.Cm PrintableString ) .
.Pp
Some fields (such as
.Cm organizationName )
can be used more than once in a DN.
This presents a problem because configuration files will
not recognize the same name occurring twice.
To avoid this problem, if the
.Cm fieldName
contains some characters followed by a full stop, they will be ignored.
So, for example, a second
.Cm organizationName
can be input by calling it
.Qq 1.organizationName .
.Pp
The actual permitted field names are any object identifier short or
long names.
These are compiled into
.Nm openssl
and include the usual values such as
.Cm commonName , countryName , localityName , organizationName ,
.Cm organizationalUnitName , stateOrProvinceName .
Additionally,
.Cm emailAddress
is included as well as
.Cm name , surname , givenName , initials
and
.Cm dnQualifier .
.Pp
Additional object identifiers can be defined with the
.Cm oid_file
or
.Cm oid_section
options in the configuration file.
Any additional fields will be treated as though they were a
.Cm DirectoryString .

If none of these options are specified, the key is written in plain text.
This means that using the
.Nm rsa
utility to read in an encrypted key with no encryption option can be used
to remove the pass phrase from a key, or by setting the encryption options
it can be used to add or change the pass phrase.
These options can only be used with PEM format output files.

If a connection is established with an SSL server, any data received
from the server is displayed and any key presses will be sent to the
server.
When used interactively (which means neither
.Fl quiet

or if end of file is reached, the connection will be closed down.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Attempt connections using IPv4 only.
.It Fl 6
Attempt connections using IPv6 only.
.It Fl bugs

A
.Ar file
containing trusted certificates to use during server authentication
and to use when attempting to build the client certificate chain.
.It Fl CApath Ar directory
The
.Ar directory
to use for server certificate verification.
This directory must be in
.Qq hash format ;
see
.Fl verify
for more information.
These are also used when building the client certificate chain.
.It Fl cert Ar file
The certificate to use, if one is requested by the server.
The default is not to use a certificate.

.Fl check_ss_sig ,
.Fl crl_check ,
.Fl crl_check_all ,
.Fl extended_crl ,
.Fl ignore_critical ,

Set various certificate chain validation options.
See the
.Nm verify
command for details.
.It Fl cipher Ar cipherlist
Modify the cipher list sent by the client.
Although the server determines which cipher suite is used, it should take
the first supported cipher in the list sent by the client.
See the
.Nm ciphers
command for more information.
.It Fl connect Ar host Ns Op : Ns Ar port
The
.Ar host
and
.Ar port
to connect to.
If not specified, an attempt is made to connect to the local host
on port 4433.
Alternatively, the host and port pair may be separated using a forward-slash
character,
which is useful for numeric IPv6 addresses.
.It Fl crlf
Translate a line feed from the terminal into CR+LF,
as required by some servers.
.It Fl debug
Print extensive debugging information, including a hex dump of all traffic.
.It Fl groups Ar ecgroups
Specify a colon-separated list of permitted EC curve groups.
.It Fl ign_eof
Inhibit shutting down the connection when end of file is reached in the input.
.It Fl key Ar keyfile

.It Fl msg
Show all protocol messages with hex dump.
.It Fl nbio
Turn on non-blocking I/O.
.It Fl nbio_test
Test non-blocking I/O.
.It Fl no_tls1 | no_tls1_1 | no_tls1_2
Disable the use of TLS1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, respectively.
.It Fl no_ticket
Disable RFC 4507 session ticket support.
.It Fl pause
Pause 1 second between each read and write call.
.It Fl prexit
Print session information when the program exits.
This will always attempt
to print out information even if the connection fails.
Normally, information will only be printed out once if the connection succeeds.
This option is useful because the cipher in use may be renegotiated
or the connection may fail because a client certificate is required or is
requested only after an attempt is made to access a certain URL.
Note that the output produced by this option is not always accurate
because a connection might never have been established.
.It Fl proxy Ar host : Ns Ar port
Use the HTTP proxy at
.Ar host
and
.Ar port .
The connection to the proxy is done in cleartext and the
.Fl connect
argument is given to the proxy.
If not specified, localhost is used as final destination.
After that, switch the connection through the proxy to the destination
to TLS.
.It Fl psk Ar key
Use the PSK key
.Ar key
when using a PSK cipher suite.
The key is given as a hexadecimal number without the leading 0x,
for example -psk 1a2b3c4d.
.It Fl psk_identity Ar identity
Use the PSK
.Ar identity
when using a PSK cipher suite.
.It Fl quiet
Inhibit printing of session and certificate information.
This implicitly turns on
.Fl ign_eof
as well.
.It Fl reconnect
Reconnect to the same server 5 times using the same session ID; this can
be used as a test that session caching is working.
.It Fl servername Ar name
Include the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) extension in the ClientHello
message, using the specified server
.Ar name .
.It Fl showcerts
Display the whole server certificate chain: normally only the server
certificate itself is displayed.
.It Fl starttls Ar protocol
Send the protocol-specific messages to switch to TLS for communication.
.Ar protocol
is a keyword for the intended protocol.
Currently, the supported keywords are
.Qq ftp ,
.Qq imap ,
.Qq smtp ,
.Qq pop3 ,
and
.Qq xmpp .
.It Fl state
Print the SSL session states.
.It Fl tls1 | tls1_1 | tls1_2
Permit only TLS1.0, 1.1, or 1.2, respectively.
.It Fl tlsextdebug
Print a hex dump of any TLS extensions received from the server.
.It Fl verify Ar depth
Turn on server certificate verification,
with a maximum length of
.Ar depth .
Currently the verify operation continues after errors so all the problems
with a certificate chain can be seen.
As a side effect the connection will never fail due to a server
certificate verify failure.
.It Fl xmpphost Ar hostname
When used with
.Fl starttls Ar xmpp ,
specify the host for the "to" attribute of the stream element.
If this option is not specified then the host specified with

The
.Nm s_server
command implements a generic SSL/TLS server which listens
for connections on a given port using SSL/TLS.
.Pp
If a connection request is established with a client and neither the
.Fl www
nor the
.Fl WWW
option has been used, then any data received
from the client is displayed and any key presses are sent to the client.
Certain single letter commands perform special operations:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX" -compact
.It Ic P
Send plain text, which should cause the client to disconnect.
.It Ic Q
End the current SSL connection and exit.
.It Ic q
End the current SSL connection, but still accept new connections.
.It Ic R
Renegotiate the SSL session and request a client certificate.
.It Ic r
Renegotiate the SSL session.
.It Ic S
Print out some session cache status information.
.El
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl accept Ar port
Listen on TCP
.Ar port
for connections.
The default is port 4433.
.It Fl bugs
Enable various workarounds for buggy implementations.
.It Fl CAfile Ar file
A
.Ar file
containing trusted certificates to use during client authentication
and to use when attempting to build the server certificate chain.
The list is also used in the list of acceptable client CAs passed to the
client when a certificate is requested.
.It Fl CApath Ar directory
The
.Ar directory
to use for client certificate verification.
This directory must be in
.Qq hash format ;
see
.Fl verify
for more information.
These are also used when building the server certificate chain.
.It Fl cert Ar file
The certificate to use: most server's cipher suites require the use of a
certificate and some require a certificate with a certain public key type.
For example, the DSS cipher suites require a certificate containing a DSS
(DSA) key.
If not specified, the file
.Pa server.pem
will be used.
.It Fl cipher Ar cipherlist
Modify the cipher list used by the server.
This allows the cipher list used by the server to be modified.
When the client sends a list of supported ciphers, the first client cipher
also included in the server list is used.
Because the client specifies the preference order, the order of the server
cipherlist is irrelevant.
See the
.Nm ciphers
command for more information.
.It Fl context Ar id
Set the SSL context ID.
It can be given any string value.
.It Fl crl_check , crl_check_all
Check the peer certificate has not been revoked by its CA.
The CRLs are appended to the certificate file.
.Fl crl_check_all
checks all CRLs of all CAs in the chain.
.It Fl crlf
Translate a line feed from the terminal into CR+LF.
.It Fl dcert Ar file , Fl dkey Ar file
Specify an additional certificate and private key; these behave in the
same manner as the
.Fl cert
and
.Fl key
options except there is no default if they are not specified
(no additional certificate or key is used).
By using RSA and DSS certificates and keys,
a server can support clients which only support RSA or DSS cipher suites
by using an appropriate certificate.
.It Fl debug
Print extensive debugging information, including a hex dump of all traffic.
.It Fl dhparam Ar file
The DH parameter file to use.
The ephemeral DH cipher suites generate keys
using a set of DH parameters.
If not specified, an attempt is made to
load the parameters from the server certificate file.
If this fails, a static set of parameters hard coded into the
.Nm s_server
program will be used.
.It Fl hack
Enables a further workaround for some early Netscape SSL code.
.It Fl HTTP
Emulate a simple web server.
Pages are resolved relative to the current directory.
For example if the URL
.Pa https://myhost/page.html
is requested, the file
.Pa ./page.html
will be loaded.
The files loaded are assumed to contain a complete and correct HTTP
response (lines that are part of the HTTP response line and headers
must end with CRLF).
.It Fl id_prefix Ar arg
Generate SSL/TLS session IDs prefixed by
.Ar arg .
This is mostly useful for testing any SSL/TLS code
that wish to deal with multiple servers,
when each of which might be generating a unique range of session IDs.
.It Fl key Ar keyfile
The private key to use.
If not specified, the certificate file will be used.
.It Fl msg
Show all protocol messages with hex dump.
.It Fl nbio
Turn on non-blocking I/O.
.It Fl nbio_test
Test non-blocking I/O.
.It Fl no_dhe
Disable ephemeral DH cipher suites.
.It Fl no_tls1 | no_tls1_1 | no_tls1_2
Disable the use of TLS1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, respectively.
.It Fl no_tmp_rsa
Disable temporary RSA key generation.
.It Fl nocert
Do not use a certificate.
This restricts the cipher suites available to the anonymous ones
(currently just anonymous DH).
.It Fl psk Ar key
Use the PSK key
.Ar key
when using a PSK cipher suite.
The key is given as a hexadecimal number without the leading 0x,
for example -psk 1a2b3c4d.
.It Fl psk_hint Ar hint
Use the PSK identity hint
.Ar hint
when using a PSK cipher suite.
.It Fl quiet
Inhibit printing of session and certificate information.
.It Fl serverpref
Use server's cipher preferences.
.It Fl state
Print the SSL session states.
.It Fl tls1 | tls1_1 | tls1_2
Permit only TLS1.0, 1.1, or 1.2, respectively.
.It Fl WWW
Emulate a simple web server.
Pages are resolved relative to the current directory.
For example if the URL
.Pa https://myhost/page.html
is requested, the file
.Pa ./page.html
will be loaded.
.It Fl www
Send a status message to the client when it connects,
including information about the ciphers used and various session parameters.
The output is in HTML format so this option will normally be used with a
web browser.
.It Fl Verify Ar depth , Fl verify Ar depth
Request a certificate chain from the client,
with a maximum length of
.Ar depth .
With
.Fl Verify ,
the client must supply a certificate or an error occurs;
with
.Fl verify ,
a certificate is requested but the client does not have to send one.

The certificate to use, if one is requested by the server.
The default is not to use a certificate.
.It Fl cipher Ar cipherlist
Modify the cipher list sent by the client.
Although the server determines which cipher suite is used,
it should take the first supported cipher in the list sent by the client.
See the

Currently the verify operation continues after errors, so all the problems
with a certificate chain can be seen.
As a side effect,
the connection will never fail due to a server certificate verify failure.
.It Fl www Ar page
The page to GET from the server.
A value of

.Pp
The
.Nm smime
command handles S/MIME mail.
It can encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify S/MIME messages.
.Pp
The MIME message must be sent without any blank lines between the
headers and the output.
Some mail programs will automatically add a blank line.
Piping the mail directly to an MTA is one way to
achieve the correct format.
.Pp
The supplied message to be signed or encrypted must include the necessary
MIME headers or many S/MIME clients won't display it properly (if at all).
Use the
.Fl text
option to automatically add plain text headers.
.Pp
A
.Qq signed and encrypted
message is one where a signed message is then encrypted.
This can be produced by encrypting an already signed message.
.Pp
There are a number of operations that can be performed, as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It Fl decrypt
Decrypt mail using the supplied certificate and private key.
The input file is an encrypted mail message in MIME format.
The decrypted mail is written to the output file.
.It Fl encrypt
Encrypt mail for the given recipient certificates.
The input is the message to be encrypted.
The output file is the encrypted mail, in MIME format.
.It Fl pk7out
Take an input message and write out a PEM-encoded PKCS#7 structure.
.It Fl resign
Resign a message: take an existing message and one or more new signers.
.It Fl sign
Sign mail using the supplied certificate and private key.
The input file is the message to be signed.
The signed message, in MIME format, is written to the output file.
.It Fl verify
Verify signed mail.
The input is a signed mail message and the output is the signed data.
Both clear text and opaque signing is supported.
.El
.Pp

.It Xo
.Fl aes128 | aes192 | aes256 | des |
.Fl des3 | rc2-40 | rc2-64 | rc2-128
.Xc
The encryption algorithm to use.
128-, 192-, or 256-bit AES, DES (56 bits), triple DES (168 bits),
or 40-, 64-, or 128-bit RC2, respectively;
if not specified, 40-bit RC2 is
used.
Only used with
.Fl encrypt .
.It Fl binary
Normally, the input message is converted to
.Qq canonical
format which uses CR/LF as end of line,
as required by the S/MIME specification.
When this option is present no translation occurs.
This is useful when handling binary data which may not be in MIME format.
.It Fl CAfile Ar file
A
.Ar file
containing trusted CA certificates; only used with
.Fl verify .
.It Fl CApath Ar directory
A
.Ar directory
containing trusted CA certificates; only used with
.Fl verify .
This directory must be a standard certificate directory:
that is, a hash of each subject name (using
.Nm x509 -hash )
should be linked to each certificate.
.It Ar cert.pem ...
One or more certificates of message recipients: used when encrypting
a message.
.It Fl certfile Ar file
Allows additional certificates to be specified.
When signing, these will be included with the message.
When verifying, these will be searched for the signers' certificates.
The certificates should be in PEM format.

.Xc
Set various certificate chain validation options.
See the
.Nm verify
command for details.
.It Fl content Ar file
A file containing the detached content.
This is only useful with the
.Fl verify
option,
and only usable if the PKCS#7 structure is using the detached
signature form where the content is not included.
This option will override any content if the input format is S/MIME
and it uses the multipart/signed MIME content type.
.It Xo
.Fl from Ar addr ,
.Fl subject Ar s ,
.Fl to Ar addr
.Xc
The relevant mail headers.
These are included outside the signed
portion of a message so they may be included manually.
When signing, many S/MIME
mail clients check that the signer's certificate email
address matches the From: address.
.It Fl in Ar file
The input file to read from.
.It Fl indef
Enable streaming I/O for encoding operations.
This permits single pass processing of data without
the need to hold the entire contents in memory,
potentially supporting very large files.
Streaming is automatically set for S/MIME signing with detached
data if the output format is SMIME;
it is currently off by default for all other operations.
.It Fl inform Cm der | pem | smime
The input format.
.It Fl inkey Ar file
The private key to use when signing or decrypting,
which must match the corresponding certificate.
If this option is not specified, the private key must be included
in the certificate file specified with
the
.Fl recip
or
.Fl signer
file.
When signing,
this option can be used multiple times to specify successive keys.
.It Fl keyform Cm pem
Input private key format.
.It Fl md Ar digest
The digest algorithm to use when signing or resigning.
If not present then the default digest algorithm for the signing key is used
(usually SHA1).
.It Fl noattr
Do not include attributes.
.It Fl nocerts
Do not include the signer's certificate.
This will reduce the size of the signed message but the verifier must
have a copy of the signer's certificate available locally (passed using the
.Fl certfile
option, for example).
.It Fl nochain
Do not do chain verification of signers' certificates: that is,
don't use the certificates in the signed message as untrusted CAs.
.It Fl nodetach
When signing a message use opaque signing: this form is more resistant
to translation by mail relays but it cannot be read by mail agents that
do not support S/MIME.
Without this option cleartext signing with the MIME type
multipart/signed is used.
.It Fl noindef
Disable streaming I/O where it would produce an encoding of indefinite length
(currently has no effect).
.It Fl nointern
Only use certificates specified in the
.Fl certfile .
The supplied certificates can still be used as untrusted CAs.
.It Fl nosigs
Do not try to verify the signatures on the message.
.It Fl noverify
Do not verify the signer's certificate of a signed message.
.It Fl out Ar file
The output file to write to.
.It Fl outform Cm der | pem | smime
The output format.
The default is smime, which writes an S/MIME format message.
.Cm pem
and
.Cm der
change this to write PEM and DER format PKCS#7 structures instead.
This currently only affects the output format of the PKCS#7
structure; if no PKCS#7 structure is being output (for example with
.Fl verify
or
.Fl decrypt )
this option has no effect.
.It Fl passin Ar arg
The key password source.
.It Fl recip Ar file
The recipients certificate when decrypting a message.
This certificate
must match one of the recipients of the message or an error occurs.
.It Fl signer Ar file
A signing certificate when signing or resigning a message;
this option can be used multiple times if more than one signer is required.
If a message is being verified, the signer's certificates will be
written to this file if the verification was successful.
.It Fl stream
The same as
.Fl indef .
.It Fl text
Add plain text (text/plain) MIME
headers to the supplied message if encrypting or signing.
If decrypting or verifying, it strips off text headers:
if the decrypted or verified message is not of MIME type text/plain
then an error occurs.
.El

.Pp
The
.Nm ts
command is a basic Time Stamping Authority (TSA) client and server
application as specified in RFC 3161 (Time-Stamp Protocol, TSP).
A TSA can be part of a PKI deployment and its role is to provide long
term proof of the existence of specific data.
Here is a brief description of the protocol:
.Bl -enum
.It
The TSA client computes a one-way hash value for a data file and sends
the hash to the TSA.
.It
The TSA attaches the current date and time to the received hash value,
signs them and sends the time stamp token back to the client.
By creating this token the TSA certifies the existence of the original
data file at the time of response generation.
.It
The TSA client receives the time stamp token and verifies the
signature on it.
It also checks if the token contains the same hash
value that it had sent to the TSA.
.El
.Pp
There is one DER-encoded protocol data unit defined for transporting a time
stamp request to the TSA and one for sending the time stamp response
back to the client.
The
.Nm ts
command has three main functions:
creating a time stamp request based on a data file;
creating a time stamp response based on a request;
and verifying if a response corresponds
to a particular request or a data file.
.Pp
There is no support for sending the requests/responses automatically
over HTTP or TCP yet as suggested in RFC 3161.
Users must send the requests either by FTP or email.
.Pp
The
.Fl query
switch can be used for creating and printing a time stamp
request with the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl cert
Expect the TSA to include its signing certificate in the response.
.It Fl config Ar configfile
Specify an alternative configuration file.
Only the OID section is used.
.It Fl data Ar file_to_hash
The data file for which the time stamp request needs to be created.
The default is standard input.
.It Fl digest Ar digest_bytes
Specify the message imprint explicitly without the data file.
The imprint must be specified in a hexadecimal format,
two characters per byte,
the bytes optionally separated by colons.
The number of bytes must match the message digest algorithm in use.
.It Fl in Ar request.tsq
A previously created time stamp request in DER
format that will be printed into the output file.
Useful for examining the content of a request in human-readable format.
.It Fl md4 | md5 | ripemd160 | sha | sha1
The message digest to apply to the data file.
It supports all the message digest algorithms that are supported by the
.Nm dgst
command.
The default is SHA-1.
.It Fl no_nonce
Specify no nonce in the request.
The default, to include a 64-bit long pseudo-random nonce,
is recommended to protect against replay attacks.
.It Fl out Ar request.tsq
The output file to write to,
or standard output if not specified.
.It Fl policy Ar object_id
The policy that the client expects the TSA to use for creating the
time stamp token.
Either dotted OID notation or OID names defined
in the config file can be used.
If no policy is requested the TSA uses its own default policy.
.It Fl text
Output in human-readable text format instead of DER.
.El
.Pp
A time stamp response (TimeStampResp) consists of a response status
and the time stamp token itself (ContentInfo),
if the token generation was successful.
The
.Fl reply
command is for creating a time stamp
response or time stamp token based on a request and printing the
response/token in human-readable format.
If
.Fl token_out
is not specified the output is always a time stamp response (TimeStampResp),
otherwise it is a time stamp token (ContentInfo).
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl chain Ar certs_file.pem
The collection of PEM certificates
that will be included in the response
in addition to the signer certificate if the
.Fl cert
option was used for the request.
This file is supposed to contain the certificate chain
for the signer certificate from its issuer upwards.
The
.Fl reply
command does not build a certificate chain automatically.
.It Fl config Ar configfile
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl in Ar response.tsr
Specify a previously created time stamp response (or time stamp token, if
.Fl token_in
is also specified)
in DER format that will be written to the output file.
This option does not require a request;
it is useful, for example,
to examine the content of a response or token
or to extract the time stamp token from a response.
If the input is a token and the output is a time stamp response a default
.Qq granted
status info is added to the token.
.It Fl inkey Ar private.pem
The signer private key of the TSA in PEM format.
Overrides the
.Cm signer_key
config file option.
.It Fl out Ar response.tsr
The response is written to this file.
The format and content of the file depends on other options (see
.Fl text
and
.Fl token_out ) .
The default is stdout.
.It Fl passin Ar arg
The key password source.
.It Fl policy Ar object_id
The default policy to use for the response.
Either dotted OID notation or OID names defined
in the config file can be used.
If no policy is requested the TSA uses its own default policy.
.It Fl queryfile Ar request.tsq
The file containing a DER-encoded time stamp request.
.It Fl section Ar tsa_section
The config file section containing the settings for response generation.
.It Fl signer Ar tsa_cert.pem
The PEM signer certificate of the TSA.
The TSA signing certificate must have exactly one extended key usage
assigned to it: timeStamping.
The extended key usage must also be critical,
otherwise the certificate is going to be refused.
Overrides the
.Cm signer_cert
variable of the config file.
.It Fl text
Output in human-readable text format instead of DER.
.It Fl token_in
The input is a DER-encoded time stamp token (ContentInfo)
instead of a time stamp response (TimeStampResp).
.It Fl token_out
The output is a time stamp token (ContentInfo)
instead of a time stamp response (TimeStampResp).
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl verify
command is for verifying if a time stamp response or time stamp token
is valid and matches a particular time stamp request or data file.
The
.Fl verify
command does not use the configuration file.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl CAfile Ar trusted_certs.pem

The original time stamp request, in DER format.
The
.Fl data
and
.Fl digest
options must not be specified with this one.
.It Fl token_in
The input is a DER-encoded time stamp token (ContentInfo)
instead of a time stamp response (TimeStampResp).
.It Fl untrusted Ar cert_file.pem
Additional untrusted PEM certificates which may be needed
when building the certificate chain for the TSA's signing certificate.
This file must contain the TSA signing certificate and
all intermediate CA certificates unless the response includes them.

command line option.
.It Cm other_policies
Comma separated list of policies that are also acceptable by the TSA
and used only if the request explicitly specifies one of them.
.It Cm digests
The list of message digest algorithms that the TSA accepts.
At least one algorithm must be specified.
This parameter is mandatory.
.It Cm accuracy
The accuracy of the time source of the TSA in seconds, milliseconds
and microseconds.
For example, secs:1, millisecs:500, microsecs:100.
If any of the components is missing,
zero is assumed for that field.
.It Cm clock_precision_digits
The maximum number of digits, which represent the fraction of seconds,
that need to be included in the time field.
The trailing zeroes must be removed from the time,
so there might actually be fewer digits
or no fraction of seconds at all.
The maximum value is 6;
the default is 0.
.It Cm ordering
If this option is yes,
the responses generated by this TSA can always be ordered,
even if the time difference between two responses is less
than the sum of their accuracies.
The default is no.
.It Cm tsa_name
Set this option to yes if the subject name of the TSA must be included in
the TSA name field of the response.
The default is no.
.It Cm ess_cert_id_chain
The SignedData objects created by the TSA always contain the
certificate identifier of the signing certificate in a signed
attribute (see RFC 2634, Enhanced Security Services).
If this option is set to yes and either the
.Cm certs
variable or the
.Fl chain
option is specified then the certificate identifiers of the chain will also
be included in the SigningCertificate signed attribute.
If this variable is set to no,
only the signing certificate identifier is included.
The default is no.

.It Fl issuer_checks
Print diagnostics relating to searches for the issuer certificate
of the current certificate
showing why each candidate issuer certificate was rejected.
The presence of rejection messages
does not itself imply that anything is wrong:
during the normal verify process several rejections may take place.
.It Fl policy_check
Enable certificate policy processing.
.It Fl purpose Ar purpose
The intended use for the certificate.
Without this option no chain verification will be done.
Currently accepted uses are
.Cm sslclient , sslserver ,
.Cm nssslserver , smimesign ,
.Cm smimeencrypt , crlsign ,
.Cm any ,
and
.Cm ocsphelper .
.It Fl untrusted Ar file
A
.Ar file
of untrusted certificates.
The
.Ar file
should contain multiple certificates.
.It Fl verbose
Print extra information about the operations being performed.
.It Fl x509_strict
Disable workarounds for broken certificates which have to be disabled
for strict X.509 compliance.
.It Ar certificates
One or more PEM
.Ar certificates
to verify.
If no certificate files are included, an attempt is made to read
a certificate from standard input.
If the first certificate filename begins with a dash,
use a lone dash to mark the last option.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm verify
program uses the same functions as the internal SSL and S/MIME verification,
with one crucial difference:
wherever possible an attempt is made to continue after an error,
whereas normally the verify operation would halt on the first error.
This allows all the problems with a certificate chain to be determined.
.Pp
The verify operation consists of a number of separate steps.
Firstly a certificate chain is built up starting from the supplied certificate
and ending in the root CA.
It is an error if the whole chain cannot be built up.
The chain is built up by looking up the issuer's certificate of the current
certificate.
If a certificate is found which is its own issuer, it is assumed
to be the root CA.
.Pp
All certificates whose subject name matches the issuer name
of the current certificate are subject to further tests.
The relevant authority key identifier components of the current certificate
(if present) must match the subject key identifier (if present)
and issuer and serial number of the candidate issuer;
in addition the
.Cm keyUsage
extension of the candidate issuer (if present) must permit certificate signing.
.Pp
The lookup first looks in the list of untrusted certificates and if no match
is found the remaining lookups are from the trusted certificates.
The root CA is always looked up in the trusted certificate list:
if the certificate to verify is a root certificate,
then an exact match must be found in the trusted list.
.Pp
The second operation is to check every untrusted certificate's extensions for
consistency with the supplied purpose.
If the
.Fl purpose
option is not included, then no checks are done.
The supplied or
.Qq leaf
certificate must have extensions compatible with the supplied purpose
and all other certificates must also be valid CA certificates.
The precise extensions required are described in more detail in
the
.Nm X509
section below.
.Pp
The third operation is to check the trust settings on the root CA.
The root CA should be trusted for the supplied purpose.
A certificate with no trust settings is considered to be valid for
all purposes.
.Pp
The final operation is to check the validity of the certificate chain.
The validity period is checked against the current system time and the
.Cm notBefore
and
.Cm notAfter
dates in the certificate.
The certificate signatures are also checked at this point.
.Pp
If all operations complete successfully, the certificate is considered
valid.
If any operation fails then the certificate is not valid.
When a verify operation fails, the output messages can be somewhat cryptic.
The general form of the error message is:
.Bd -literal
server.pem: /C=AU/ST=Queensland/O=CryptSoft Pty Ltd/CN=Test CA (1024-bit)
error 24 at 1 depth lookup:invalid CA certificate
.Ed
.Pp
The first line contains the name of the certificate being verified, followed by
the subject name of the certificate.
The second line contains the error number and the depth.
The depth is the number of the certificate being verified when a
problem was detected starting with zero for the certificate being verified
itself, then 1 for the CA that signed the certificate and so on.
Finally a text version of the error number is presented.
.Pp
An exhaustive list of the error codes and messages is shown below; this also
includes the name of the error code as defined in the header file
.In openssl/x509_vfy.h .
Some of the error codes are defined but never returned: these are described as

.It Cm esc_msb
Escape characters with the MSB set; that is, with ASCII values larger than
127.
.It Cm multiline
A multiline format.
Equivalent to
.Cm esc_ctrl , esc_msb , sep_multiline ,
.Cm space_eq , lname ,
and
.Cm align .
.It Cm no_type
Do not attempt to interpret multibyte characters.
That is, content octets are merely dumped as though one octet
represents each character.
This is useful for diagnostic purposes
but results in rather odd looking output.
.It Cm nofname , sname , lname , oid
Alter how the field name is displayed:
.Cm nofname
does not display the field at all;
.Cm sname
uses the short name form (CN for
.Cm commonName ,
for example);
.Cm lname
uses the long form.
.Cm oid
represents the OID in numerical form and is useful for diagnostic purpose.
.It Cm oneline
A one line format which is more readable than
.Cm RFC2253 .
Equivalent to
.Cm esc_2253 , esc_ctrl , esc_msb , utf8 ,
.Cm dump_nostr , dump_der , use_quote , sep_comma_plus_spc ,

and
.Cm sname .
.It Cm RFC2253
Displays names compatible with RFC 2253.
Equivalent to
.Cm esc_2253 , esc_ctrl ,
.Cm esc_msb , utf8 , dump_nostr , dump_unknown ,
.Cm dump_der , sep_comma_plus , dn_rev ,
and
.Cm sname .
.It Cm sep_comma_plus , sep_comma_plus_space , sep_semi_plus_space , sep_multiline
Determine the field separators:
the first character is between RDNs and the second between multiple AVAs
(multiple AVAs are very rare and their use is discouraged).
The options ending in
.Qq space
additionally place a space after the separator to make it more readable.
.Cm sep_multiline
uses a linefeed character for the RDN separator and a spaced
.Sq +
for the AVA separator,
as well as indenting the fields by four characters.
.It Cm show_type
Show the type of the ASN.1 character string.
The type precedes the field contents.
For example
.Qq BMPSTRING: Hello World .
.It Cm space_eq
Place spaces round the
.Sq =
character which follows the field name.
.It Cm use_quote
Escape some characters by surrounding the whole string with
.Sq \&"
characters.
Without the option, all escaping is done with the
.Sq \e
character.
.It Cm utf8
Convert all strings to UTF8 format first, as required by RFC 2253.
On a UTF8 compatible terminal,
the use of this option (and not setting
.Cm esc_msb )
may result in the correct display of multibyte characters.
Usually, multibyte characters larger than 0xff
are represented using the format \eUXXXX for 16 bits and \eWXXXXXXXX
for 32 bits,
and any UTF8Strings are converted to their character form first.
.El
.It Fl noout
Do not output the encoded version of the request.
.It Fl ocsp_uri
Print the OCSP responder addresses, if any.
.It Fl ocspid
Print OCSP hash values for the subject name and public key.
.It Fl pubkey
Print the public key.
.It Fl serial
Print the certificate serial number.
.It Fl startdate
Print the start date of the certificate; that is, the
.Cm notBefore
date.
.It Fl subject
Print the subject name.
.It Fl subject_hash
Print the hash of the certificate subject name.
This is used in
.Nm openssl
to form an index to allow certificates in a directory to be looked up
by subject name.
.It Fl subject_hash_old
Print the hash of the certificate subject name
using the older algorithm as used by
.Nm openssl
versions before 1.0.0.
.It Fl text
Print the full certificate in text form.
.El
.Pp
A trusted certificate is a certificate which has several
additional pieces of information attached to it such as the permitted
and prohibited uses of the certificate and an alias.
When a certificate is being verified at least one certificate must be trusted.
By default, a trusted certificate must be stored locally and be a root CA.
The following are x509 trust settings options:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It Fl addreject Ar arg
Add a prohibited use.
Accepts the same values as the
.Fl addtrust
option.
.It Fl addtrust Ar arg
Add a trusted certificate use.
Any object name can be used here, but currently only
.Cm clientAuth
(SSL client use),
.Cm serverAuth
(SSL server use),
and
.Cm emailProtection
(S/MIME email) are used.
.It Fl alias
Output the certificate alias.
.It Fl clrreject
Clear all the prohibited or rejected uses of the certificate.
.It Fl clrtrust
Clear all the permitted or trusted uses of the certificate.
.It Fl purpose
Perform tests on the certificate extensions.
The same code is used when verifying untrusted certificates in chains,
so this section is useful if a chain is rejected by the verify code.
.Pp
The
.Cm basicConstraints
extension CA flag is used to determine whether the
certificate can be used as a CA.
If the CA flag is true, it is a CA;
if the CA flag is false, it is not a CA.
All CAs should have the CA flag set to true.
.Pp
If the
.Cm basicConstraints
extension is absent, then the certificate is
considered to be a possible CA;
other extensions are checked according to the intended use of the certificate.
A warning is given in this case because the certificate should really not
be regarded as a CA.
However it is allowed to be a CA to work around some broken software.
.Pp
If the certificate is a V1 certificate
(and thus has no extensions) and it is self-signed,
it is also assumed to be a CA but a warning is again given.
This is to work around the problem of Verisign roots
which are V1 self-signed certificates.
.Pp
If the
.Cm keyUsage
extension is present, then additional restraints are
made on the uses of the certificate.
A CA certificate must have the
.Cm keyCertSign
bit set if the
.Cm keyUsage
extension is present.
.Pp
The extended key usage extension places additional restrictions on the
certificate uses.
If this extension is present, whether critical or not,
the key can only be used for the purposes specified.
.Pp
A complete description of each test is given below.
The comments about
.Cm basicConstraints
and
.Cm keyUsage
and V1 certificates above apply to all CA certificates.
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It SSL Client
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the
web client authentication OID.
.Cm keyUsage
must be absent or it must have the
.Cm digitalSignature
bit set.
The Netscape certificate type must be absent
or it must have the SSL client bit set.
.It SSL Client CA
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the
web client authentication OID.
The Netscape certificate type must be absent
or it must have the SSL CA bit set:
this is used as a workaround if the
.Cm basicConstraints
extension is absent.
.It SSL Server
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the
web server authentication and/or one of the SGC OIDs.
.Cm keyUsage
must be absent or it must have the
.Cm digitalSignature
set, the
.Cm keyEncipherment
set, or both bits set.
The Netscape certificate type must be absent or have the SSL server bit set.
.It SSL Server CA
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the
web server authentication and/or one of the SGC OIDs.
The Netscape certificate type must be absent or the SSL CA bit must be set:
this is used as a workaround if the
.Cm basicConstraints
extension is absent.
.It Netscape SSL Server
For Netscape SSL clients to connect to an SSL server; it must have the
.Cm keyEncipherment
bit set if the
.Cm keyUsage
extension is present.
This isn't always valid because some cipher suites use the key for
digital signing.
Otherwise it is the same as a normal SSL server.
.It Common S/MIME Client Tests
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the
email protection OID.
The Netscape certificate type must be absent or should have the S/MIME bit set.
If the S/MIME bit is not set in Netscape certificate type, then the SSL
client bit is tolerated as an alternative but a warning is shown:
this is because some Verisign certificates don't set the S/MIME bit.
.It S/MIME Signing
In addition to the common S/MIME client tests, the
.Cm digitalSignature
bit must be set if the
.Cm keyUsage
extension is present.
.It S/MIME Encryption
In addition to the common S/MIME tests, the
.Cm keyEncipherment
bit must be set if the
.Cm keyUsage
extension is present.
.It S/MIME CA
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the
email protection OID.
The Netscape certificate type must be absent
or must have the S/MIME CA bit set:
this is used as a workaround if the
.Cm basicConstraints
extension is absent.
.It CRL Signing
The
.Cm keyUsage
extension must be absent or it must have the CRL signing bit set.
.It CRL Signing CA
The normal CA tests apply, except the
.Cm basicConstraints
extension must be present.
.El
.It Fl setalias Ar arg
Set the alias of the certificate,
allowing the certificate to be referred to using a nickname,
such as
.Qq Steve's Certificate .
.It Fl trustout
Output a trusted certificate
(the default if any trust settings are modified).
An ordinary or trusted certificate can be input, but by default an ordinary
certificate is output and any trust settings are discarded.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm x509
utility can be used to sign certificates and requests:
it can thus behave like a mini CA.
The following are x509 signing options:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It Fl CA Ar file
The CA certificate to be used for signing.
When this option is present,
.Nm x509
behaves like a mini CA.
The input file is signed by the CA using this option;
that is, its issuer name is set to the subject name of the CA and it is
digitally signed using the CA's private key.
.Pp
This option is normally combined with the
.Fl req
option.
Without the
.Fl req
option, the input is a certificate which must be self-signed.
.It Fl CAcreateserial
Create the CA serial number file if it does not exist
instead of generating an error.
The file will contain the serial number
.Sq 02
and the certificate being signed will have
.Sq 1
as its serial number.
.It Fl CAform Cm der | pem
The format of the CA certificate file.
The default is
.Cm pem .
.It Fl CAkey Ar file
Set the CA private key to sign a certificate with.
Otherwise it is assumed that the CA private key is present
in the CA certificate file.
.It Fl CAkeyform Cm der | pem
The format of the CA private key.
The default is
.Cm pem .
.It Fl CAserial Ar file
Use the serial number in
.Ar file
to sign a certificate.
The file should consist of one line containing an even number of hex digits
with the serial number to use.
After each use the serial number is incremented and written out
to the file again.
.Pp
The default filename consists of the CA certificate file base name with
.Pa .srl
appended.
For example, if the CA certificate file is called
.Pa mycacert.pem ,
it expects to find a serial number file called
.Pa mycacert.srl .
.It Fl checkend Ar arg
Check whether the certificate expires in the next
.Ar arg
seconds.
If so, exit with return value 1;
otherwise exit with return value 0.
.It Fl clrext
Delete any extensions from a certificate.
This option is used when a certificate is being created from another
certificate (for example with the
.Fl signkey
or the
.Fl CA
options).
Normally, all extensions are retained.
.It Fl days Ar arg
The number of days to make a certificate valid for.
The default is 30 days.
.It Fl extensions Ar section
The section to add certificate extensions from.
If this option is not specified, the extensions should either be
contained in the unnamed (default) section
or the default section should contain a variable called
.Qq extensions
which contains the section to use.
.It Fl extfile Ar file
File containing certificate extensions to use.
If not specified, no extensions are added to the certificate.
.It Fl keyform Cm der | pem
The format of the private key file used in the
.Fl signkey
option.
.It Fl req
Expect a certificate request on input instead of a certificate.
.It Fl set_serial Ar n
The serial number to use.
This option can be used with either the
.Fl signkey
or
.Fl CA
options.
If used in conjunction with the
.Fl CA
option, the serial number file (as specified by the
.Fl CAserial
or
.Fl CAcreateserial
options) is not used.
.Pp
The serial number can be decimal or hex (if preceded by
.Sq 0x ) .
Negative serial numbers can also be specified but their use is not recommended.
.It Fl signkey Ar file
Self-sign
.Ar file
using the supplied private key.
.Pp
If the input file is a certificate, it sets the issuer name to the
subject name (i.e. makes it self-signed),
changes the public key to the supplied value,
and changes the start and end dates.
The start date is set to the current time and the end date is set to
a value determined by the
.Fl days
option.
Any certificate extensions are retained unless the
.Fl clrext
option is supplied.
.Pp
If the input is a certificate request, a self-signed certificate
is created using the supplied private key using the subject name in
the request.
.It Fl x509toreq
Convert a certificate into a certificate request.
The
.Fl signkey
option is used to pass the required private key.
.El
.Sh COMMON NOTATION
Several commands share a common syntax,
as detailed below.
.Pp
Password arguments, typically specified using
.Fl passin
and
.Fl passout
for input and output passwords,
allow passwords to be obtained from a variety of sources.
Both of these options take a single argument, described below.
If no password argument is given and a password is required,
then the user is prompted to enter one:
this will typically be read from the current terminal with echoing turned off.
.Bl -tag -width "pass:password" -offset indent
.It Cm pass : Ns Ar password
The actual password is
.Ar password .
Since the password is visible to utilities,
this form should only be used where security is not important.
.It Cm env : Ns Ar var
Obtain the password from the environment variable
.Ar var .
Since the environment of other processes is visible,
this option should be used with caution.
.It Cm file : Ns Ar path
The first line of
.Ar path
is the password.
If the same
.Ar path
argument is supplied to
.Fl passin
and
.Fl passout ,
then the first line will be used for the input password and the next line
for the output password.
.Ar path
need not refer to a regular file:
it could, for example, refer to a device or named pipe.
.It Cm fd : Ns Ar number
Read the password from the file descriptor
.Ar number .
This can be used to send the data via a pipe, for example.
.It Cm stdin
Read the password from standard input.
.El
.Pp
Input/output formats,
typically specified using
.Fl inform
and
.Fl outform ,
indicate the format being read from or written to.
The argument is case insensitive.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Cm der
Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
is a binary format.
.It Cm net
Insecure legacy format.
.It Cm pem
Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
is base64-encoded.
.It Cm smime
An SMIME format message.
.It Cm txt
Plain ASCII text.
