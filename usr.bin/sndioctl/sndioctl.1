.Sh NAME
.Nm sndioctl
.Nd manipulate audio device controls
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Op Fl dimnqv
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Ar command ...
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can display or manipulate controls of
.Xr sndio 7
audio devices, like the output level.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Dump the raw list of available controls and exit.
Useful as a debugging tool.
.It Fl f Ar device
Use this
.Xr sndio 7
audio device.
.It Fl i
Display characteristics of requested controls
instead of their values.
.It Fl m
Monitor and display audio controls changes.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the variable name.
.It Fl q
Suppress all printing when setting a variable.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose mode, a.k.a. multi-channel mode.
By default controls affecting different channels
of the same stream are disguised as a single mono
control to hide details that are not essential.
.El
.Pp
If no commands are specified all valid controls are displayed on
.Em stdout .
Unless
.Fl d ,
.Fl m ,
.Fl n ,
or
.Fl i
are used, displayed lines are valid commands.
The set of available controls depends on the audio device.
.Pp
Commands use the following two formats to display and change
controls respectively:
.Pp
.Dl group/stream[channel].function
.Dl group/stream[channel].function=value
.Pp
On the left-hand side are specified the control group (if any),
the affected stream name, and the optional channel number.
Examples of left-hand side terms:
.Pp
.Dl output.level
.Dl output[0].level
.Pp
If the channel number (including the brackets) is omitted,
the command is applied to all channels.
.Pp
Values are numbers between 0 and 1.
Two-state controls (switches) take either 0 or 1 as value,
typically corresponding to the
.Em off
and
.Em on
states respectively.
.Pp
If a decimal is prefixed by the plus (minus) sign then
the given value is added to (subtracted from) the
current value of the control.
If
.Qq \&!
is used instead of a number, then the switch is toggled.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Increase the
.Cm level
control affecting all
.Cm output
channels by 10% of the maximum:
.Pp
.Dl $ sndioctl output.level=+0.1
.Pp
Mute all
.Cm output
channels:
.Pp
.Dl $ sndioctl output.mute=1
.Pp
Toggle the above
.Cm mute
control:
.Pp
.Dl $ sndioctl output.mute=!
.Pp
Allow audio recording and set all
.Cm input
channels to 50%:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysctl kern.audio.record=1
$ sndioctl input.mute=0 input.level=0.5
