.Sh NAME
.Nm col
.Nd filter reverse line feeds and backspaces from input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm col
.Op Fl bfhx
.Op Fl l Ar num
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
filters out reverse (and half-reverse) line feeds so that the output is
in the correct order with only forward and half-forward line
feeds, and replaces whitespace characters with tabs where possible.
.Pp
.Nm
reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Do not output any backspaces, printing only the last character
written to each column position.
This can be useful in processing the output of
.Xr mandoc 1 .
.It Fl f
Forward half-line feeds are permitted
.Pf ( Ns Dq fine
mode).
Normally characters printed on a half-line boundary are printed
on the following line.
.It Fl h
Compress spaces into tabs.
This is the default behavior.
.It Fl l Ar num
Buffer at least
.Ar num
lines in memory.
By default, 128 lines are buffered.
.It Fl x
Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.
.El
.Pp
The control sequences for carriage motion that
.Nm
understands and their decimal values are listed in the following
table:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "carriage return" -compact
.It ESC\-7
Reverse line feed (escape then 7).
.It ESC\-10
Half reverse line feed (escape then 10).
.It ESC\-11
Half forward line feed (escape then 11).
.It backspace
Moves back one column (8); ignored in the first column.
.It carriage return
(13)
.It newline
Forward line feed (10); also does carriage return.
.It shift in
Shift to normal character set (15).
.It shift out
Shift to alternate character set (14).
.It space
Moves forward one column (32).
.It tab
Moves forward to next tab stop (9).
.It vertical tab
Reverse line feed (11).
.El
.Pp
All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences are
discarded.
.Pp
.Nm
keeps track of the character set as characters are read and makes
sure the character set is correct when they are output.
.Pp
If the input attempts to back up to the last flushed line,
.Nm
will display a warning message.
