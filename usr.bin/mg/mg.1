.Sh NAME
.Nm mg
.Nd emacs-like text editor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mg
.Op Fl nR
.Op Fl b Ar file
.Op Fl f Ar mode
.Op Fl u Ar file
.Op + Ns Ar number
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for
people who can't (or don't want to) run emacs for one
reason or another, or are not familiar with the
.Xr vi 1
editor.
It is compatible with emacs because there shouldn't
be any reason to learn more editor types than emacs or
.Xr vi 1 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It + Ns Ar number
Go to the line specified by number (do not insert
a space between the
.Sq +
sign and the number).
If a negative number is specified, the line number counts
backwards from the end of the file i.e. +-1 will be the last
line of the file, +-2 will be second last, and so on.
.It Fl b Ar file
Turn on batch mode and execute the
.Nm
commands found in the specified
.Ar file
and then terminate.
.It Fl f Ar mode
Run the
.Ar mode
command for all buffers created from
arguments on the command line, including the
scratch buffer and all files.
.It Fl n
Turn off backup file generation.
.It Fl R
Files specified on the command line will be opened read-only.
.It Fl u Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as the startup file, instead of the default
.Pa ~/.mg .
.El
.Sh WINDOWS AND BUFFERS
When a file is loaded into
.Nm ,
it is stored in a
.Em buffer .
This buffer may be displayed on the screen in more than one window.
At present, windows may only be split horizontally, so each window is
delineated by a modeline at the bottom.
If changes are made to a buffer, it will be reflected in all open windows.
.Pp
If a file is changed outside
.Nm
and its buffer is about to be changed,
.Nm
prompts if the change should go ahead (y), not go ahead (n) or if the buffer
should be reverted (r) to the latest file on disk.
.Pp
If a buffer name begins and ends with an asterisk, the buffer is considered
throwaway; i.e. the user will not be prompted to save changes when
the buffer is killed.
.Sh POINT AND MARK
The current cursor location in
.Nm
is called the
.Em point
(or
.Em dot ) .
It is possible to define a window-specific region of text by setting a second
location, called the
.Em mark .
The
.Em region
is the text between point and mark inclusive.
Deleting the character at the mark position leaves
the mark at the point of deletion.
.Pp
Note: The point and mark are window-specific in
.Nm ,
not buffer-specific, as in other emacs flavours.
.Sh BACKUP FILES
Backup files have a
.Sq ~
character appended to the file name and
are created in the current working directory by default.
Whether to create backup files or not can be toggled with the
.Ic make-backup-files
command.
The backup file location can either be in the current
working directory, or all backups can be moved to a
.Pa ~/.mg.d
directory where files retain their path name to retain uniqueness.
Use the
.Ic backup-to-home-directory
command to alternate between these two locations.
Further, if any application creates backup files in
.Pa /tmp ,
these can be left with the
.Ic leave-tmpdir-backups
command.
.Sh TAGS
.Nm
supports tag files created by
.Xr ctags 1 ,
allowing the user to quickly locate various object definitions.
Note though that emacs uses etags, not ctags.
.Sh CSCOPE
.Nm
supports navigating source code using cscope.
However,
.Nm
requires cscope and cscope-indexer executables to be present in
.Ev PATH
for it to work.
.Sh DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS
Normal editing commands are very similar to GNU Emacs.
In the following examples, C-x means Control-x, and M-x means Meta-x,
where the Meta key may be either a special key on the keyboard
or the ALT key; otherwise ESC followed by the key X works as well.

For a complete description of
.Nm
commands, see
.Sx MG COMMANDS .
To see the active keybindings at any time, type
.Dq M-x describe-bindings .
.Sh MG COMMANDS
Commands are invoked by
.Dq M-x ,
or by binding to a key.
Many commands take an optional numerical parameter,
.Va n .
This parameter is set either by
M-<n> (where
.Va n
is the numerical argument) before the command, or by
one or more invocations of the universal argument, usually bound to C-u.
When invoked in this manner, the value of the numeric parameter to
be passed is displayed in the minibuffer before the M-x.
One common use of the parameter is in mode toggles (e.g.\&
make-backup-files).
If no parameter is supplied, the mode is toggled to its
alternate state.
If a positive parameter is supplied, the mode is forced to on.
Otherwise, it is forced to off.

deletes all the blank lines above and below the current line.

.Ic find-file ,
except the new buffer is set to read-only.
.It Ic find-alternate-file

of the line, unless it is at the end of the line, when it kills the
newline.
If called with an argument of 0, it kills from the start of the
line to dot.
If called with a positive argument, it kills from dot
forward over that number of newlines.

.Sh CONFIGURATION FILES
There are two configuration files,
.Pa .mg
and
.Pa .mg-TERM .
Here,
.Ev TERM
represents the name of the terminal type; e.g. if the terminal type
is set to
.Dq vt100 ,
.Nm
will use
.Pa .mg-vt100
as a startup file.
The terminal type startup file is used first.
.Pp
The startup file format is a list of commands, one per line, as used for
interactive evaluation.
Strings that are normally entered by the user at any subsequent prompts
may be specified after the command name; e.g.:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
global-set-key ")" self-insert-command
global-set-key "\e^x\e^f" find-file
global-set-key "\ee[Z" backward-char
set-default-mode fill
set-fill-column 72
auto-execute *.c c-mode
.Ed
.Pp
Comments can be added to the startup files by placing
.Sq ;\&
or
.Sq #
as the first character of a line.

.Sh CAVEATS
Since it is written completely in C, there is currently no
language in which extensions can be written;
however, keys can be rebound and certain parameters can be changed
in startup files.
.Pp
In order to use 8-bit characters (such as German umlauts), the Meta key
needs to be disabled via the
.Ic meta-key-mode
command.
.Pp
Multi-byte character sets, such as UTF-8, are not supported.
