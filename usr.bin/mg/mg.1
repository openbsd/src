.Sh NAME
.Nm mg
.Nd emacs-like text editor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mg
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl f Ar mode
.Op + Ns Ar number
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for
people who can't (or don't want to) run emacs for one
reason or another, or are not familiar with the
.Xr vi 1
editor.
It is compatible with emacs because there shouldn't
be any reason to learn more editor types than emacs or
.Xr vi 1 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It + Ns Ar number
Go to the line specified by number (do not insert
a space between the
.Sq +
sign and the number).
If a negative number is specified, the line number counts
backwards from the end of the file i.e. +-1 will be the last
line of the file, +-2 will be second last, and so on.
.It Fl f Ar mode
Run the mode command for all buffers created from
arguments on the command line, including the
scratch buffer and all files.
.It Fl n
Turn off backup file generation.
.El
.Sh WINDOWS AND BUFFERS
When a file is loaded into
.Nm ,
it is stored in a
.Em buffer .
This buffer may be displayed on the screen in more than one window.
At present, windows may only be split horizontally, so each window is
delineated by a modeline at the bottom.
If changes are made to a buffer, it will be reflected in all open windows.
.Pp
If a buffer name begins and ends with an asterisk, the buffer is considered
throwaway; i.e. the user will not be prompted to save changes when
the buffer is killed.
.Sh POINT AND MARK
The current cursor location in
.Nm
is called the
.Em point
(or
.Em dot ) .
It is possible to define a window-specific region of text by setting a second
location, called the
.Em mark .
The
.Em region
is the text between point and mark inclusive.
Deleting the character at the mark position leaves
the mark at the point of deletion.
.Pp
Note: The point and mark are window-specific in
.Nm ,
not buffer-specific, as in other emacs flavours.
.Sh DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS
Normal editing commands are very similar to GNU Emacs.
In the following examples, C-x means Control-x, and M-x means Meta-x,
where the Meta key may be either a special key on your keyboard
or the ALT key; otherwise ESC followed by the key X works as well.

For a complete description of
.Nm
commands, see
.Sx MG COMMANDS .
To see the active keybindings at any time, type
.Dq M-x describe-bindings .
.Sh MG COMMANDS
Commands are invoked by
.Dq M-x ,
or by binding to a key.
Many commands take an optional numerical parameter,
.Va n .
This parameter is set either by
M-<n> (where
.Va n
is the numerical argument) before the command, or by
one or more invocations of the universal argument, usually bound to C-U.
When invoked in this manner, the value of the numeric parameter to
be passed is displayed in the minibuffer before the M-x.
One common use of the parameter is in mode toggles (e.g.\&
make-backup-files).
If no parameter is supplied, the mode is toggled to its
alternate state.
If a positive parameter is supplied, the mode is forced to on.
Otherwise, it is forced to off.
.\"

.It apropos
Help Apropos.
Prompt the user for a string, open the *help* buffer,
and list all
.Nm
commands that contain that string.
.It auto-execute

(conforming to the shell's filename globbing rules) and an associated
function to execute when a file matching the specified pattern
is read into a buffer.
.It auto-fill-mode
Toggle auto-fill mode (sometimes called mail-mode),
where text inserted past the fill column is automatically wrapped
to a new line.

Move cursor to the top of the buffer.
.It beginning-of-line
Move cursor to the beginning of the line.

.It c-mode
Toggle a KNF-compliant mode for editing C program files.
.It call-last-kbd-macro

a key, and an
.Nm
command, then creates a keybinding in the appropriate
map.
.It delete-backward-char
Delete backwards
.Va n
characters.
Like delete-char, this actually does a kill if presented
with an argument.

autocompletion to it.
When it comes back, look the name up in the symbol table and run the
command if it is found, passing arguments as necessary.
Print an error if there is anything wrong.
.It fill-paragraph
Justify a paragraph, wrapping text at the current fill column.
.It find-file
Select a file for editing.
First check if you can find the file
in another buffer; if you can find it, just switch to the buffer.
If you cannot find the file, create a new buffer, read in the
file from disk, and switch to the new buffer.
.It find-file-read-only
Same as find-file, except the new buffer is set to read-only.
.It find-alternate-file
Replace the current file with an alternate one.
Semantics for finding the replacement file are the same as
find-file, except the current buffer is killed before the switch.
If the kill fails, or is aborted, revert to the original file.

When enabled,
.Nm
defaults to opening files (and executing commands like compile and grep)
relative to the global working directory.
When disabled, a working directory is set for each buffer.
.It goto-line
Go to a specific line.
If an argument is present, then
it is the line number, else prompt for a line number to use.

isearch ignores any explicit arguments.
If invoked during macro definition or evaluation, the non-incremental
search-backward is invoked instead.
.It isearch-forward
Use incremental searching, initially in the forward direction.
isearch ignores any explicit arguments.
If invoked during macro definition or evaluation, the non-incremental
search-forward is invoked instead.

of the line, unless it is at the end of the line, when it kills the
newline.
If called with an argument of 0, it kills from the start of the
line to dot.
If called with a positive argument, it kills from dot
forward over that number of newlines.
If called with a negative argument
it kills any text before dot on the current line, then it kills back
abs(n) lines.

If found, dot is left
pointing at the first character of the pattern [the last character that
was matched].
.It re-search-forward
Search forward using a regular expression.
Get a search string from the user and search for it starting at dot.
If found, move dot to just after the matched characters.
display does all
the hard stuff.

.It search-again
Search again, using the same search string and direction as the last
search command.
.It search-backward
Reverse search.
Get a search string from the user, and search, starting
at dot and proceeding toward the front of the buffer.
If found, dot is
left pointing at the first character of the pattern (the last character
that was matched).
.It search-forward
Search forward.
Get a search string from the user, and search for it
starting at dot.
If found, dot gets moved to just after the matched
characters, if not found, print a message.
.It self-insert-command
Insert a character.
.It set-case-fold-search
Set case-fold searching, causing case nopt to matter
in regular expression searches.

.It toggle-read-only
Toggle the read-only flag on the current buffer.
.It transpose-chars
Transpose the two characters on either side of dot.
If dot is at the end of the line, transpose the two characters before it.
Return with an error if dot is at the beginning of line;
it seems to be a bit pointless to
make this work.
.It undo
Undo the most recent action.
If invoked again without an intervening command,
move the undo pointer to the previous action and undo it.
.It undo-boundary
Add an undo boundary.
This is not usually done interactively.
.It undo-boundary-toggle
Toggle whether undo boundaries are generated.
Undo boundaries are often disabled before operations that should
be considered atomically undoable.
.It undo-enable
Toggle whether undo information is kept.
.It undo-list
Show the undo records for the current buffer in a new buffer.
.It universal-argument

upper case.
.It upcase-word
Move the cursor forward by the specified number of words.
As you move, convert any characters to upper case.
.It what-cursor-position
Display a bunch of useful information about the current location of
dot.
The character under the cursor (in octal), the current line, row,
and column, and approximate position of the cursor in the file (as a
percentage) is displayed.
The column position assumes an infinite
position display; it does not truncate just because the screen does.
.It write-file
Ask for a file name and write the contents of the current buffer to
that file.
Update the remembered file name and clear the buffer
changed flag.
.It yank
Yank text from kill-buffer.
Unlike emacs, the
.Nm
kill buffer consists only
of the most recent kill.
It is not a ring.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILES
There are two configuration files,
.Pa .mg ,
and
.Pa .mg-TERM .
Here,
.Ev TERM
represents the name of your terminal type; e.g., if your terminal type
is set to
.Dq vt100 ,
.Nm
will use
.Pa .mg-vt100
as a startup file.
The terminal type startup file is used first.
.Pp
The startup file format is a list of commands, one per line, as used for
interactive evaluation.
Strings that are normally entered by the user at any subsequent prompts
may be specified after the command name; e.g.:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
global-set-key ")" self-insert-command
global-set-key "\e^x\e^f" find-file
global-set-key "\ee[Z" backward-char
set-default-mode fill
set-fill-column 72

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vi 1
.Sh CAVEATS
Since it is written completely in C, there is currently no
language in which you can write extensions;
however, you can rebind keys and change certain parameters
in startup files.
.Pp
In order to use 8-bit characters (such as German umlauts), the Meta key
needs to be disabled via the
.Dq meta-key-mode
command.
