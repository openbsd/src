.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mdoc
library parses lines of
.Xr mdoc 7
input (and
.Em only
mdoc) into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
In general, applications initiate a parsing sequence with
.Fn mdoc_alloc ,
parse each line in a document with
.Fn mdoc_parseln ,
close the parsing session with
.Fn mdoc_endparse ,
operate over the syntax tree returned by
.Fn mdoc_node
and
.Fn mdoc_meta ,
then free all allocated memory with
.Fn mdoc_free .
The
.Fn mdoc_reset
function may be used in order to reset the parser for another input
sequence.  See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for a full example.
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
This section further defines the
.Sx Types ,
.Sx Functions
and
.Sx Variables
available to programmers.  Following that, the
.Sx Abstract Syntax Tree
section documents the output tree.
.\" SUBSECTION
.Ss Types
Both functions (see
.Sx Functions )
and variables (see
.Sx Variables )
may use the following types:
.Bl -ohang
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Vt struct mdoc
An opaque type defined in
.Pa mdoc.c .
Its values are only used privately within the library.
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Vt struct mdoc_cb
A set of message callbacks defined in
.Pa mdoc.h .
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Vt struct mdoc_node
A parsed node.  Defined in
.Pa mdoc.h .
See
.Sx Abstract Syntax Tree
for details.
.El
.\" SUBSECTION
.Ss Functions
Function descriptions follow:
.Bl -ohang
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Fn mdoc_alloc
Allocates a parsing structure.  The
.Fa data
pointer is passed to callbacks in
.Fa cb ,
which are documented further in the header file.
The
.Fa pflags
arguments are defined in
.Pa mdoc.h .
Returns NULL on failure.  If non-NULL, the pointer must be freed with
.Fn mdoc_free .
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Fn mdoc_reset
Reset the parser for another parse routine.  After its use,
.Fn mdoc_parseln
behaves as if invoked for the first time.  If it returns 0, memory could
not be allocated.
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Fn mdoc_free
Free all resources of a parser.  The pointer is no longer valid after
invocation.
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Fn mdoc_parseln
Parse a nil-terminated line of input.  This line should not contain the
trailing newline.  Returns 0 on failure, 1 on success.  The input buffer
.Fa buf
is modified by this function.
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Fn mdoc_endparse
Signals that the parse is complete.  Note that if
.Fn mdoc_endparse
is called subsequent to
.Fn mdoc_node ,
the resulting tree is incomplete.  Returns 0 on failure, 1 on success.
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Fn mdoc_node
Returns the first node of the parse.  Note that if
.Fn mdoc_parseln
or
.Fn mdoc_endparse
return 0, the tree will be incomplete.
.It Fn mdoc_meta
Returns the document's parsed meta-data.  If this information has not
yet been supplied or
.Fn mdoc_parseln
or
.Fn mdoc_endparse
return 0, the data will be incomplete.
.El
.\" SUBSECTION
.Ss Variables
The following variables are also defined:
.Bl -ohang
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Va mdoc_macronames
An array of string-ified token names.
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It Va mdoc_argnames
An array of string-ified token argument names.
.El
.\" SUBSECTION
.Ss Abstract Syntax Tree
The
.Nm
functions produce an abstract syntax tree (AST) describing input in a
regular form.  It may be reviewed at any time with
.Fn mdoc_nodes ;
however, if called before
.Fn mdoc_endparse ,
or after
.Fn mdoc_endparse
or
.Fn mdoc_parseln
fail, it may be incomplete.
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
This AST is governed by the ontological
rules dictated in
.Xr mdoc 7
and derives its terminology accordingly.
.Qq In-line
elements described in
.Xr mdoc 7
are described simply as
.Qq elements .
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
The AST is composed of
.Vt struct mdoc_node
nodes with block, head, body, element, root and text types as declared
by the
.Va type
field.  Each node also provides its parse point (the
.Va line ,
.Va sec ,
and
.Va pos
fields), its position in the tree (the
.Va parent ,
.Va child ,
.Va next
and
.Va prev
fields) and some type-specific data.
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
The tree itself is arranged according to the following normal form,
where capitalised non-terminals represent nodes.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "ELEMENTXX" -compact
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It ROOT
\(<- mnode+
.It mnode
\(<- BLOCK | ELEMENT | TEXT
.It BLOCK
\(<- (HEAD [TEXT])+ [BODY [TEXT]] [TAIL [TEXT]]
.It BLOCK
\(<- BODY [TEXT] [TAIL [TEXT]]
.It ELEMENT
\(<- TEXT*
.It HEAD
\(<- mnode+
.It BODY
\(<- mnode+
.It TAIL
\(<- mnode+
.It TEXT
\(<- [[:alpha:]]*
.El
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
Of note are the TEXT nodes following the HEAD, BODY and TAIL nodes of
the BLOCK production.  These refer to punctuation marks.  Furthermore,
although a TEXT node will generally have a non-zero-length string, in
the specific case of
.Sq \&.Bd \-literal ,
an empty line will produce a zero-length string.
.\" SECTION
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example reads lines from stdin and parses them, operating
on the finished parse tree with
.Fn parsed .
This example does not error-check nor free memory upon failure.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct mdoc *mdoc;
const struct mdoc_node *node;
char *buf;
size_t len;
int line;

line = 1;
mdoc = mdoc_alloc(NULL, 0, NULL);
buf = NULL;
alloc_len = 0;

while ((len = getline(&buf, &alloc_len, stdin)) >= 0) {
    if (len && buflen[len - 1] = '\en')
        buf[len - 1] = '\e0';
    if ( ! mdoc_parseln(mdoc, line, buf))
        errx(1, "mdoc_parseln");
    line++;
}

if ( ! mdoc_endparse(mdoc))
    errx(1, "mdoc_endparse");
if (NULL == (node = mdoc_node(mdoc)))
    errx(1, "mdoc_node");

parsed(mdoc, node);
mdoc_free(mdoc);
