.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mandoc
.Op Fl f Ns Ar option...
.Op Fl m Ns Ar format
.Op Fl W Ns Ar err...
.Op Fl T Ns Ar output
.Op Ar infile...
.\" SECTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility formats 
.Ux
manual pages for display.  The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX
.\" ITEM
.It Fl f Ns Ar option...
Override default compiler behaviour.  See 
.Sx Compiler Options
for details.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl m Ns Ar format
Input format.  See
.Sx Input Formats
for available formats.  Defaults to
.Fl m Ns Ar andoc .
.\" ITEM
.It Fl T Ns Ar output
Output format.  See
.Sx Output Formats
for available formats.  Defaults to
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii .
.\" ITEM
.It Fl W Ns Ar err...
Print warning messages.  May be set to 
.Fl W Ns Ar all
for all warnings, 
.Ar compat
for groff/troff-compatibility warnings, or
.Ar syntax
for syntax warnings.  If
.Fl W Ns Ar error 
is specified, warnings are considered errors and cause utility
termination.  Multiple 
.Fl W
arguments may be comma-separated, such as
.Fl W Ns Ar error,all .
.\" ITEM
.It Ar infile...
Read input from zero or more
.Ar infile .
If unspecified, reads from stdin.  If multiple files are specified,
.Nm
will halt with the first failed parse.
.El
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
By default, 
.Nm 
reads 
.Xr mdoc 7
or
.Xr man 7
text from stdin, implying
.Fl m Ns Ar andoc ,
and prints 78-column backspace-encoded output to stdout as if
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii
were provided.
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
.Ex -std mandoc
.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Punctuation
If punctuation is set apart from words, such as in the phrase
.Dq to be \&, or not to be ,
it's processed by
.Nm
according to the following rules.  Opening punctuation
.Po
.Sq \&( , 
.Sq \&[ , 
and
.Sq \&{
.Pc 
is not followed by a space. Closing punctuation
.Po
.Sq \&. , 
.Sq \&, , 
.Sq \&; , 
.Sq \&: , 
.Sq \&? , 
.Sq \&! , 
.Sq \&) , 
.Sq \&] 
and
.Sq \&}
.Pc 
is not preceeded by whitespace.
.Pp
If the input is
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
these rules are also applied to macro arguments when appropriate.
.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Input Formats
The
.Nm
utility accepts
.Xr mdoc 7
and
.Xr man 7
input with
.Fl m Ns Ar doc
and
.Fl m Ns Ar an ,
respectively.  The
.Xr mdoc 7
format is
.Em strongly
recommended; 
.Xr man 7
should only be used for legacy manuals.
.Pp
A third option,
.Fl m Ns Ar andoc ,
which is also the default, determines encoding on-the-fly: if the first
non-comment macro is 
.Sq \&.Dd
or
.Sq \&.Dt ,
the 
.Xr mdoc 7
parser is used; otherwise, the
.Xr man 7
parser is used.
.Pp
If multiple
files are specified with 
.Fl m Ns Ar andoc , 
each has its file-type determined this way.  If multiple files are
specified and
.Fl m Ns Ar doc
or
.Fl m Ns Ar an
is specified, then this format is used exclusively.
.\" .Pp
.\" The following escape sequences are recognised, although the per-format
.\" compiler may not allow certain sequences.
.\" .Bl -tag -width Ds -offset XXXX
.\" .It \efX
.\" sets the font mode to X (B, I, R or P, where P resets the font)
.\" .It \eX, \e(XX, \e[XN]
.\" queries the special-character table for a corresponding symbol
.\" .It \e*X, \e*(XX, \e*[XN]
.\" deprecated special-character format
.\" .El
.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Output Formats
The
.Nm
utility accepts the following
.Fl T
arguments:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX 
.It Fl T Ns Ar ascii
Produce 7-bit ASCII output, backspace-encoded for bold and underline
styles.  This is the default.
.It Fl T Ns Ar tree
Produce an indented parse tree.
.It Fl T Ns Ar lint
Parse only: produce no output.
.El
.Pp
If multiple input files are specified, these will be processed by the
corresponding filter in-order.
.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Compiler Options
Default compiler behaviour may be overriden with the
.Fl f
flag.
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-scope
When rewinding the scope of a block macro, forces the compiler to ignore
scope violations.  This can seriously mangle the resulting tree.
.Pq mdoc only
.It Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-escape
Don't ignore invalid escape sequences.
.It Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-macro
Do not ignore unknown macros at the start of input lines.
.It Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-chars
Do not ignore disallowed characters.
.It Fl f Ns Ar strict
Implies 
.Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-escape ,
.Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-macro 
and
.Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-chars . 
.El
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
As with the
.Fl W
flag, multiple
.Fl f
options may be grouped and delimited with a comma.  Using
.Fl f Ns Ar ign-scope,no-ign-escape ,
for example, will try to ignore scope and not ignore character-escape
errors.

.Sh CAVEATS
The 
.Nm
utility in
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii
mode doesn't yet know how to display the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
The \-hang 
.Sq \&.Bl
list is not yet supported.
.El
.Pp
Other macros still aren't supported by virtue of nobody complaining
about their absence.  Please report any omissions: this is a work in
progress.
.Pp
The following list documents differences between traditional
.Xr nroff 1
output and
.Nm :
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It 
A list of display following
.Sq \&.Ss
does not assert a prior vertical break, just as it doesn't with
.Sq \&.Sh .
.It
Special characters don't follow the current font style.
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It
The \-literal and \-unfilled 
.Sq \&.Bd
displays types are synonyms, as are \-filled and \-ragged.
