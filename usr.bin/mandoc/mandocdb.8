.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Ar dir...
.Nm

.Fl d Ar dir

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility extracts keywords from
.Ux
manuals and indexes them in a
.Sx Keyword Database
and
.Sx Index Database
for fast retrieval.
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar dir
Remove
.Ar
from the databases in
.Ar dir .
.It Fl u Ar dir
Update (remove and re-add)
.Ar
from the databases in
.Ar dir .
.It Ar dir...
Recursively add files rooted at each
.Ar dir
to the databases in the respective
.Ar dir .
Existing databases are truncated.
.It Fl v
Verbose operation.
Use once to display all files added or removed and twice for keywords as
well.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
creates databases in each
.Ar dir
using files rooted in that directory.
.Pp
If fatal parse errors are encountered while parsing, the offending file
is printed to stderr, omitted from the index, and the parse continues
with the next input file.
.Ss Index Database
The index database,
.Pa mandoc.index ,
is a
.Xr recno 3
database with record values consisting of
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
a nil-terminated filename,
.It
a nil-terminated manual section,
.It
a nil-terminated manual title,
.It
a nil-terminated architecture
.Pq this is not often available
.It
and a nil-terminated description.
.El
.Pp
Both the manual section and description may be zero-length if the record
is unassigned.
Entries are sequentially-numbered, but the filenames are unordered.
.Ss Keyword Database
The keyword database,
.Pa mandoc.db ,
is a
.Xr btree 3
database of nil-terminated keywords (record length is non-zero string
length plus one) mapping to a 8-byte binary field consisting of the
keyword type and source
.Sx Index Database
record number.
The type, a 32-bit bit-mask in host order, consists of the following
fields:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Li 0x01
The name of a manual page as given in the NAME section.
.It Li 0x02
A function prototype name as given in the SYNOPSIS section.
.It Li 0x04
A utility name as given in the SYNOPSIS section.
.It Li 0x08
An include file as given in the SYNOPSIS section.
.It Li 0x10
A variable name as given in the SYNOPSIS section.
.It Li 0x20
A standard as given in the STANDARDS section.
.It Li 0x40
An author as given in the AUTHORS section.
.It Li 0x80
A configuration as given in the SYNOPSIS section.
.It Li 0x100
Free-form descriptive text as given in the NAME section.
.It Li 0x200
Cross-links between manuals.
Listed as the link name, then a period, then the link section.
If the link has no section, the period terminates the string.
.It Li 0x400
Path reference as given in the FILES section.
.It Li 0x800
Environment variable as given in the ENVIRONMENT section.
.It Li 0x1000
Error codes as given in the ERRORS section.
.El
.Pp
The last four bytes are a host-ordered record number within the
.Sx Index Database .

.Nm
utility is

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The time to construct a new database pair grows linearly with the
number of keywords in the input files.
However, removing or updating entries with
.Fl u
or
.Fl d ,
respectively, grows as a multiple of the index length and input size.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa mandoc.db
A
.Xr btree 3
keyword database mapping keywords to a type and file reference in
.Pa mandoc.index .
.It Pa mandoc.index
A
.Xr recno 3
database of indexed file-names.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It 0
No errors occurred.
.It 5
Invalid command line arguments were specified.
No input files have been read.
.It 6
An operating system error occurred, for example memory exhaustion or an
error accessing input files.
Such errors cause
.Nm
to exit at once, possibly in the middle of parsing or formatting a file.
The output databases are corrupt and should be removed .
