.Sh NAME
.Nm arch ,
.Nm machine
.Nd print architecture type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm arch
.Op Fl ks
.Nm machine
.Op Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm arch
and
.Nm machine
commands display the machine's architecture in slightly different ways.
.Nm arch
by default displays the application architecture, defined by both the
operating system and the instruction set architecture, while
.Nm machine
displays the kernel architecture (without the operating system part).
Note that both commands output the target architecture as opposed to
.Xr uname 1
which describes the host.
This is useful for dynamic discovery
of the target architecture in build or configuration scripts
needing to work in cross-compilation environments.
.Pp
The options for
.Nm arch
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl k
Display the kernel architecture instead of application
architecture.
.It Fl s
Display the chosen architecture in a short form, i.e., without the
operating system prefixed.
.El
.Pp
The options for
.Nm machine
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Display the application architecture instead of the kernel architecture.
