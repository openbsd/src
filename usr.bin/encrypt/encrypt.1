.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm encrypt
.Nd encrypt passwords from the command line or standard input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm encrypt
.Op Fl b Ar rounds
.Op Fl c Ar class
.Op Fl p | Ar string
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints the encrypted form of
.Ar string
to the standard output.
This is mostly useful for encrypting passwords from within scripts.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar rounds
Encrypt the string using Blowfish hashing with the specified number of
.Ar rounds .
May also specify 'a' to request a variable number of rounds scaled to the
machine's CPU capabilities.
.It Fl c Ar class
Use the cipher type specified in the given user login class.
See
.Xr login.conf 5
for more information.
.It Fl p
Prompt for a single string with echo turned off.
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar string
is specified,
.Nm
reads one string per line from standard input, encrypting each one.
In the case where no specific algorithm or specific user login class was given
as a command line option, the algorithm specified in the default class in
.Pa /etc/login.conf
will be used.
.Pp
For Blowfish, a new random salt is automatically generated for each
password.
.Pp
Specifying the
.Ar string
on the command line should be discouraged; using the
standard input is more secure.
