.Sh NAME
.Nm elf2olf ,
.Nm olf2elf
.Nd convert between ELF and OLF object module format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm elf2olf
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl o Ar opsys
.Ar module ...
.Nm olf2elf
.Op Fl v
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm elf2olf
utility reads the specified
.Em ELF
version 1 module operands and converts them to the default operating system's
.Em OLF
object module format.
.Pp
The
.Nm olf2elf
utility reverses the process.
The
.Ar module
operands are processed in command line order.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar opsys
Specifies the operating system
.Em OLF
tag
.Em "opsys"
as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact

.Pp
The
.Nm elf2olf
and
.Nm olf2elf
utilities exit 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm elf2olf
and
.Nm olf2elf
utilities first appeared in
.Ox 2.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS

.Sh BUGS
The
.Em ELF
version 1 object module format lacks any real method to determine the native
operating system for any given binary thus mandating the existence of these
tools.
The converted binaries created by
.Nm elf2olf
will no longer execute on their native operating system, only on OLF
enabled platforms, although
.Nm olf2elf
will undo the damage.
