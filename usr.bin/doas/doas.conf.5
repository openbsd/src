.Sh NAME
.Nm doas.conf
.Nd doas configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr doas 1
utility executes commands as other users according to the rules
in the
.Nm
configuration file.
.Pp
The rules have the following format:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Ic permit Ns | Ns Ic deny
.Op Ar options
.Ar identity
.Op Ic as Ar target
.Oo
.Ic cmd Ar command Op Ic args ...
.Oc
.Ed
.Pp
Rules consist of the following parts:
.Bl -tag -width 11n
.It Ic permit Ns | Ns Ic deny
The action to be taken if this rule matches.
.It Ar options
Options are:
.Bl -tag -width keepenv
.It Ic nopass
The user is not required to enter a password.
.It Ic keepenv
The user's environment is maintained.
The default is to reset the environment, except for the variables
.Ev DISPLAY ,
.Ev HOME ,
.Ev LOGNAME ,
.Ev MAIL ,
.Ev PATH ,
.Ev TERM ,
.Ev USER
and
.Ev USERNAME .
.It Ic keepenv { Oo variable names Oc Ic }
Reset the environment, but keep the space-separated specified variables.
.El
.It Ar identity
The username to match.
Groups may be specified by prepending a colon (:).
Numeric IDs are also accepted.
.It Ic as Ar target
The target user the running user is allowed to run the command as.
The default is root.
.It Ic cmd Ar command
The command the user is allowed or denied to run.
The default is all commands.
Be advised that it's best to specify absolute paths.
.It Ic args Op ...
Arguments to command.
If specified, the command arguments set provided by user and
the command arguments set in rule should be the same for successful
rule match.
Specifying
.Ic args
alone means that command should be run without any arguments.
.El
.Pp
The last matching rule determines the action taken.
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example permits users in group wsrc to build ports,
wheel to execute commands as root while keeping the environment
variables
.Ev ENV ,
.Ev PS1 ,
and
.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK ,
and additionally permits tedu to run procmap as root without a password.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Non-exhaustive list of variables needed to
# build release(8) and ports(7)
