.Sh NAME
.Nm doas.conf
.Nd doas configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/doas.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr doas 1
utility executes commands as other users according to the rules
in the
.Nm
configuration file.
.Pp
The rules have the following format:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Ic permit Ns | Ns Ic deny
.Op Ar options
.Ar identity
.Op Ic as Ar target
.Op Ic cmd Ar command Op Ic args ...
.Ed
.Pp
Rules consist of the following parts:
.Bl -tag -width 11n
.It Ic permit Ns | Ns Ic deny
The action to be taken if this rule matches.
.It Ar options
Options are:
.Bl -tag -width keepenv
.It Ic nopass
The user is not required to enter a password.
.It Ic keepenv
The user's environment is maintained.
The default is to reset the environment, except for the variables
.Ev DISPLAY ,
.Ev HOME ,
.Ev LOGNAME ,
.Ev MAIL ,
.Ev PATH ,
.Ev TERM ,
.Ev USER
and
.Ev USERNAME .
.It Ic keepenv { Oo Ar variable ... Oc Ic }
In addition to the variables mentioned above, keep the space-separated
specified variables.
.El
.It Ar identity
The username to match.
Groups may be specified by prepending a colon
.Pq Sq \&: .
Numeric IDs are also accepted.
.It Ic as Ar target
The target user the running user is allowed to run the command as.
The default is all users.
.It Ic cmd Ar command
The command the user is allowed or denied to run.
The default is all commands.
Be advised that it's best to specify absolute paths.
If a cmd is specified, only a restricted
.Ev PATH
will be searched.
.It Ic args ...
Arguments to command.
If specified, the command arguments provided by the user
need to match for the command to be successful.
Specifying
.Ic args
alone means that command should be run without any arguments.
.El
.Pp
The last matching rule determines the action taken.
.Pp
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
.Pp
The following quoting rules apply:
.Bl -dash
.It
The text between a pair of double quotes
.Pq Sq \&"
is taken as is.
.It
The backslash character
.Pq Sq \e
escapes the next character, including new line characters, outside comments;
as a result, comments may not be extended over multiple lines.
.It
If quotes or backslashes are used in a word,
it isn't considered a keyword.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example permits users in group wsrc to build ports,
wheel to execute commands as any user while keeping the environment
variables
.Ev ENV ,
.Ev PS1 ,
and
.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK ,
permits tedu to run procmap as root without a password,
and additionally permits root to run unrestricted commands as itself.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Non-exhaustive list of variables needed to
# build release(8) and ports(7)
permit nopass keepenv { \e
        FTPMODE PKG_CACHE PKG_PATH SM_PATH SSH_AUTH_SOCK \e
        DESTDIR DISTDIR FETCH_CMD FLAVOR GROUP MAKE MAKECONF \e
