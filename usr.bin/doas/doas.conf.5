.Sh NAME
.Nm doas.conf
.Nd doas configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr doas 1
utility executes commands as other users according to the rules
in the
.Nm
configuration file.
.Pp
The rules have the following format:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Ic permit Ns | Ns Ic deny
.Op Ar options
.Ar identity
.Op Ic as Ar target
.Op Ic cmd Ar command Op Ic args No ...
.Ed
.Pp
Rules consist of the following parts:
.Bl -tag -width 11n
.It Ic permit Ns | Ns Ic deny
The action to be taken if this rule matches.
.It Ar options
Options are:
.Bl -tag -width keepenv
.It Ic nopass
The user is not required to enter a password.
.It Ic persist
After the user successfully authenticates, do not ask for a password
again for some time.
.It Ic keepenv
The user's environment is maintained.
The default is to reset the environment, except for the variables
.Ev DISPLAY ,
.Ev HOME ,
.Ev LOGNAME ,
.Ev MAIL ,
.Ev PATH ,
.Ev TERM ,
.Ev USER
and
.Ev USERNAME .
.It Ic setenv { Oo Ar variable ... Oc Oo Ar variable=value ... Oc Ic }
In addition to the variables mentioned above, keep the space-separated
specified variables.
Variables may also be removed with a leading
.Sq -
or set using the latter syntax.
If the first character of
.Ar value
is a
.Ql $
then the value to be set is taken from the existing environment
variable of the indicated name.
.El
.It Ar identity
The username to match.
Groups may be specified by prepending a colon
.Pq Sq \&: .
Numeric IDs are also accepted.
.It Ic as Ar target
The target user the running user is allowed to run the command as.
The default is all users.
.It Ic cmd Ar command
The command the user is allowed or denied to run.
The default is all commands.
Be advised that it is best to specify absolute paths.
If a relative path is specified, only a restricted
.Ev PATH
will be searched.
.It Ic args Op Ar argument ...
Arguments to command.
The command arguments provided by the user need to match those specified.
The keyword
.Ic args
alone means that command must be run without any arguments.
.El
.Pp
The last matching rule determines the action taken.
If no rule matches, the action is denied.
.Pp
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
.Pp
The following quoting rules apply:
.Bl -dash
.It
The text between a pair of double quotes
.Pq Sq \&"
is taken as is.
.It
The backslash character
.Pq Sq \e
escapes the next character, including new line characters, outside comments;
as a result, comments may not be extended over multiple lines.
.It
If quotes or backslashes are used in a word,
it is not considered a keyword.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example permits user aja to install packages
from a preferred mirror;
group wheel to execute commands as any user while keeping the environment
variables
.Ev PS1
and
.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK
and
unsetting
.Ev ENV ;
permits tedu to run procmap as root without a password;
and additionally permits root to run unrestricted commands as itself.
