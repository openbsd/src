.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a small tool that performs throughput benchmarking and concurrent
sampling of kernel network variables.
.Pp
.Nm
is run as a client/server pair.
The server must be invoked with the
.Fl s
flag, which will cause it to listen for incoming connections.
The client must be invoked with the
.Ar hostname
of a listening server to connect to.
.Pp
Once connected, the client will send TCP or UDP traffic as fast as possible to
the server.
Both the client and server will periodically display throughput
statistics along with any kernel variables the user has selected to
sample (using the
.Fl k
option, which is only available in TCP mode).
A list of available kernel variables may be obtained using the
.Fl l
option.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl B Ar buf
Specify the size of the internal read/write buffer used by
.Nm .
The default is 262144 bytes for TCP client/server and UDP server.
In UDP client mode this may be used to specify the packet size on the test
stream.
.It Fl b Ar addr
Specifies the IP address of the interface which is used to send the packets.
.It Fl k Ar kvars
Specify one or more kernel variables to monitor; multiple variables must be
separated with commas.
This option is only valid in TCP mode.
The default is not to monitor any variables.
Using this option requires read access to
.Pa /dev/kmem ,
which may be restricted based upon the value of the
.Ar kern.allowkmem
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.It Fl l
List the name of kernel variables available for monitoring and exit.
.It Fl n Ar connections
Use the given number of TCP connections (default: 1).
UDP is connectionless so this option isn't valid.
.It Fl p Ar port
Specify the port used for the test stream (default: 12345).
.It Fl R
In client mode the write buffer size is randomized up to the size specified via
.Fl B .
.It Fl r Ar interval
Specify the statistics interval reporting rate in milliseconds (default: 1000).
.It Fl S Ar space
Set the size of the socket buffer used for the test stream.
On the client this option will resize the send buffer;
on the server it will resize the receive buffer.
.It Fl s
Place
.Nm
in server mode, where it will listen on all interfaces for incoming
connections.
It defaults to using TCP if
.Fl u
is not specified.
.It Fl T Ar toskeyword
Change the IPv4 TOS or IPv6 TCLASS value.
.Ar toskeyword
may be one of
.Ar critical ,
.Ar inetcontrol ,
.Ar lowdelay ,
.Ar netcontrol ,
.Ar throughput ,
.Ar reliability ,
or one of the DiffServ Code Points:
.Ar ef ,
.Ar af11 ... af43 ,
.Ar cs0 ... cs7 ;
or a number in either hex or decimal.
.It Fl t Ar secs
Stop after
.Ar secs
seconds.
.It Fl U
Use AF_UNIX sockets instead of IPv4 or IPv6 sockets.
In client and server mode
.Ar hostname
is used as the path to the AF_UNIX socket.
.It Fl u
Use UDP instead of TCP; this must be specified on both the client
and the server.
Transmitted packets per second (TX PPS) will be accounted on the client
side, while received packets per second (RX PPS) will be accounted on the
server side.
UDP has no Protocol Control Block (PCB) so the
.Fl k
flags don't apply.
.It Fl V Ar rtable
Set the routing table to be used.
.It Fl v
Display verbose output.
If specified more than once, increase the detail of information displayed.
