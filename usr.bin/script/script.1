.Dt SCRIPT 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm script
.Nd make typescript of terminal session
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm script
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl c Ar command
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.
It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive
session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file
can be printed out later with
.Xr lpr 1 .
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar file
is given,
.Nm
saves all dialogue in
.Ar file .
If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file
.Pa typescript .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Append the output to
.Ar file
or
.Pa typescript ,
retaining the prior contents.
.It Fl c Ar command
Run
.Nm sh Fl c Ar command ,
instead of an interactive shell.
To run a command with arguments, enclose both in quotes.
.El
.Pp
The script ends when the forked program exits (an
.Ic exit ,
.Ic logout ,
or control-D
.Pq Ql ^D
will exit most interactive shells).
.Nm
will exit with the status of 0 unless any of its child
processes fail, in which case,
.Nm
will return 1.
.Pp
Certain interactive commands, such as
.Xr vi 1 ,
create garbage in the typescript file.
.Nm
works best with commands that do not manipulate the
screen; the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width SHELL
.It Ev SHELL
Name of the shell to be forked by
.Nm script .
If not set, the Bourne shell is assumed.
(Most shells set this variable automatically.)
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Start a virtual machine and log all console output to a file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ script -c "vmctl start -c myvm" myvm.typescript
.Ed
.Sh HISTORY
A predecessor called
.Nm dribble
appeared in
.Bx 2 .
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Bx 3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Mary Ann Horton .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
places
.Em everything
in the log file, including linefeeds and backspaces.
This is not what the naive user expects.
