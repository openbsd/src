.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a terminal multiplexer:
it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and
controlled from a single screen.
.Nm
may be detached from a screen
and continue running in the background,
then later reattached.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is started it creates a new
.Em session
with a single
.Em window
and displays it on screen.
A status line at the bottom of the screen
shows information on the current session
and is used to enter interactive commands.
.Pp
A session is a single collection of
.Em pseudo terminals
under the management of
.Nm .
Each session has one or more
windows linked to it.
A window occupies the entire screen
and may be split into rectangular panes,
each of which is a separate pseudo terminal
(the
.Xr pty 4
manual page documents the technical details of pseudo terminals).
Any number of
.Nm
instances may connect to the same session,
and any number of windows may be present in the same session.
Once all sessions are killed,
.Nm
exits.
.Pp
Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection
(such as
.Xr ssh 1
connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the
.Ql C-b d
key strokes).
.Nm
may be reattached using:
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux attach
.Pp
In
.Nm ,
a session is displayed on screen by a
.Em client
and all sessions are managed by a single
.Em server .
The server and each client are separate processes which communicate through a
socket in
.Pa /tmp .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
.It Fl 2
Force
.Nm
to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.
This is equivalent to
.Fl T Ar 256 .
.It Fl C
Start in control mode (see the
.Sx CONTROL MODE
section).
Given twice
.Xo ( Fl CC ) Xc
disables echo.
.It Fl c Ar shell-command
Execute
.Ar shell-command
using the default shell.
If necessary, the
.Nm
server will be started to retrieve the
.Ic default-shell
option.
This option is for compatibility with
.Xr sh 1
when
.Nm
is used as a login shell.
.It Fl D
Do not start the
.Nm
server as a daemon.
This also turns the
.Ic exit-empty
option off.
With
.Fl D ,
.Ar command
may not be specified.
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
By default,
.Nm
loads the system configuration file from
.Pa /etc/tmux.conf ,
if present, then looks for a user configuration file at
.Pa ~/.tmux.conf .
.Pp
The configuration file is a set of
.Nm
commands which are executed in sequence when the server is first started.
.Nm
loads configuration files once when the server process has started.
The
.Ic source-file
command may be used to load a file later.
.Pp
.Nm
shows any error messages from commands in configuration files in the first
session created, and continues to process the rest of the configuration file.
.It Fl L Ar socket-name
.Nm
stores the server socket in a directory under
.Ev TMUX_TMPDIR
or
.Pa /tmp
if it is unset.
The default socket is named
.Em default .
This option allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several
independent
.Nm
servers to be run.
Unlike
.Fl S
a full path is not necessary: the sockets are all created in the same
directory.
.Pp
If the socket is accidentally removed, the
.Dv SIGUSR1
signal may be sent to the
.Nm
server process to recreate it (note that this will fail if any parent
directories are missing).
.It Fl l
Behave as a login shell.
This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells
when using tmux as a login shell.
.It Fl S Ar socket-path
Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.
If
.Fl S
is specified, the default socket directory is not used and any
.Fl L
flag is ignored.
.It Fl u
Write UTF-8 output to the terminal even if the first environment
variable of
.Ev LC_ALL ,
.Ev LC_CTYPE ,
or
.Ev LANG
that is set does not contain
.Qq UTF-8
or
.Qq UTF8 .
This is equivalent to
.Fl T Ar UTF-8 .
.It Fl T Ar features
Set terminal features for the client.
This is a comma-separated list of features.
See the
.Ic terminal-features
option.
.It Fl v
Request verbose logging.
Log messages will be saved into
.Pa tmux-client-PID.log
and
.Pa tmux-server-PID.log
files in the current directory, where
.Em PID
is the PID of the server or client process.
If
.Fl v
is specified twice, an additional
.Pa tmux-out-PID.log
file is generated with a copy of everything
.Nm
writes to the terminal.
.Pp
The
.Dv SIGUSR2
signal may be sent to the
.Nm
server process to toggle logging between on (as if
.Fl v
was given) and off.
.It Fl V
Report the
.Nm
version.
.It Ar command Op Ar flags
This specifies one of a set of commands used to control
.Nm ,
as described in the following sections.
If no commands are specified, the
.Ic new-session
command is assumed.
.El

.El
.Pp
Key bindings may be changed with the
.Ic bind-key
and
.Ic unbind-key
commands.
.Sh COMMAND PARSING AND EXECUTION
.Nm
supports a large number of commands which can be used to control its
behaviour.
Each command is named and can accept zero or more flags and arguments.
They may be bound to a key with the
.Ic bind-key
command or run from the shell prompt, a shell script, a configuration file or
the command prompt.
For example, the same
.Ic set-option
command run from the shell prompt, from
.Pa ~/.tmux.conf
and bound to a key may look like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

bind-key C set-option -g status-style bg=cyan
.Ed
.Pp
Here, the command name is
.Ql set-option ,
.Ql Fl g
is a flag and
.Ql status-style
and
.Ql bg=cyan
are arguments.
.Pp
.Nm
distinguishes between command parsing and execution.
In order to execute a command,
.Nm
needs it to be split up into its name and arguments.
This is command parsing.
If a command is run from the shell, the shell parses it; from inside
.Nm
or from a configuration file,
.Nm
does.
Examples of when
.Nm
parses commands are:
.Bl -dash -offset indent
.It
in a configuration file;
.It
typed at the command prompt (see
.Ic command-prompt ) ;
.It
given to
.Ic bind-key ;
.It
passed as arguments to
.Ic if-shell
or
.Ic confirm-before .
.El
.Pp
To execute commands, each client has a
.Ql command queue .
A global command queue not attached to any client is used on startup
for configuration files like
.Pa ~/.tmux.conf .
Parsed commands added to the queue are executed in order.
Some commands, like
.Ic if-shell
and
.Ic confirm-before ,
parse their argument to create a new command which is inserted immediately
after themselves.
This means that arguments can be parsed twice or more - once when the parent command (such as
.Ic if-shell )
is parsed and again when it parses and executes its command.
Commands like
.Ic if-shell ,
.Ic run-shell
and
.Ic display-panes
stop execution of subsequent commands on the queue until something happens -
.Ic if-shell
and
.Ic run-shell
until a shell command finishes and
.Ic display-panes
until a key is pressed.
For example, the following commands:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
new-session; new-window
if-shell "true" "split-window"
kill-session
.Ed
.Pp
Will execute
.Ic new-session ,
.Ic new-window ,
.Ic if-shell ,
the shell command
.Xr true 1 ,
.Ic split-window
and
.Ic kill-session
in that order.
.Pp
The
.Sx COMMANDS
section lists the
.Nm
commands and their arguments.
.Sh PARSING SYNTAX
This section describes the syntax of commands parsed by
.Nm ,
for example in a configuration file or at the command prompt.
Note that when commands are entered into the shell, they are parsed by the shell
- see for example
.Xr ksh 1
or
.Xr csh 1 .
.Pp
Each command is terminated by a newline or a semicolon (;).
Commands separated by semicolons together form a
.Ql command sequence
- if a command in the sequence encounters an error, no subsequent commands are
executed.
.Pp
Comments are marked by the unquoted # character - any remaining text after a
comment is ignored until the end of the line.
.Pp
If the last character of a line is \e, the line is joined with the following
line (the \e and the newline are completely removed).
This is called line continuation and applies both inside and outside quoted
strings and in comments, but not inside braces.
.Pp
Command arguments may be specified as strings surrounded by single (') quotes,
double quotes (") or braces ({}).
.\" "
This is required when the argument contains any special character.
Single and double quoted strings cannot span multiple lines except with line
continuation.
Braces can span multiple lines.
.Pp
Outside of quotes and inside double quotes, these replacements are performed:
.Bl -dash -offset indent
.It
Environment variables preceded by $ are replaced with their value from the
global environment (see the
.Sx GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT
section).
.It
A leading ~ or ~user is expanded to the home directory of the current or
specified user.
.It
\euXXXX or \euXXXXXXXX is replaced by the Unicode codepoint corresponding to
the given four or eight digit hexadecimal number.
.It
When preceded (escaped) by a \e, the following characters are replaced: \ee by
the escape character; \er by a carriage return; \en by a newline; and \et by a
tab.
.It
\eooo is replaced by a character of the octal value ooo.
Three octal digits are required, for example \e001.
The largest valid character is \e377.
.It
Any other characters preceded by \e are replaced by themselves (that is, the \e
is removed) and are not treated as having any special meaning - so for example
\e; will not mark a command sequence and \e$ will not expand an environment
variable.
.El
.Pp
Braces are parsed as a configuration file (so conditions such as
.Ql %if
are processed) and then converted into a string.
They are designed to avoid the need for additional escaping when passing a
group of
.Nm
commands as an argument (for example to
.Ic if-shell ) .
These two examples produce an identical command - note that no escaping is
needed when using {}:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if-shell true {
    display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }$foo'
}

if-shell true "display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }\e$foo'"
.Ed
.Pp
Braces may be enclosed inside braces, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind x if-shell "true" {
    if-shell "true" {
        display "true!"
    }
}
.Ed
.Pp
Environment variables may be set by using the syntax
.Ql name=value ,
for example
.Ql HOME=/home/user .
Variables set during parsing are added to the global environment.
A hidden variable may be set with
.Ql %hidden ,
for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
%hidden MYVAR=42
.Ed
.Pp
Hidden variables are not passed to the environment of processes created
by tmux.
See the
.Sx GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT
section.
.Pp
Commands may be parsed conditionally by surrounding them with
.Ql %if ,
.Ql %elif ,
.Ql %else
and
.Ql %endif .
The argument to
.Ql %if
and
.Ql %elif
is expanded as a format (see
.Sx FORMATS )
and if it evaluates to false (zero or empty), subsequent text is ignored until
the closing
.Ql %elif ,
.Ql %else
or
.Ql %endif .
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
%if "#{==:#{host},myhost}"
set -g status-style bg=red
%elif "#{==:#{host},myotherhost}"
set -g status-style bg=green
%else
set -g status-style bg=blue
%endif
.Ed
.Pp
Will change the status line to red if running on
.Ql myhost ,
green if running on
.Ql myotherhost ,
or blue if running on another host.
Conditionals may be given on one line, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
%if #{==:#{host},myhost} set -g status-style bg=red %endif
.Ed
.Sh COMMANDS
This section describes the commands supported by
.Nm .
Most commands accept the optional
.Fl t
(and sometimes
.Fl s )
argument with one of
.Ar target-client ,
.Ar target-session ,
.Ar target-window ,
or
.Ar target-pane .
These specify the client, session, window or pane which a command should affect.
.Pp
.Ar target-client
should be the name of the client,
typically the
.Xr pty 4
file to which the client is connected, for example either of
.Pa /dev/ttyp1
or
.Pa ttyp1
for the client attached to
.Pa /dev/ttyp1 .
If no client is specified,
.Nm
attempts to work out the client currently in use; if that fails, an error is
reported.
Clients may be listed with the
.Ic list-clients
command.
.Pp
.Ar target-session
is tried as, in order:
.Bl -enum -offset Ds
.It
A session ID prefixed with a $.
.It
An exact name of a session (as listed by the
.Ic list-sessions
command).
.It
The start of a session name, for example
.Ql mysess
would match a session named
.Ql mysession .
.It
An
.Xr fnmatch 3
pattern which is matched against the session name.
.El
.Pp
If the session name is prefixed with an
.Ql = ,
only an exact match is accepted (so
.Ql =mysess
will only match exactly
.Ql mysess ,
not
.Ql mysession ) .
.Pp
If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches
produce an error.
If a session is omitted, the current session is used if available; if no
current session is available, the most recently used is chosen.
.Pp
.Ar target-window
(or
.Ar src-window
or
.Ar dst-window )
specifies a window in the form
.Em session Ns \&: Ns Em window .
.Em session
follows the same rules as for
.Ar target-session ,
and
.Em window
is looked for in order as:
.Bl -enum -offset Ds
.It
A special token, listed below.
.It
A window index, for example
.Ql mysession:1
is window 1 in session
.Ql mysession .
.It
A window ID, such as @1.
.It
An exact window name, such as
.Ql mysession:mywindow .
.It
The start of a window name, such as
.Ql mysession:mywin .
.It
As an
.Xr fnmatch 3
pattern matched against the window name.
.El
.Pp
Like sessions, a
.Ql =
prefix will do an exact match only.
An empty window name specifies the next unused index if appropriate (for
example the
.Ic new-window
and
.Ic link-window
commands)
otherwise the current window in
.Em session
is chosen.
.Pp
The following special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.
Each has a single-character alternative form.
.Bl -column "XXXXXXXXXX" "X"
.It Sy "Token" Ta Sy "" Ta Sy "Meaning"
.It Li "{start}" Ta "^" Ta "The lowest-numbered window"
.It Li "{end}" Ta "$" Ta "The highest-numbered window"
.It Li "{last}" Ta "!" Ta "The last (previously current) window"
.It Li "{next}" Ta "+" Ta "The next window by number"
.It Li "{previous}" Ta "-" Ta "The previous window by number"
.El
.Pp
.Ar target-pane
(or
.Ar src-pane
or
.Ar dst-pane )
may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to
.Ar target-window
but with the optional addition of a period followed by a pane index or pane ID,
for example:
.Ql mysession:mywindow.1 .
If the pane index is omitted, the currently active pane in the specified
window is used.
The following special tokens are available for the pane index:
.Bl -column "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX" "X"
.It Sy "Token" Ta Sy "" Ta Sy "Meaning"
.It Li "{last}" Ta "!" Ta "The last (previously active) pane"
.It Li "{next}" Ta "+" Ta "The next pane by number"
.It Li "{previous}" Ta "-" Ta "The previous pane by number"
.It Li "{top}" Ta "" Ta "The top pane"
.It Li "{bottom}" Ta "" Ta "The bottom pane"
.It Li "{left}" Ta "" Ta "The leftmost pane"
.It Li "{right}" Ta "" Ta "The rightmost pane"
.It Li "{top-left}" Ta "" Ta "The top-left pane"
.It Li "{top-right}" Ta "" Ta "The top-right pane"
.It Li "{bottom-left}" Ta "" Ta "The bottom-left pane"
.It Li "{bottom-right}" Ta "" Ta "The bottom-right pane"
.It Li "{up-of}" Ta "" Ta "The pane above the active pane"
.It Li "{down-of}" Ta "" Ta "The pane below the active pane"
.It Li "{left-of}" Ta "" Ta "The pane to the left of the active pane"
.It Li "{right-of}" Ta "" Ta "The pane to the right of the active pane"
.El
.Pp
The tokens
.Ql +
and
.Ql -
may be followed by an offset, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
select-window -t:+2
.Ed
.Pp
In addition,
.Em target-session ,
.Em target-window
or
.Em target-pane
may consist entirely of the token
.Ql {mouse}
(alternative form
.Ql = )
to specify the session, window or pane where the most recent mouse event occurred
(see the
.Sx MOUSE SUPPORT
section)
or
.Ql {marked}
(alternative form
.Ql ~ )
to specify the marked pane (see
.Ic select-pane
.Fl m ) .
.Pp
Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are
prefixed with a
.Ql $ ,
windows with a
.Ql @ ,
and panes with a
.Ql % .
These are unique and are unchanged for the life of the session, window or pane
in the
.Nm
server.
The pane ID is passed to the child process of the pane in the
.Ev TMUX_PANE
environment variable.
IDs may be displayed using the
.Ql session_id ,
.Ql window_id ,
or
.Ql pane_id
formats (see the
.Sx FORMATS
section) and the
.Ic display-message ,
.Ic list-sessions ,
.Ic list-windows
or
.Ic list-panes
commands.
.Pp
.Ar shell-command
arguments are
.Xr sh 1
commands.
This may be a single argument passed to the shell, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
new-window 'vi /etc/passwd'
.Ed
.Pp
Will run:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/bin/sh -c 'vi /etc/passwd'
.Ed
.Pp
Additionally, the
.Ic new-window ,
.Ic new-session ,
.Ic split-window ,
.Ic respawn-window
and
.Ic respawn-pane
commands allow
.Ar shell-command
to be given as multiple arguments and executed directly (without
.Ql sh -c ) .
This can avoid issues with shell quoting.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux new-window vi /etc/passwd
.Ed
.Pp
Will run
.Xr vi 1
directly without invoking the shell.
.Pp
.Ar command
.Op Ar arguments
refers to a
.Nm
command, either passed with the command and arguments separately, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key F1 set-option status off
.Ed
.Pp
Or passed as a single string argument in
.Pa .tmux.conf ,
for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key F1 { set-option status off }
.Ed
.Pp
Example
.Nm
commands include:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

rename-session -tfirst newname

set-option -wt:0 monitor-activity on

new-window ; split-window -d

bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \e; \e
	display-message "source-file done"
.Ed
.Pp
Or from
.Xr sh 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux kill-window -t :1

$ tmux new-window \e; split-window -d

$ tmux new-session -d 'vi /etc/passwd' \e; split-window -d \e; attach
.Ed
.Sh CLIENTS AND SESSIONS
The
.Nm
server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.
Clients are attached to sessions to interact with them, either
when they are created with the
.Ic new-session
command, or later with the
.Ic attach-session
command.
Each session has one or more windows
.Em linked
into it.
Windows may be linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or
more panes,
each of which contains a pseudo terminal.
Commands for creating, linking and otherwise manipulating windows
are covered
in the
.Sx WINDOWS AND PANES
section.
.Pp
The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic attach-session
.Op Fl dErx
.Op Fl c Ar working-directory
.Op Fl f Ar flags
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic attach )
If run from outside
.Nm ,
create a new client in the current terminal and attach it to
.Ar target-session .
If used from inside, switch the current client.
If
.Fl d
is specified, any other clients attached to the session are detached.
If
.Fl x
is given, send
.Dv SIGHUP
to the parent process of the client as well as
detaching the client, typically causing it to exit.
.Fl f
sets a comma-separated list of client flags.
The flags are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It read-only
the client is read-only
.It ignore-size
the client does not affect the size of other clients
.It no-output
the client does not receive pane output in control mode
.It active-pane
the client has an independent active pane
.El
.Pp
A leading
.Ql !
turns a flag off if the client is already attached.
.Fl r
is an alias for
.Fl f
.Ar read-only,ignore-size .
When a client is read-only, only keys bound to the
.Ic detach-client
or
.Ic switch-client
commands have any effect.
A client with the
.Ar active-pane
flag allows the active pane to be selected independently of the window's active
pane used by clients without the flag.
This only affects the cursor position and commands issued from the client;
other features such as hooks and styles continue to use the window's active
pane.
.Pp
If no server is started,
.Ic attach-session
will attempt to start it; this will fail unless sessions are created in the
configuration file.
.Pp
The
.Ar target-session
rules for
.Ic attach-session
are slightly adjusted: if
.Nm
needs to select the most recently used session, it will prefer the most
recently used
.Em unattached
session.
.Pp
.Fl c
will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to
.Ar working-directory .
.Pp
If
.Fl E
is used, the
.Ic update-environment
option will not be applied.
.It Xo Ic detach-client
.Op Fl aP
.Op Fl E Ar shell-command
.Op Fl s Ar target-session
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic detach )
Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with
.Fl t ,
or all clients currently attached to the session specified by
.Fl s .
The
.Fl a
option kills all but the client given with
.Fl t .
If
.Fl P
is given, send
.Dv SIGHUP
to the parent process of the client, typically causing it
to exit.
With
.Fl E ,
run
.Ar shell-command
to replace the client.
.It Ic has-session Op Fl t Ar target-session
.D1 (alias: Ic has )
Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.
If it does exist, exit with 0.
.It Ic kill-server
Kill the
.Nm
server and clients and destroy all sessions.
.It Xo Ic kill-session
.Op Fl aC
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Xc
Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other
sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.
If
.Fl a
is given, all sessions but the specified one is killed.
The
.Fl C
flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or silence) in all windows linked to the
session.
.It Xo Ic list-clients
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic lsc )
List all clients attached to the server.
For the meaning of the
.Fl F
flag, see the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
If
.Ar target-session
is specified, list only clients connected to that session.
.It Xo Ic list-commands
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Ar command
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic lscm )
List the syntax of
.Ar command
or - if omitted - of all commands supported by
.Nm .
.It Xo Ic list-sessions
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl f Ar filter
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic ls )
List all sessions managed by the server.
.Fl F
specifies the format of each line and
.Fl f
a filter.
Only sessions for which the filter is true are shown.
See the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
.It Ic lock-client Op Fl t Ar target-client
.D1 (alias: Ic lockc )
Lock
.Ar target-client ,
see the
.Ic lock-server
command.
.It Ic lock-session Op Fl t Ar target-session
.D1 (alias: Ic locks )
Lock all clients attached to
.Ar target-session .
.It Xo Ic new-session
.Op Fl AdDEPX
.Op Fl c Ar start-directory
.Op Fl e Ar environment
.Op Fl f Ar flags
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl n Ar window-name
.Op Fl s Ar session-name
.Op Fl t Ar group-name
.Op Fl x Ar width
.Op Fl y Ar height
.Op Ar shell-command
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic new )
Create a new session with name
.Ar session-name .
.Pp
The new session is attached to the current terminal unless
.Fl d
is given.
.Ar window-name
and
.Ar shell-command
are the name of and shell command to execute in the initial window.
With
.Fl d ,
the initial size comes from the global
.Ic default-size
option;
.Fl x
and
.Fl y
can be used to specify a different size.
.Ql -
uses the size of the current client if any.
If
.Fl x
or
.Fl y
is given, the
.Ic default-size
option is set for the session.
.Fl f
sets a comma-separated list of client flags (see
.Ic attach-session ) .
.Pp
If run from a terminal, any
.Xr termios 4
special characters are saved and used for new windows in the new session.
.Pp
The
.Fl A
flag makes
.Ic new-session
behave like
.Ic attach-session
if
.Ar session-name
already exists; in this case,
.Fl D
behaves like
.Fl d
to
.Ic attach-session ,
and
.Fl X
behaves like
.Fl x
to
.Ic attach-session .
.Pp
If
.Fl t
is given, it specifies a
.Ic session group .
Sessions in the same group share the same set of windows - new windows are
linked to all sessions in the group and any windows closed removed from all
sessions.
The current and previous window and any session options remain independent and
any session in a group may be killed without affecting the others.
The
.Ar group-name
argument may be:
.Bl -enum -width Ds
.It
the name of an existing group, in which case the new session is added to that
group;
.It
the name of an existing session - the new session is added to the same group
as that session, creating a new group if necessary;
.It
the name for a new group containing only the new session.
.El
.Pp
.Fl n
and
.Ar shell-command
are invalid if
.Fl t
is used.
.Pp
The
.Fl P
option prints information about the new session after it has been created.
By default, it uses the format
.Ql #{session_name}:\&
but a different format may be specified with
.Fl F .
.Pp
If
.Fl E
is used, the
.Ic update-environment
option will not be applied.
.Fl e
takes the form
.Ql VARIABLE=value
and sets an environment variable for the newly created session; it may be
specified multiple times.
.It Xo Ic refresh-client
.Op Fl cDlLRSU
.Op Fl A Ar pane:state
.Op Fl C Ar XxY
.Op Fl f Ar flags
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Op Ar adjustment
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic refresh )
Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is given
with
.Fl t .
If
.Fl S
is specified, only update the client's status line.
.Pp
The
.Fl U ,
.Fl D ,
.Fl L
.Fl R ,
and
.Fl c
flags allow the visible portion of a window which is larger than the client
to be changed.
.Fl U
moves the visible part up by
.Ar adjustment
rows and
.Fl D
down,
.Fl L
left by
.Ar adjustment
columns and
.Fl R
right.
.Fl c
returns to tracking the cursor automatically.
If
.Ar adjustment
is omitted, 1 is used.
Note that the visible position is a property of the client not of the
window, changing the current window in the attached session will reset
it.
.Pp
.Fl C
sets the width and height of a control mode client.
.Fl A
informs
.Nm
of a control mode client's interest in a pane.
The argument is a pane ID (with leading
.Ql % ) ,
a colon, then one of
.Ql on
or
.Ql off .
If
.Ql off ,
.Nm
will not send output from the pane to the client and if all clients have turned
the pane off, will stop reading from the pane.
.Fl A
may be given multiple times.
.Pp
.Fl f
sets a comma-separated list of client flags, see
.Ic attach-session .
.Pp
.Fl l
requests the clipboard from the client using the
.Xr xterm 1
escape sequence and stores it in a new paste buffer.
.Pp
.Fl L ,
.Fl R ,
.Fl U
and
.Fl D
move the visible portion of the window left, right, up or down
by
.Ar adjustment ,
if the window is larger than the client.
.Fl c
resets so that the position follows the cursor.
See the
.Ic window-size
option.
.It Xo Ic rename-session
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Ar new-name
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic rename )
Rename the session to
.Ar new-name .
.It Xo Ic show-messages
.Op Fl JT
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic showmsgs )
Show server messages or information.
Messages are stored, up to a maximum of the limit set by the
.Ar message-limit
server option.
.Fl J
and
.Fl T
show debugging information about jobs and terminals.
.It Xo Ic source-file
.Op Fl nqv
.Ar path
.Ar ...
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic source )
Execute commands from one or more files specified by
.Ar path
(which may be
.Xr glob 7
patterns).
If
.Fl q
is given, no error will be returned if
.Ar path
does not exist.
With
.Fl n ,
the file is parsed but no commands are executed.
.Fl v
shows the parsed commands and line numbers if possible.
.It Ic start-server
.D1 (alias: Ic start )
Start the
.Nm
server, if not already running, without creating any sessions.
.Pp
Note that as by default the
.Nm
server will exit with no sessions, this is only useful if a session is created in
.Pa ~/.tmux.conf ,
.Ic exit-empty
is turned off, or another command is run as part of the same command sequence.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux start \\; show -g
.Ed
.It Xo Ic suspend-client
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic suspendc )
Suspend a client by sending
.Dv SIGTSTP
(tty stop).
.It Xo Ic switch-client
.Op Fl ElnprZ
.Op Fl c Ar target-client
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Op Fl T Ar key-table
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic switchc )
Switch the current session for client
.Ar target-client
to
.Ar target-session .
As a special case,
.Fl t
may refer to a pane (a target that contains
.Ql \&: ,
.Ql \&.
or
.Ql % ) ,
to change session, window and pane.
In that case,
.Fl Z
keeps the window zoomed if it was zoomed.
If
.Fl l ,
.Fl n
or
.Fl p
is used, the client is moved to the last, next or previous session
respectively.
.Fl r
toggles the client
.Ic read-only
and
.Ic ignore-size
flags (see the
.Ic attach-session
command).
.Pp
If
.Fl E
is used,
.Ic update-environment
option will not be applied.
.Pp
.Fl T
sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be interpreted
from
.Ar key-table .
This may be used to configure multiple prefix keys, or to bind commands to
sequences of keys.
For example, to make typing
.Ql abc
run the
.Ic list-keys
command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1
.Ed
.El
.Sh WINDOWS AND PANES
Each window displayed by
.Nm
may be split into one or more
.Em panes ;
each pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.
A window may be split into panes using the
.Ic split-window
command.
Windows may be split horizontally (with the
.Fl h
flag) or vertically.
Panes may be resized with the
.Ic resize-pane
command (bound to
.Ql C-Up ,
.Ql C-Down
.Ql C-Left
and
.Ql C-Right
by default), the current pane may be changed with the
.Ic select-pane
command and the
.Ic rotate-window
and
.Ic swap-pane
commands may be used to swap panes without changing their position.
Panes are numbered beginning from zero in the order they are created.
.Pp
By default, a
.Nm
pane permits direct access to the terminal contained in the pane.
A pane may also be put into one of several modes:
.Bl -dash -offset indent
.It
Copy mode, which permits a section of a window or its
history to be copied to a
.Em paste buffer
for later insertion into another window.
This mode is entered with the
.Ic copy-mode
command, bound to
.Ql \&[
by default.
Copied text can be pasted with the
.Ic paste-buffer
command, bound to
.Ql \&] .
.It
View mode, which is like copy mode but is entered when a command that produces
output, such as
.Ic list-keys ,
is executed from a key binding.
.It
Choose mode, which allows an item to be chosen from a list.
This may be a client, a session or window or pane, or a buffer.
This mode is entered with the
.Ic choose-buffer ,
.Ic choose-client
and
.Ic choose-tree
commands.
.El
.Pp
In copy mode an indicator is displayed in the top-right corner of the pane with
the current position and the number of lines in the history.
.Pp
Commands are sent to copy mode using the
.Fl X
flag to the
.Ic send-keys
command.
When a key is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one of two key tables,
depending on the
.Ic mode-keys
option:
.Ic copy-mode
for emacs, or
.Ic copy-mode-vi
for vi.
Key tables may be viewed with the
.Ic list-keys
command.
.Pp
The following commands are supported in copy mode:
.Bl -column "CommandXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" "viXXXXXXXXXX" "emacs" -offset indent
.It Sy "Command" Ta Sy "vi" Ta Sy "emacs"
.It Li "append-selection" Ta "" Ta ""

.It Li "top-line" Ta "H" Ta "M-R"
.El
.Pp
The search commands come in several varieties:
.Ql search-forward
and
.Ql search-backward
search for a regular expression;
the
.Ql -text
variants search for a plain text string rather than a regular expression;
.Ql -incremental
perform an incremental search and expect to be used with the
.Fl i
flag to the
.Ic command-prompt
command.
.Ql search-again
repeats the last search and
.Ql search-reverse
does the same but reverses the direction (forward becomes backward and backward
becomes forward).
.Pp
Copy commands may take an optional buffer prefix argument which is used
to generate the buffer name (the default is
.Ql buffer
so buffers are named
.Ql buffer0 ,
.Ql buffer1
and so on).
Pipe commands take a command argument which is the command to which the
copied text is piped.
The
.Ql -and-cancel
variants of some commands exit copy mode after they have completed (for copy
commands) or when the cursor reaches the bottom (for scrolling commands).
.Ql -no-clear
variants do not clear the selection.
.Pp
The next and previous word keys use space and the
.Ql - ,
.Ql _
and
.Ql @
characters as word delimiters by default, but this can be adjusted by
setting the
.Em word-separators
session option.
Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the
next word and previous word to the start of the previous word.
The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone as
the word separator.
.Pp
The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.
For instance, typing
.Ql f
followed by
.Ql /
will move the cursor to the next
.Ql /
character on the current line.
A
.Ql \&;
will then jump to the next occurrence.
.Pp
Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.
With vi key bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with
emacs, the Alt (meta) key and a number begins prefix entry.
.Pp
The synopsis for the
.Ic copy-mode
command is:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic copy-mode
.Op Fl eHMqu
.Op Fl s Ar src-pane
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Xc
Enter copy mode.
The
.Fl u
option scrolls one page up.
.Fl M
begins a mouse drag (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
.Sx MOUSE SUPPORT ) .
.Fl H
hides the position indicator in the top right.
.Fl q
cancels copy mode and any other modes.
.Fl s
copies from
.Ar src-pane
instead of
.Ar target-pane .
.Pp
.Fl e
specifies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen)
should exit copy mode.
While in copy mode, pressing a key other than those used for scrolling will
disable this behaviour.
This is intended to allow fast scrolling through a pane's history, for
example with:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind PageUp copy-mode -eu
.Ed
.El
.Pp
A number of preset arrangements of panes are available, these are called layouts.
These may be selected with the
.Ic select-layout
command or cycled with
.Ic next-layout
(bound to
.Ql Space
by default); once a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized
as normal.
.Pp
The following layouts are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic even-horizontal
Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.
.It Ic even-vertical
Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.
.It Ic main-horizontal
A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes
are spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.
Use the
.Em main-pane-height
window option to specify the height of the top pane.
.It Ic main-vertical
Similar to
.Ic main-horizontal
but the large pane is placed on the left and the others spread from top to
bottom along the right.
See the
.Em main-pane-width
window option.
.It Ic tiled
Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and
columns.
.El
.Pp
In addition,
.Ic select-layout
may be used to apply a previously used layout - the
.Ic list-windows
command displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for use with
.Ic select-layout .
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux list-windows
0: ksh [159x48]
    layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
$ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.
Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than that
from which the layout was originally defined.
.Pp
Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic break-pane
.Op Fl adP
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl n Ar window-name
.Op Fl s Ar src-pane
.Op Fl t Ar dst-window
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic breakp )
Break
.Ar src-pane
off from its containing window to make it the only pane in
.Ar dst-window .
With
.Fl a ,
the window is moved to the next index up (following windows
are moved if necessary).
If
.Fl d
is given, the new window does not become the current window.
The
.Fl P
option prints information about the new window after it has been created.
By default, it uses the format
.Ql #{session_name}:#{window_index}
but a different format may be specified with
.Fl F .
.It Xo Ic capture-pane
.Op Fl aepPqCJN
.Op Fl b Ar buffer-name
.Op Fl E Ar end-line
.Op Fl S Ar start-line
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic capturep )
Capture the contents of a pane.
If
.Fl p
is given, the output goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with
.Fl b
or a new buffer if omitted.
If
.Fl a
is given, the alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible.
If no alternate screen exists, an error will be returned unless
.Fl q
is given.
If
.Fl e
is given, the output includes escape sequences for text and background
attributes.
.Fl C
also escapes non-printable characters as octal \exxx.
.Fl N
preserves trailing spaces at each line's end and
.Fl J
preserves trailing spaces and joins any wrapped lines.
.Fl P
captures only any output that the pane has received that is the beginning of an
as-yet incomplete escape sequence.
.Pp
.Fl S
and
.Fl E
specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the
visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.
.Ql -
to
.Fl S
is the start of the history and to
.Fl E
the end of the visible pane.
The default is to capture only the visible contents of the pane.
.It Xo
.Ic choose-client
.Op Fl NrZ
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl f Ar filter
.Op Fl O Ar sort-order
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Op Ar template
.Xc
Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from
a list.
.Fl Z
zooms the pane.
The following keys may be used in client mode:
.Bl -column "Key" "Function" -offset indent
.It Sy "Key" Ta Sy "Function"
.It Li "Enter" Ta "Choose selected client"
.It Li "Up" Ta "Select previous client"
.It Li "Down" Ta "Select next client"
.It Li "C-s" Ta "Search by name"
.It Li "n" Ta "Repeat last search"
.It Li "t" Ta "Toggle if client is tagged"

.It Li "O" Ta "Change sort field"
.It Li "r" Ta "Reverse sort order"
.It Li "v" Ta "Toggle preview"
.It Li "q" Ta "Exit mode"
.El
.Pp
After a client is chosen,
.Ql %%
is replaced by the client name in
.Ar template
and the result executed as a command.
If
.Ar template
is not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is used.
.Pp
.Fl O
specifies the initial sort field: one of
.Ql name ,
.Ql size ,
.Ql creation ,
or
.Ql activity .
.Fl r
reverses the sort order.
.Fl f
specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero,
the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.
If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.
.Fl F
specifies the format for each item in the list.
.Fl N
starts without the preview.
This command works only if at least one client is attached.
.It Xo
.Ic choose-tree
.Op Fl GNrswZ
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl f Ar filter
.Op Fl O Ar sort-order
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Op Ar template
.Xc
Put a pane into tree mode, where a session, window or pane may be chosen
interactively from a list.
.Fl s
starts with sessions collapsed and
.Fl w
with windows collapsed.
.Fl Z
zooms the pane.
The following keys may be used in tree mode:
.Bl -column "Key" "Function" -offset indent
.It Sy "Key" Ta Sy "Function"
.It Li "Enter" Ta "Choose selected item"

A duration of zero means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.
While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be chosen with the
.Ql 0
to
.Ql 9
keys, which will cause
.Ar template
to be executed as a command with
.Ql %%

into the space.
This can be used to reverse
.Ic break-pane .
The
.Fl b
option causes
.Ar src-pane
to be joined to left of or above
.Ar dst-pane .
.Pp
If
.Fl s

Create a new window.
With
.Fl a ,
the new window is inserted at the next index up from the specified
.Ar target-window ,
moving windows up if necessary,
otherwise
.Ar target-window
is the new window location.
.Pp
If
.Fl d
is given, the session does not make the new window the current window.
.Ar target-window
represents the window to be created; if the target already exists an error is
shown, unless the
.Fl k
flag is used, in which case it is destroyed.
.Ar shell-command
is the command to execute.
If
.Ar shell-command
is not specified, the value of the
.Ic default-command
option is used.
.Fl c
specifies the working directory in which the new window is created.
.Pp
When the shell command completes, the window closes.
See the
.Ic remain-on-exit
option to change this behaviour.
.Pp
.Fl e
takes the form
.Ql VARIABLE=value
and sets an environment variable for the newly created window; it may be
specified multiple times.
.Pp
The
.Ev TERM
environment variable must be set to
.Ql screen
or
.Ql tmux
for all programs running
.Em inside
.Nm .
New windows will automatically have
.Ql TERM=screen
added to their environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in shell
start-up files or by the
.Fl e
option.
.Pp
The
.Fl P
option prints information about the new window after it has been created.
By default, it uses the format
.Ql #{session_name}:#{window_index}
but a different format may be specified with
.Fl F .

to a shell command or vice versa.
A pane may only be connected to one command at a time, any existing pipe is
closed before
.Ar shell-command
is executed.
The
.Ar shell-command
string may contain the special character sequences supported by the
.Ic status-left
option.
If no
.Ar shell-command
is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.
.Pp
.Fl I
and
.Fl O
specify which of the
.Ar shell-command
output streams are connected to the pane:
with
.Fl I
stdout is connected (so anything
.Ar shell-command
prints is written to the pane as if it were typed);
with
.Fl O
stdin is connected (so any output in the pane is piped to
.Ar shell-command ) .
Both may be used together and if neither are specified,
.Fl O
is used.
.Pp
The
.Fl o
option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe to
be toggled with a single key, for example:

.D1 (alias: Ic splitw )
Create a new pane by splitting
.Ar target-pane :
.Fl h
does a horizontal split and
.Fl v
a vertical split; if neither is specified,
.Fl v
is assumed.
The
.Fl l
option specifies the size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in
columns (for horizontal split);
.Ar size
may be followed by
.Ql %
to specify a percentage of the available space.
The

instead of splitting the active pane.
.Pp
An empty
.Ar shell-command
('') will create a pane with no command running in it.
Output can be sent to such a pane with the
.Ic display-message
command.
The
.Fl I
flag (if
.Ar shell-command
is not specified or empty)
will create an empty pane and forward any output from stdin to it.
For example:

except the source and destination windows are swapped.
It is an error if no window exists at
.Ar src-window .
If
.Fl d
is given, the new window does not become the current window.
.Pp
If
.Fl s
is omitted and a marked pane is present (see
.Ic select-pane
.Fl m ) ,
the window containing the marked pane is used rather than the current window.
.It Xo Ic unlink-window

.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic unlinkw )
Unlink
.Ar target-window .
Unless
.Fl k
is given, a window may be unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions -
windows may not be linked to no sessions;
if
.Fl k
is specified and the window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and
destroyed.
.El
.Sh KEY BINDINGS
.Nm
allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key.
When specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example
.Ql A
to
.Ql Z ) .
Ctrl keys may be prefixed with
.Ql C-
or
.Ql ^ ,
and Alt (meta) with
.Ql M- .
In addition, the following special key names are accepted:
.Em Up ,
.Em Down ,
.Em Left ,
.Em Right ,
.Em BSpace ,
.Em BTab ,
.Em DC
(Delete),
.Em End ,
.Em Enter ,
.Em Escape ,
.Em F1
to
.Em F12 ,
.Em Home ,
.Em IC
(Insert),
.Em NPage/PageDown/PgDn ,
.Em PPage/PageUp/PgUp ,
.Em Space ,
and
.Em Tab .
Note that to bind the
.Ql \&"
or
.Ql '
keys, quotation marks are necessary, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key '"' split-window
bind-key "'" new-window
.Ed
.Pp
A command bound to the
.Em Any
key will execute for all keys which do not have a more specific binding.
.Pp
Commands related to key bindings are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic bind-key
.Op Fl nr
.Op Fl N Ar note
.Op Fl T Ar key-table
.Ar key command Op Ar arguments
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic bind )
Bind key
.Ar key
to
.Ar command .
Keys are bound in a key table.
By default (without -T), the key is bound in
the
.Em prefix
key table.
This table is used for keys pressed after the prefix key (for example,
by default
.Ql c
is bound to
.Ic new-window
in the
.Em prefix
table, so
.Ql C-b c
creates a new window).
The
.Em root
table is used for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding
.Ql c
to
.Ic new-window
in the
.Em root
table (not recommended) means a plain
.Ql c
will create a new window.
.Fl n
is an alias
for
.Fl T Ar root .
Keys may also be bound in custom key tables and the
.Ic switch-client
.Fl T
command used to switch to them from a key binding.
The
.Fl r
flag indicates this key may repeat, see the
.Ic repeat-time
option.
.Fl N
attaches a note to the key (shown with
.Ic list-keys
.Fl N ) .
.Pp
To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the
.Ic list-keys
command.
.It Xo Ic list-keys
.Op Fl 1aN
.Op Fl P Ar prefix-string Fl T Ar key-table
.Op Ar key
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic lsk )
List key bindings.
There are two forms: the default lists keys as
.Ic bind-key
commands;
.Fl N
lists only keys with attached notes and shows only the key and note for each
key.
.Pp
With the default form, all key tables are listed by default.
.Fl T
lists only keys in
.Ar key-table .
.Pp
With the
.Fl N
form, only keys in the
.Em root
and
.Em prefix
key tables are listed by default;
.Fl T
also lists only keys in
.Ar key-table .
.Fl P
specifies a prefix to print before each key and
.Fl 1
lists only the first matching key.
.Fl a
lists the command for keys that do have a note rather than skipping them.
.It Xo Ic send-keys
.Op Fl FHlMRX
.Op Fl N Ar repeat-count
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Ar key Ar ...
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic send )
Send a key or keys to a window.
Each argument
.Ar key
is the name of the key (such as
.Ql C-a
or
.Ql NPage )
to send; if the string is not recognised as a key, it is sent as a series of
characters.
All arguments are sent sequentially from first to last.
.Pp
The
.Fl l
flag disables key name lookup and processes the keys as literal UTF-8
characters.
The
.Fl H
flag expects each key to be a hexadecimal number for an ASCII character.
.Pp
The
.Fl R
flag causes the terminal state to be reset.
.Pp
.Fl M
passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
.Sx MOUSE SUPPORT ) .
.Pp
.Fl X
is used to send a command into copy mode - see
the
.Sx WINDOWS AND PANES
section.
.Fl N
specifies a repeat count and
.Fl F
expands formats in arguments where appropriate.
.It Xo Ic send-prefix
.Op Fl 2
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Xc
Send the prefix key, or with
.Fl 2
the secondary prefix key, to a window as if it was pressed.
.It Xo Ic unbind-key
.Op Fl an
.Op Fl T Ar key-table
.Ar key
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic unbind )
Unbind the command bound to
.Ar key .
.Fl n
and
.Fl T
are the same as for
.Ic bind-key .
If
.Fl a
is present, all key bindings are removed.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The appearance and behaviour of
.Nm
may be modified by changing the value of various options.
There are four types of option:
.Em server options ,
.Em session options
.Em window options
and
.Em pane options .
.Pp
The
.Nm
server has a set of global server options which do not apply to any particular
window or session or pane.
These are altered with the
.Ic set-option
.Fl s
command, or displayed with the
.Ic show-options
.Fl s
command.
.Pp
In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and
there is a separate set of global session options.
Sessions which do not have a particular option configured inherit the value
from the global session options.
Session options are set or unset with the
.Ic set-option
command and may be listed with the
.Ic show-options
command.
The available server and session options are listed under the
.Ic set-option
command.
.Pp
Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window and a set of pane
options to each pane.
Pane options inherit from window options.
This means any pane option may be set as a window option to apply the option to
all panes in the window without the option set, for example these commands will
set the background colour to red for all panes except pane 0:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set -w window-style bg=red
set -pt:.0 window-style bg=blue
.Ed
.Pp
There is also a set of global window options from which any unset window or
pane options are inherited.
Window and pane options are altered with
.Ic set-option
.Fl w
and
.Fl p
commands and displayed with
.Ic show-option
.Fl w
and
.Fl p .
.Pp
.Nm
also supports user options which are prefixed with a
.Ql \&@ .
User options may have any name, so long as they are prefixed with
.Ql \&@ ,
and be set to any string.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux set -wq @foo "abc123"
$ tmux show -wv @foo
abc123
.Ed
.Pp
Commands which set options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic set-option
.Op Fl aFgopqsuw
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Ar option Ar value
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic set )
Set a pane option with
.Fl p ,
a window option with
.Fl w ,
a server option with
.Fl s ,
otherwise a session option.
If the option is not a user option,
.Fl w
or
.Fl s
may be unnecessary -
.Nm
will infer the type from the option name, assuming
.Fl w
for pane options.
If
.Fl g
is given, the global session or window option is set.
.Pp
.Fl F
expands formats in the option value.
The
.Fl u
flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from the global
options (or with
.Fl g ,
restores a global option to the default).
.Pp
The
.Fl o
flag prevents setting an option that is already set and the
.Fl q
flag suppresses errors about unknown or ambiguous options.
.Pp
With
.Fl a ,
and if the option expects a string or a style,
.Ar value
is appended to the existing setting.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set -g status-left "foo"
set -ag status-left "bar"
.Ed
.Pp
Will result in
.Ql foobar .
And:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set -g status-style "bg=red"
set -ag status-style "fg=blue"
.Ed
.Pp
Will result in a red background
.Em and
blue foreground.
Without
.Fl a ,
the result would be the default background and a blue foreground.
.It Xo Ic show-options
.Op Fl AgHpqsvw
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Op Ar option
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic show )
Show the pane options (or a single option if
.Ar option
is provided) with
.Fl p ,
the window options with
.Fl w ,
the server options with
.Fl s ,
otherwise the session options.
If the option is not a user option,
.Fl w
or
.Fl s
may be unnecessary -
.Nm
will infer the type from the option name, assuming
.Fl w
for pane options.
Global session or window options are listed if
.Fl g
is used.
.Fl v
shows only the option value, not the name.
If
.Fl q
is set, no error will be returned if
.Ar option
is unset.
.Fl H
includes hooks (omitted by default).
.Fl A
includes options inherited from a parent set of options, such options are
marked with an asterisk.
.Ar value
depends on the option and may be a number, a string, or a flag (on, off, or
omitted to toggle).
.El
.Pp
Available server options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic backspace Ar key
Set the key sent by
.Nm
for backspace.
.It Ic buffer-limit Ar number
Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of the stack,
old ones are removed from the bottom if necessary to maintain this maximum
length.
.It Xo Ic command-alias[]
.Ar name=value
.Xc
This is an array of custom aliases for commands.
If an unknown command matches
.Ar name ,
it is replaced with
.Ar value .
For example, after:
.Pp
.Dl set -s command-alias[100] zoom='resize-pane -Z'
.Pp
Using:
.Pp
.Dl zoom -t:.1
.Pp
Is equivalent to:
.Pp
.Dl resize-pane -Z -t:.1
.Pp
Note that aliases are expanded when a command is parsed rather than when it is
executed, so binding an alias with
.Ic bind-key
will bind the expanded form.
.It Ic default-terminal Ar terminal
Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session - the
default value of the
.Ev TERM
environment variable.
For
.Nm
to work correctly, this
.Em must
be set to
.Ql screen ,
.Ql tmux
or a derivative of them.
.It Ic copy-command Ar shell-command
Give the command to pipe to if the
.Ic copy-pipe
copy mode command is used without arguments.
.It Ic escape-time Ar time

.Nm
waits after an escape is input to determine if it is part of a function or meta
key sequences.
The default is 500 milliseconds.
.It Ic editor Ar shell-command
Set the command used when
.Nm
runs an editor.
.It Xo Ic exit-empty
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
If enabled (the default), the server will exit when there are no active
sessions.
.It Xo Ic exit-unattached
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached clients.
.It Xo Ic extended-keys
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
When enabled, extended keys are requested from the terminal and if supported
are recognised by
.Nm .
.It Xo Ic focus-events
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
When enabled, focus events are requested from the terminal if supported and
passed through to applications running in
.Nm .
Attached clients should be detached and attached again after changing this
option.
.It Ic history-file Ar path
If not empty, a file to which
.Nm
will write command prompt history on exit and load it from on start.
.It Ic message-limit Ar number
Set the number of error or information messages to save in the message log for
each client.
The default is 100.
.It Xo Ic set-clipboard
.Op Ic on | external | off
.Xc
Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the
.Xr xterm 1
escape sequence, if there is an
.Em \&Ms
entry in the
.Xr terminfo 5
description (see the
.Sx TERMINFO EXTENSIONS
section).
.Pp
If set to
.Ic on ,
.Nm
will both accept the escape sequence to create a buffer and attempt to set
the terminal clipboard.
If set to
.Ic external ,
.Nm
will attempt to set the terminal clipboard but ignore attempts
by applications to set
.Nm
buffers.
If
.Ic off ,
.Nm
will neither accept the clipboard escape sequence nor attempt to set the
clipboard.
.Pp
Note that this feature needs to be enabled in
.Xr xterm 1
by setting the resource:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop
.Ed
.Pp
Or changing this property from the
.Xr xterm 1
interactive menu when required.
.It Ic terminal-features[] Ar string
Set terminal features for terminal types read from
.Xr terminfo 5 .
.Nm
has a set of named terminal features.
Each will apply appropriate changes to the
.Xr terminfo 5
entry in use.
.Pp
.Nm
can detect features for a few common terminals; this option can be used to
easily tell tmux about features supported by terminals it cannot detect.
The
.Ic terminal-overrides
option allows individual
.Xr terminfo 5
capabilities to be set instead,
.Ic terminal-features
is intended for classes of functionality supported in a standard way but not
reported by
.Xr terminfo 5 .
Care must be taken only to configure this with features the terminal actually
support.
.Pp
This is an array option where each entry is a colon-separated string made up
of a terminal type pattern (matched using
.Xr fnmatch 3 )
followed by a list of terminal features.
The available features are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 256
Supports 256 colours with the SGR escape sequences.
.It clipboard
Allows setting the system clipboard.
.It ccolour
Allows setting the cursor colour.
.It cstyle
Allows setting the cursor style.
.It margins
Supports DECSLRM margins.

Allows underscore style and colour to be set.
.It UTF-8
Is able to handle UTF-8 output.
.El
.It Ic terminal-overrides[] Ar string
Allow terminal descriptions read using
.Xr terminfo 5
to be overridden.
Each entry is a colon-separated string made up of a terminal type pattern
(matched using
.Xr fnmatch 3 )
and a set of
.Em name=value
entries.
.Pp
For example, to set the
.Ql clear
.Xr terminfo 5
entry to
.Ql \ee[H\ee[2J
for all terminal types matching
.Ql rxvt* :
.Pp
.Dl "rxvt*:clear=\ee[H\ee[2J"
.Pp
The terminal entry value is passed through
.Xr strunvis 3
before interpretation.
.It Ic user-keys[] Ar key
Set list of user-defined key escape sequences.
Each item is associated with a key named
.Ql User0 ,
.Ql User1 ,
and so on.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set -s user-keys[0] "\ee[5;30012~"
bind User0 resize-pane -L 3

.Ic monitor-activity
being off),
.Ic current
means only activity in windows other than the current window are ignored and
.Ic other
means activity in the current window is ignored but not those in other windows.
.It Ic assume-paste-time Ar milliseconds

.Ic default-shell
option.
.It Ic default-shell Ar path
Specify the default shell.
This is used as the login shell for new windows when the
.Ic default-command
option is set to empty, and must be the full path of the executable.
When started
.Nm
tries to set a default value from the first suitable of the
.Ev SHELL
environment variable, the shell returned by
.Xr getpwuid 3 ,
or
.Pa /bin/sh .
This option should be configured when
.Nm
is used as a login shell.

.Sh HOOKS
.Nm
allows commands to run on various triggers, called
.Em hooks .
Most
.Nm
commands have an
.Em after
hook and there are a number of hooks not associated with commands.
.Pp
Hooks are stored as array options, members of the array are executed in
order when the hook is triggered.
Like options different hooks may be global or belong to a session, window or pane.
Hooks may be configured with the
.Ic set-hook
or
.Ic set-option
commands and displayed with
.Ic show-hooks
or
.Ic show-options
.Fl H .
The following two commands are equivalent:
.Bd -literal -offset indent.
set-hook -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'
set-option -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'
.Ed
.Pp
Setting a hook without specifying an array index clears the hook and sets the
first member of the array.
.Pp
A command's after
hook is run after it completes, except when the command is run as part of a hook
itself.
They are named with an
.Ql after-
prefix.
For example, the following command adds a hook to select the even-vertical
layout after every
.Ic split-window :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set-hook -g after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"
.Ed
.Pp
All the notifications listed in the
.Sx CONTROL MODE
section are hooks (without any arguments), except
.Ic %exit .
The following additional hooks are available:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
.It alert-activity
Run when a window has activity.
See
.Ic monitor-activity .
.It alert-bell
Run when a window has received a bell.
See
.Ic monitor-bell .
.It alert-silence
Run when a window has been silent.
See
.Ic monitor-silence .
.It client-attached
Run when a client is attached.
.It client-detached
Run when a client is detached
.It client-resized
Run when a client is resized.
.It client-session-changed
Run when a client's attached session is changed.
.It pane-died
Run when the program running in a pane exits, but
.Ic remain-on-exit
is on so the pane has not closed.
.It pane-exited
Run when the program running in a pane exits.
.It pane-focus-in
Run when the focus enters a pane, if the
.Ic focus-events
option is on.
.It pane-focus-out
Run when the focus exits a pane, if the
.Ic focus-events
option is on.
.It pane-set-clipboard
Run when the terminal clipboard is set using the
.Xr xterm 1
escape sequence.
.It session-created
Run when a new session created.
.It session-closed
Run when a session closed.
.It session-renamed
Run when a session is renamed.
.It window-linked
Run when a window is linked into a session.
.It window-renamed
Run when a window is renamed.
.It window-unlinked
Run when a window is unlinked from a session.
.El
.Pp
Hooks are managed with these commands:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic set-hook
.Op Fl agpRuw
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Ar hook-name
.Ar command
.Xc
Without
.Fl R ,
sets (or with
.Fl u
unsets) hook
.Ar hook-name
to
.Ar command .
The flags are the same as for
.Ic set-option .
.Pp
With
.Fl R ,
run
.Ar hook-name
immediately.
.It Xo Ic show-hooks
.Op Fl gpw
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Xc
Shows hooks.
The flags are the same as for
.Ic show-options .
.El
.Sh MOUSE SUPPORT
If the
.Ic mouse
option is on (the default is off),
.Nm
allows mouse events to be bound as keys.
The name of each key is made up of a mouse event (such as
.Ql MouseUp1 )
and a location suffix, one of the following:
.Bl -column "XXXXXXXXXXXXX" -offset indent
.It Li "Pane" Ta "the contents of a pane"
.It Li "Border" Ta "a pane border"
.It Li "Status" Ta "the status line window list"
.It Li "StatusLeft" Ta "the left part of the status line"
.It Li "StatusRight" Ta "the right part of the status line"
.It Li "StatusDefault" Ta "any other part of the status line"
.El
.Pp
The following mouse events are available:
.Bl -column "MouseDown1" "MouseDrag1" "WheelDown" -offset indent
.It Li "WheelUp" Ta "WheelDown" Ta ""
.It Li "MouseDown1" Ta "MouseUp1" Ta "MouseDrag1" Ta "MouseDragEnd1"
.It Li "MouseDown2" Ta "MouseUp2" Ta "MouseDrag2" Ta "MouseDragEnd2"
.It Li "MouseDown3" Ta "MouseUp3" Ta "MouseDrag3" Ta "MouseDragEnd3"
.It Li "SecondClick1" Ta "SecondClick2" Ta "SecondClick3"
.It Li "DoubleClick1" Ta "DoubleClick2" Ta "DoubleClick3"
.It Li "TripleClick1" Ta "TripleClick2" Ta "TripleClick3"
.El
.Pp
The
.Ql SecondClick
events are fired for the second click of a double click, even if there may be a
third click which will fire
.Ql TripleClick
instead of
.Ql DoubleClick .
.Pp
Each should be suffixed with a location, for example
.Ql MouseDown1Status .
.Pp
The special token
.Ql {mouse}
or
.Ql =
may be used as
.Ar target-window
or
.Ar target-pane
in commands bound to mouse key bindings.
It resolves to the window or pane over which the mouse event took place
(for example, the window in the status line over which button 1 was released for a
.Ql MouseUp1Status
binding, or the pane over which the wheel was scrolled for a
.Ql WheelDownPane
binding).
.Pp
The
.Ic send-keys
.Fl M
flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.
.Pp
The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize panes,
to copy text and to change window using the status line.
These take effect if the
.Ic mouse
option is turned on.
.Sh FORMATS
Certain commands accept the
.Fl F
flag with a
.Ar format
argument.
This is a string which controls the output format of the command.
Format variables are enclosed in
.Ql #{
and
.Ql } ,
for example
.Ql #{session_name} .
The possible variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a
.Nm
option may be used for an option's value.
Some variables have a shorter alias such as
.Ql #S ;
.Ql ##
is replaced by a single
.Ql # ,
.Ql #,
by a
.Ql \&,
and
.Ql #}
by a
.Ql } .
.Pp
Conditionals are available by prefixing with
.Ql \&?
and separating two alternatives with a comma;
if the specified variable exists and is not zero, the first alternative
is chosen, otherwise the second is used.
For example
.Ql #{?session_attached,attached,not attached}
will include the string
.Ql attached
if the session is attached and the string
.Ql not attached
if it is unattached, or
.Ql #{?automatic-rename,yes,no}
will include
.Ql yes
if
.Ic automatic-rename
is enabled, or
.Ql no
if not.
Conditionals can be nested arbitrarily.
Inside a conditional,
.Ql \&,
and
.Ql }
must be escaped as
.Ql #,
and
.Ql #} ,
unless they are part of a
.Ql #{...}
replacement.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#{?pane_in_mode,#[fg=white#,bg=red],#[fg=red#,bg=white]}#W .
.Ed
.Pp
String comparisons may be expressed by prefixing two comma-separated
alternatives by
.Ql == ,
.Ql != ,
.Ql < ,
.Ql > ,
.Ql <=
or
.Ql >=
and a colon.
For example
.Ql #{==:#{host},myhost}
will be replaced by
.Ql 1
if running on
.Ql myhost ,
otherwise by
.Ql 0 .
.Ql ||
and
.Ql &&
evaluate to true if either or both of two comma-separated alternatives are
true, for example
.Ql #{||:#{pane_in_mode},#{alternate_on}} .
.Pp
An
.Ql m
specifies an
.Xr fnmatch 3
or regular expression comparison.
The first argument is the pattern and the second the string to compare.
An optional argument specifies flags:
.Ql r
means the pattern is a regular expression instead of the default
.Xr fnmatch 3
pattern, and
.Ql i
means to ignore case.
For example:
.Ql #{m:*foo*,#{host}}
or
.Ql #{m/ri:^A,MYVAR} .
A
.Ql C
performs a search for an
.Xr fnmatch 3
pattern or regular expression in the pane content and evaluates to zero if not
found, or a line number if found.
Like
.Ql m ,
an
.Ql r
flag means search for a regular expression and
.Ql i
ignores case.
For example:
.Ql #{C/r:^Start}
.Pp
Numeric operators may be performed by prefixing two comma-separated alternatives with an
.Ql e
and an operator.
An optional
.Ql f
flag may be given after the operator to use floating point numbers, otherwise integers are used.
This may be followed by a number giving the number of decimal places to use for the result.
The available operators are:
addition
.Ql + ,
subtraction
.Ql - ,
multiplication
.Ql * ,
division
.Ql / ,
and modulus
.Ql m
or
.Ql %
(note that
.Ql %
must be escaped as
.Ql %%
in formats which are also expanded by
.Xr strftime 3 ) .
For example,
.Ql #{e|*|f|4:5.5,3}
multiplies 5.5 by 3 for a result with four decimal places and
.Ql #{e|%%:7,3}
returns the modulus of 7 and 3.
.Pp
A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it
by an
.Ql = ,
a number and a colon.
Positive numbers count from the start of the string and negative from the end,
so
.Ql #{=5:pane_title}
will include at most the first five characters of the pane title, or
.Ql #{=-5:pane_title}
the last five characters.
A suffix or prefix may be given as a second argument - if provided then it is
appended or prepended to the string if the length has been trimmed, for example
.Ql #{=/5/...:pane_title}
will append
.Ql ...
if the pane title is more than five characters.
Similarly,
.Ql p
pads the string to a given width, for example
.Ql #{p10:pane_title}
will result in a width of at least 10 characters.
A positive width pads on the left, a negative on the right.
.Pp
Prefixing a time variable with
.Ql t:\&
will convert it to a string, so if
.Ql #{window_activity}
gives
.Ql 1445765102 ,
.Ql #{t:window_activity}
gives
.Ql Sun Oct 25 09:25:02 2015 .
Adding
.Ql p (
.Ql `t/p` )
will use shorter but less accurate time format for times in the past.
A custom format may be given using an
.Ql f
suffix (note that
.Ql %
must be escaped as
.Ql %%
if the format is separately being passed through
.Xr strftime 3 ,
for example in the
.Ic status-left
option):
.Ql #{t/f/%%H#:%%M:window_activity} ,
see
.Xr strftime 3 .
.Pp
The
.Ql b:\&
and
.Ql d:\&
prefixes are
.Xr basename 3
and
.Xr dirname 3
of the variable respectively.
.Ql q:\&
will escape
.Xr sh 1
special characters.
.Ql E:\&
will expand the format twice, for example
.Ql #{E:status-left}
is the result of expanding the content of the
.Ic status-left
option rather than the option itself.
.Ql T:\&
is like
.Ql E:\&
but also expands
.Xr strftime 3
specifiers.
.Ql S:\& ,
.Ql W:\&
or
.Ql P:\&
will loop over each session, window or pane and insert the format once
for each.
For windows and panes, two comma-separated formats may be given:
the second is used for the current window or active pane.
For example, to get a list of windows formatted like the status line:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#{W:#{E:window-status-format} ,#{E:window-status-current-format} }
.Ed
.Pp
A prefix of the form
.Ql s/foo/bar/:\&
will substitute
.Ql foo
with
.Ql bar
throughout.
The first argument may be an extended regular expression and a final argument may be
.Ql i
to ignore case, for example
.Ql s/a(.)/\e1x/i:\&
would change
.Ql abABab
into
.Ql bxBxbx .
.Pp
In addition, the last line of a shell command's output may be inserted using
.Ql #() .
For example,
.Ql #(uptime)
will insert the system's uptime.
When constructing formats,
.Nm
does not wait for
.Ql #()
commands to finish; instead, the previous result from running the same command is used,
or a placeholder if the command has not been run before.
If the command hasn't exited, the most recent line of output will be used, but the status
line will not be updated more than once a second.
Commands are executed with the
.Nm
global environment set (see the
.Sx GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT
section).
.Pp
An
.Ql l
specifies that a string should be interpreted literally and not expanded.
For example
.Ql #{l:#{?pane_in_mode,yes,no}}
will be replaced by
.Ql #{?pane_in_mode,yes,no} .
.Pp

.Sh STYLES
.Nm
offers various options to specify the colour and attributes of aspects of the
interface, for example
.Ic status-style
for the status line.
In addition, embedded styles may be specified in format options, such as
.Ic status-left ,
by enclosing them in
.Ql #[
and
.Ql \&] .
.Pp
A style may be the single term
.Ql default
to specify the default style (which may come from an option, for example
.Ic status-style
in the status line) or a space
or comma separated list of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic fg=colour
Set the foreground colour.
The colour is one of:
.Ic black ,
.Ic red ,
.Ic green ,
.Ic yellow ,
.Ic blue ,
.Ic magenta ,
.Ic cyan ,
.Ic white ;
if supported the bright variants
.Ic brightred ,
.Ic brightgreen ,
.Ic brightyellow ;
.Ic colour0
to
.Ic colour255
from the 256-colour set;
.Ic default
for the default colour;
.Ic terminal
for the terminal default colour; or a hexadecimal RGB string such as
.Ql #ffffff .
.It Ic bg=colour
Set the background colour.
.It Ic none
Set no attributes (turn off any active attributes).
.It Xo Ic acs ,
.Ic bright
(or
.Ic bold ) ,
.Ic dim ,
.Ic underscore ,
.Ic blink ,
.Ic reverse ,
.Ic hidden ,
.Ic italics ,
.Ic overline ,
.Ic strikethrough ,
.Ic double-underscore ,
.Ic curly-underscore ,
.Ic dotted-underscore ,
.Ic dashed-underscore
.Xc
Set an attribute.
Any of the attributes may be prefixed with
.Ql no
to unset.
.Ic acs
is the terminal alternate character set.
.It Xo Ic align=left
(or
.Ic noalign ) ,
.Ic align=centre ,
.Ic align=right
.Xc
Align text to the left, centre or right of the available space if appropriate.
.It Ic fill=colour
Fill the available space with a background colour if appropriate.
.It Xo Ic list=on ,
.Ic list=focus ,
.Ic list=left-marker ,
.Ic list=right-marker ,
.Ic nolist
.Xc
Mark the position of the various window list components in the
.Ic status-format
option:
.Ic list=on
marks the start of the list;
.Ic list=focus
is the part of the list that should be kept in focus if the entire list won't fit
in the available space (typically the current window);
.Ic list=left-marker
and
.Ic list=right-marker
mark the text to be used to mark that text has been trimmed from the left or
right of the list if there is not enough space.
.It Xo Ic push-default ,
.Ic pop-default
.Xc
Store the current colours and attributes as the default or reset to the previous
default.
A
.Ic push-default
affects any subsequent use of the
.Ic default
term until a
.Ic pop-default .
Only one default may be pushed (each
.Ic push-default
replaces the previous saved default).
.It Xo Ic range=left ,
.Ic range=right ,
.Ic range=window|X ,
.Ic norange
.Xc
Mark a range in the
.Ic status-format
option.
.Ic range=left
and
.Ic range=right
are the text used for the
.Ql StatusLeft
and
.Ql StatusRight
mouse keys.
.Ic range=window|X
is the range for a window passed to the
.Ql Status
mouse key, where
.Ql X
is a window index.
.El
.Pp
Examples are:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
fg=yellow bold underscore blink
bg=black,fg=default,noreverse
.Ed
.Sh NAMES AND TITLES
.Nm
distinguishes between names and titles.
Windows and sessions have names, which may be used to specify them in targets
and are displayed in the status line and various lists: the name is the
.Nm
identifier for a window or session.
Only panes have titles.
A pane's title is typically set by the program running inside the pane using
an escape sequence (like it would set the
.Xr xterm 1
window title in
.Xr X 7 ) .
Windows themselves do not have titles - a window's title is the title of its
active pane.
.Nm
itself may set the title of the terminal in which the client is running, see
the
.Ic set-titles
option.
.Pp
A session's name is set with the
.Ic new-session
and
.Ic rename-session
commands.
A window's name is set with one of:
.Bl -enum -width Ds
.It
A command argument (such as
.Fl n
for
.Ic new-window
or
.Ic new-session ) .
.It
An escape sequence (if the
.Ic allow-rename
option is turned on):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ printf '\e033kWINDOW_NAME\e033\e\e'
.Ed
.It
Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command in the window's
active pane.
See the
.Ic automatic-rename
option.
.El
.Pp
When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.
A pane's title can be set via the title setting escape sequence, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ printf '\e033]2;My Title\e033\e\e'
.Ed
.Pp
It can also be modified with the
.Ic select-pane
.Fl T
command.
.Sh GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT
When the server is started,
.Nm
copies the environment into the
.Em global environment ;
in addition, each session has a
.Em session environment .
When a window is created, the session and global environments are merged.
If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is used.
The result is the initial environment passed to the new process.
.Pp
The
.Ic update-environment
session option may be used to update the session environment from the client
when a new session is created or an old reattached.
.Nm
also initialises the
.Ev TMUX
variable with some internal information to allow commands to be executed
from inside, and the
.Ev TERM
variable with the correct terminal setting of
.Ql screen .
.Pp
Variables in both session and global environments may be marked as hidden.
Hidden variables are not passed into the environment of new processes and
instead can only be used by tmux itself (for example in formats, see the
.Sx FORMATS
section).
.Pp
Commands to alter and view the environment are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic set-environment
.Op Fl hgru
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Ar name Op Ar value
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic setenv )
Set or unset an environment variable.
If
.Fl g
is used, the change is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is applied
to the session environment for
.Ar target-session .
The
.Fl u
flag unsets a variable.
.Fl r
indicates the variable is to be removed from the environment before starting a
new process.
.Fl h
marks the variable as hidden.
.It Xo Ic show-environment
.Op Fl hgs
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Op Ar variable
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic showenv )
Display the environment for
.Ar target-session
or the global environment with
.Fl g .
If
.Ar variable
is omitted, all variables are shown.
Variables removed from the environment are prefixed with
.Ql - .
If
.Fl s
is used, the output is formatted as a set of Bourne shell commands.
.Fl h
shows hidden variables (omitted by default).
.El
.Sh STATUS LINE
.Nm
includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each
terminal.
.Pp
By default, the status line is enabled and one line in height (it may be
disabled or made multiple lines with the
.Ic status
session option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the current
session in square brackets; the window list; the title of the active pane
in double quotes; and the time and date.
.Pp
Each line of the status line is configured with the
.Ic status-format
option.
The default is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which
may contain dynamic content such as the time or output from a shell command,
see the
.Ic status-left ,
.Ic status-left-length ,
.Ic status-right ,
and
.Ic status-right-length
options below), and a central window list.
By default, the window list shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the
windows present in the current session in ascending numerical order.
It may be customised with the
.Ar window-status-format
and
.Ar window-status-current-format
options.
The flag is one of the following symbols appended to the window name:
.Bl -column "Symbol" "Meaning" -offset indent
.It Sy "Symbol" Ta Sy "Meaning"
.It Li "*" Ta "Denotes the current window."
.It Li "-" Ta "Marks the last window (previously selected)."
.It Li "#" Ta "Window activity is monitored and activity has been detected."
.It Li "\&!" Ta "Window bells are monitored and a bell has occurred in the window."
.It Li "~" Ta "The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval."
.It Li "M" Ta "The window contains the marked pane."
.It Li "Z" Ta "The window's active pane is zoomed."
.El
.Pp
The # symbol relates to the
.Ic monitor-activity
window option.
The window name is printed in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or
silence) is present.
.Pp
The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire
status line using the
.Ic status-style
session option and individual windows using the
.Ic window-status-style
window option.
.Pp
The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the
interval may be controlled with the
.Ic status-interval
session option.
.Pp
Commands related to the status line are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic command-prompt
.Op Fl 1ikNTW
.Op Fl I Ar inputs
.Op Fl p Ar prompts
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Op Ar template
.Xc
Open the command prompt in a client.
This may be used from inside
.Nm
to execute commands interactively.
.Pp
If
.Ar template
is specified, it is used as the command.
If present,
.Fl I
is a comma-separated list of the initial text for each prompt.
If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar prompts
is a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise
a single prompt is displayed, constructed from
.Ar template
if it is present, or
.Ql \&:
if not.
.Pp
Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string
.Ql %%
and all occurrences of
.Ql %1
are replaced by the response to the first prompt, all
.Ql %2
are replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so on for further
prompts.
Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced
.Po
.Ql %1
to
.Ql %9
.Pc .
.Ql %%%
is like
.Ql %%
but any quotation marks are escaped.
.Pp
.Fl 1
makes the prompt only accept one key press, in this case the resulting input
is a single character.
.Fl k
is like
.Fl 1
but the key press is translated to a key name.
.Fl N
makes the prompt only accept numeric key presses.
.Fl i
executes the command every time the prompt input changes instead of when the
user exits the command prompt.
.Fl T
tells
.Nm
that the prompt is for a target which affects what completions are offered when
.Em Tab
is pressed;
.Fl W
is similar but indicates the prompt is for a window.
.Pp
The following keys have a special meaning in the command prompt, depending
on the value of the
.Ic status-keys
option:
.Bl -column "FunctionXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" "viXXXX" "emacsX" -offset indent
.It Sy "Function" Ta Sy "vi" Ta Sy "emacs"
.It Li "Cancel command prompt" Ta "q" Ta "Escape"
.It Li "Delete from cursor to start of word" Ta "" Ta "C-w"
.It Li "Delete entire command" Ta "d" Ta "C-u"
.It Li "Delete from cursor to end" Ta "D" Ta "C-k"
.It Li "Execute command" Ta "Enter" Ta "Enter"
.It Li "Get next command from history" Ta "" Ta "Down"
.It Li "Get previous command from history" Ta "" Ta "Up"
.It Li "Insert top paste buffer" Ta "p" Ta "C-y"
.It Li "Look for completions" Ta "Tab" Ta "Tab"
.It Li "Move cursor left" Ta "h" Ta "Left"
.It Li "Move cursor right" Ta "l" Ta "Right"
.It Li "Move cursor to end" Ta "$" Ta "C-e"
.It Li "Move cursor to next word" Ta "w" Ta "M-f"
.It Li "Move cursor to previous word" Ta "b" Ta "M-b"
.It Li "Move cursor to start" Ta "0" Ta "C-a"
.It Li "Transpose characters" Ta "" Ta "C-t"
.El
.It Xo Ic confirm-before
.Op Fl p Ar prompt
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Ar command
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic confirm )
Ask for confirmation before executing
.Ar command .
If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar prompt
is the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt is constructed from

.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic menu )
Display a menu on
.Ar target-client .
.Ar target-pane
gives the target for any commands run from the menu.
.Pp
A menu is passed as a series of arguments: first the menu item name,
second the key shortcut (or empty for none) and third the command
to run when the menu item is chosen.
The name and command are formats, see the
.Sx FORMATS
and
.Sx STYLES
sections.
If the name begins with a hyphen (-), then the item is disabled (shown dim) and
may not be chosen.
The name may be empty for a separator line, in which case both the key and
command should be omitted.
.Pp
.Fl T
is a format for the menu title (see
.Sx FORMATS ) .
.Pp
.Fl x
and
.Fl y
give the position of the menu.
Both may be a row or column number, or one of the following special values:
.Bl -column "XXXXX" "XXXX" -offset indent
.It Sy "Value" Ta Sy "Flag" Ta Sy "Meaning"
.It Li "C" Ta "Both" Ta "The centre of the terminal"
.It Li "R" Ta Fl x Ta "The right side of the terminal"
.It Li "P" Ta "Both" Ta "The bottom left of the pane"
.It Li "M" Ta "Both" Ta "The mouse position"
.It Li "W" Ta "Both" Ta "The window position on the status line"
.It Li "S" Ta Fl y Ta "The line above or below the status line"
.El
.Pp
Each menu consists of items followed by a key shortcut shown in brackets.
If the menu is too large to fit on the terminal, it is not displayed.
Pressing the key shortcut chooses the corresponding item.
If the mouse is enabled and the menu is opened from a mouse key binding, releasing
the mouse button with an item selected will choose that item.
The following keys are also available:
.Bl -column "Key" "Function" -offset indent
.It Sy "Key" Ta Sy "Function"
.It Li "Enter" Ta "Choose selected item"
.It Li "Up" Ta "Select previous item"
.It Li "Down" Ta "Select next item"

.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic popup )
Display a popup on
.Ar target-client .
A popup is a rectangular box drawn over the top of any panes.
Panes are not updated while a popup is present.
The popup content may be given in two ways:
.Bl -enum -offset Ds
.It
A set of lines as arguments.
Each line is a format which is expanded using
.Ar target-pane
as the target.
If a line contains newlines it is split into multiple lines.
Lines may use styles, see the
.Sx STYLES
section.
.It
A shell command given by
.Fl R
which is run and any output shown in the pane.
.El
.Pp
The first argument,
.Ar command ,
is a
.Nm
command which is run when a key is pressed.
The key is available in the
.Ql popup_key
format.
After
.Ar command
is run, the popup is closed.
It may be empty to discard any key presses.
If
.Fl K
is given together with
.Fl R ,
key presses are instead passed to the
.Fl R
shell command.
.Fl E
closes the popup automatically when
.Ar shell-command
exits.
Two
.Fl E
closes the popup only if
.Ar shell-command
exited with success.
With
.Fl K ,
.Ql Escape
and
.Ql C-c
close the popup unless
.Fl E
is also given.
.Pp
.Fl x
and
.Fl y
give the position of the popup, they have the same meaning as for the
.Ic display-menu
command.
.Fl w
and
.Fl h
give the width and height - both may be a percentage (followed by
.Ql % ) .
If omitted, without
.Fl R
they are calculated from the given lines and with
.Fl R
they use half the terminal size.
.Pp
The
.Fl C
flag closes any popup on the client.
.El
.Sh BUFFERS
.Nm
maintains a set of named
.Em paste buffers .
Each buffer may be either explicitly or automatically named.
Explicitly named buffers are named when created with the
.Ic set-buffer
or
.Ic load-buffer
commands, or by renaming an automatically named buffer with
.Ic set-buffer
.Fl n .
Automatically named buffers are given a name such as
.Ql buffer0001 ,
.Ql buffer0002
and so on.
When the
.Ic buffer-limit
option is reached, the oldest automatically named buffer is deleted.
Explicitly named buffers are not subject to
.Ic buffer-limit
and may be deleted with the
.Ic delete-buffer
command.
.Pp
Buffers may be added using
.Ic copy-mode
or the
.Ic set-buffer
and
.Ic load-buffer
commands, and pasted into a window using the
.Ic paste-buffer
command.
If a buffer command is used and no buffer is specified, the most
recently added automatically named buffer is assumed.
.Pp
A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.
By default, up to 2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the
.Ic history-limit
option (see the
.Ic set-option
command above).
.Pp
The buffer commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic choose-buffer
.Op Fl NZr
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl f Ar filter
.Op Fl O Ar sort-order
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Op Ar template
.Xc
Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from
a list.
.Fl Z
zooms the pane.
The following keys may be used in buffer mode:
.Bl -column "Key" "Function" -offset indent
.It Sy "Key" Ta Sy "Function"
.It Li "Enter" Ta "Paste selected buffer"
.It Li "Up" Ta "Select previous buffer"
.It Li "Down" Ta "Select next buffer"
.It Li "C-s" Ta "Search by name or content"
.It Li "n" Ta "Repeat last search"
.It Li "t" Ta "Toggle if buffer is tagged"
.It Li "T" Ta "Tag no buffers"
.It Li "C-t" Ta "Tag all buffers"
.It Li "p" Ta "Paste selected buffer"
.It Li "P" Ta "Paste tagged buffers"
.It Li "d" Ta "Delete selected buffer"
.It Li "D" Ta "Delete tagged buffers"
.It Li "e" Ta "Open the buffer in an editor"
.It Li "f" Ta "Enter a format to filter items"
.It Li "O" Ta "Change sort field"
.It Li "r" Ta "Reverse sort order"
.It Li "v" Ta "Toggle preview"
.It Li "q" Ta "Exit mode"
.El
.Pp
After a buffer is chosen,
.Ql %%
is replaced by the buffer name in
.Ar template
and the result executed as a command.
If
.Ar template
is not given, "paste-buffer -b '%%'" is used.
.Pp
.Fl O
specifies the initial sort field: one of
.Ql time ,
.Ql name
or
.Ql size .
.Fl r
reverses the sort order.
.Fl f
specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero,
the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.
If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.
.Fl F
specifies the format for each item in the list.
.Fl N
starts without the preview.
This command works only if at least one client is attached.
.It Ic clear-history Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.D1 (alias: Ic clearhist )
Remove and free the history for the specified pane.

When output, any linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are replaced with
a separator, by default carriage return (CR).
A custom separator may be specified using the
.Fl s
flag.
The
.Fl r
flag means to do no replacement (equivalent to a separator of LF).
If
.Fl p
is specified, paste bracket control codes are inserted around the
buffer if the application has requested bracketed paste mode.
.It Xo Ic save-buffer
.Op Fl a

If the command doesn't return success, the exit status is also displayed.
.It Xo Ic wait-for
.Op Fl L | S | U
.Ar channel
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic wait )
When used without options, prevents the client from exiting until woken using
.Ic wait-for
.Fl S
with the same channel.
When
.Fl L
is used, the channel is locked and any clients that try to lock the same
channel are made to wait until the channel is unlocked with
.Ic wait-for
.Fl U .
.El
.Sh EXIT MESSAGES
When a
.Nm
client detaches, it prints a message.
This may be one of:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It [detached (from session ...)]
The client was detached normally.
.It [detached and SIGHUP]
The client was detached and its parent sent the
.Dv SIGHUP
signal (for example with
.Ic detach-client
.Fl P ) .
.It [lost tty]
The client's
.Xr tty 4
or
.Xr pty 4
was unexpectedly destroyed.
.It [terminated]
The client was killed with
.Dv SIGTERM .
.It [exited]
The server exited when it had no sessions.
.It [server exited]
The server exited when it received
.Dv SIGTERM .
.It [server exited unexpectedly]
The server crashed or otherwise exited without telling the client the reason.
.El
.Sh TERMINFO EXTENSIONS
.Nm
understands some unofficial extensions to
.Xr terminfo 5 .
It is not normally necessary to set these manually, instead the
.Ic terminal-features
option should be used.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em \&AX
An existing extension that tells
.Nm
the terminal supports default colours.
.It Em \&Cs , Cr
Set the cursor colour.
The first takes a single string argument and is used to set the colour;
the second takes no arguments and restores the default cursor colour.
If set, a sequence such as this may be used
to change the cursor colour from inside
.Nm :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ printf '\e033]12;red\e033\e\e'
.Ed
.It Em \&Cmg, \&Clmg, \&Dsmg , \&Enmg
Set, clear, disable or enable DECSLRM margins.
These are set automatically if the terminal reports it is
.Em VT420
compatible.
.It Em \&Dsbp , \&Enbp
Disable and enable bracketed paste.
These are set automatically if the
.Em XT
capability is present.
.It Em \&Dseks , \&Eneks
Disable and enable extended keys.
.It Em \&Dsfcs , \&Enfcs
Disable and enable focus reporting.
These are set automatically if the
.Em XT
capability is present.
.It Em \&Smol
Enable the overline attribute.
.It Em \&Smulx
Set a styled underscore.
The single parameter is one of: 0 for no underscore, 1 for normal
underscore, 2 for double underscore, 3 for curly underscore, 4 for dotted
underscore and 5 for dashed underscore.
.It Em \&Setulc
Set the underscore colour.
The argument is (red * 65536) + (green * 256) + blue where each is between 0
and 255.
.It Em \&Ss , Se
Set or reset the cursor style.
If set, a sequence such as this may be used
to change the cursor to an underline:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ printf '\e033[4 q'
.Ed
.Pp
If
.Em Se
is not set, \&Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style instead.
.It Em \&Sync
Start (parameter is 1) or end (parameter is 2) a synchronized update.
.It Em \&Tc
Indicate that the terminal supports the
.Ql direct colour
RGB escape sequence (for example, \ee[38;2;255;255;255m).
.Pp
If supported, this is used for the initialize colour escape sequence (which
may be enabled by adding the
.Ql initc
and
.Ql ccc
capabilities to the
.Nm
.Xr terminfo 5
entry).
.Pp
This is equivalent to the
.Em RGB
.Xr terminfo 5
capability.
.It Em \&Ms
Store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection (clipboard).
See the
.Em set-clipboard
option above and the
.Xr xterm 1
man page.
.It Em \&XT
This is an existing extension capability that tmux uses to mean that the
terminal supports the
.Xr xterm 1
title set sequences and to automatically set some of the capabilities above.
.El
.Sh CONTROL MODE
.Nm
offers a textual interface called
.Em control mode .
This allows applications to communicate with
.Nm
using a simple text-only protocol.
.Pp
In control mode, a client sends
.Nm
commands or command sequences terminated by newlines on standard input.
Each command will produce one block of output on standard output.
An output block consists of a
.Em %begin
line followed by the output (which may be empty).
The output block ends with a
.Em %end
or
.Em %error .
.Em %begin
and matching
.Em %end
or
.Em %error
have two arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch) and command number.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
%begin 1363006971 2
0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
%end 1363006971 2
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ic refresh-client
.Fl C
command may be used to set the size of a client in control mode.
.Pp
In control mode,
.Nm
outputs notifications.
A notification will never occur inside an output block.
.Pp
The following notifications are defined:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic %client-session-changed Ar client session-id name
The client is now attached to the session with ID
.Ar session-id ,
which is named
.Ar name .
.It Ic %exit Op Ar reason

client is exiting immediately, either because it is not attached to any session
or an error occurred.
If present,
.Ar reason
describes why the client exited.
.It Ic %layout-change Ar window-id Ar window-layout Ar window-visible-layout Ar window-flags

.Ar window-id
was renamed to
.Ar name .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
When
.Nm
is started, it inspects the following environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width LC_CTYPE
.It Ev EDITOR
If the command specified in this variable contains the string
.Ql vi
and
.Ev VISUAL
is unset, use vi-style key bindings.
Overridden by the
.Ic mode-keys
and
.Ic status-keys
options.
.It Ev HOME
The user's login directory.
If unset, the
.Xr passwd 5
database is consulted.
.It Ev LC_CTYPE
The character encoding
.Xr locale 1 .
It is used for two separate purposes.
For output to the terminal, UTF-8 is used if the
.Fl u
option is given or if
.Ev LC_CTYPE
contains
.Qq UTF-8
or
.Qq UTF8 .
Otherwise, only ASCII characters are written and non-ASCII characters
are replaced with underscores
.Pq Ql _ .
For input,
.Nm
always runs with a UTF-8 locale.
If en_US.UTF-8 is provided by the operating system it is used and
.Ev LC_CTYPE
is ignored for input.
Otherwise,
.Ev LC_CTYPE
tells
.Nm
what the UTF-8 locale is called on the current system.
If the locale specified by
.Ev LC_CTYPE
is not available or is not a UTF-8 locale,
.Nm
exits with an error message.
.It Ev LC_TIME
The date and time format
.Xr locale 1 .
It is used for locale-dependent
.Xr strftime 3
format specifiers.
.It Ev PWD
The current working directory to be set in the global environment.
This may be useful if it contains symbolic links.
If the value of the variable does not match the current working
directory, the variable is ignored and the result of
.Xr getcwd 3
is used instead.
.It Ev SHELL
The absolute path to the default shell for new windows.
See the
.Ic default-shell
option for details.
.It Ev TMUX_TMPDIR
The parent directory of the directory containing the server sockets.
See the
.Fl L
option for details.
.It Ev VISUAL
If the command specified in this variable contains the string
.Ql vi ,
use vi-style key bindings.
Overridden by the
.Ic mode-keys
and
.Ic status-keys
options.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/tmux.confXXX" -compact
.It Pa ~/.tmux.conf
Default
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Pa /etc/tmux.conf
System-wide configuration file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a new
.Nm
session running
.Xr vi 1 :
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux new-session vi
.Pp
Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.
For new-session, this is
.Ic new :
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux new vi
.Pp
Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.
If there are several options, they are listed:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux n
ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window
.Ed
.Pp
Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing
.Ql C-b c
(Ctrl
followed by the
.Ql b
key
followed by the
.Ql c
key).
.Pp
Windows may be navigated with:
.Ql C-b 0
(to select window 0),
.Ql C-b 1
(to select window 1), and so on;
.Ql C-b n
to select the next window; and
.Ql C-b p
to select the previous window.
.Pp
A session may be detached using
.Ql C-b d
(or by an external event such as
.Xr ssh 1
disconnection) and reattached with:
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux attach-session
.Pp
Typing
.Ql C-b \&?
lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may be used
to navigate the list or
.Ql q
to exit from it.
.Pp
Commands to be run when the
.Nm
server is started may be placed in the
.Pa ~/.tmux.conf
configuration file.
Common examples include:
.Pp
Changing the default prefix key:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set-option -g prefix C-a
unbind-key C-b
bind-key C-a send-prefix
.Ed
.Pp
Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set-option -g status off
set-option -g status-style bg=blue
.Ed
.Pp
Setting other options, such as the default command,
or locking after 30 minutes of inactivity:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
set-option -g lock-after-time 1800
.Ed
.Pp
Creating new key bindings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key b set-option status
bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
