.Nm readlink
.Nd display target of symbolic link on standard output
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm readlink
.Op Fl fn
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility when invoked with the pathname of a symbolic link as its
argument dereferences the symbolic link and prints the name of target
on standard output.
If the
.Fl f
option is not specified and
.Nm
is invoked with an argument other
than the pathname of a symbolic link, it exits with a nonzero exit
code without printing anything.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Canonicalize by following every symlink in every component of the given
path recursively.
.Nm
will resolve both absolute and relative paths and
return the absolute pathname corresponding to
.Ar file .
The argument does not need to be a symbolic link.
.It Fl n
Do not print a trailing newline character.
