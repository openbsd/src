.Dt SEQ 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm seq
.Nd print sequences of numbers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl w
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Op Fl s Ar string
.Op Ar first Op Ar incr
.Ar last
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints a sequence of numbers, one per line by default,
from
.Ar first
.Pq default 1
to as near
.Ar last
as possible, in increments of
.Ar incr
.Pq default 1 .
When
.Ar first
is larger than
.Ar last ,
the default
.Ar incr
is -1.
.Pp
All numbers are interpreted as floating point.
.Pp
Normally, integer values are printed as decimal integers.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility accepts the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl f Ar format , Fl -format Ar format
Use a
.Xr printf 3
style
.Ar format
to print each number.
Only the
.Cm A ,
.Cm a ,
.Cm E ,
.Cm e ,
.Cm F ,
.Cm f ,
.Cm G ,
.Cm g ,
and
.Cm %
conversion characters are valid, along with any optional
flags and an optional numeric minimum field width or precision.
The
.Ar format
can contain character escape sequences in backslash notation as
defined in
.St -ansiC .
The default is
.Cm %g .
.It Fl s Ar string , Fl -separator Ar string
Use
.Ar string
to separate numbers.
The
.Ar string
can contain character escape sequences in backslash notation as
defined in
.St -ansiC .
The default is
.Cm \en .
.It Fl w , Fl -fixed-width
Equalize the widths of all numbers by padding with zeros as necessary.
This option has no effect with the
.Fl f
option.
If any sequence numbers will be printed in exponential notation,
the default conversion is changed to
.Cm %e .
.It Fl -help
Display the program usage and exit.
.It Fl -version
Display the version number and exit.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Generate a sequence from 1 to 3 (inclusive) with a default increment of 1:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ seq 1 3
1
2
3
.Ed
.Pp
Generate a sequence from 3 to 1 (inclusive) with a default increment of -1:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ seq 3 1
3
2
1
.Ed
.Pp
Generate a sequence from 0 to 0.1 (inclusive) with an increment of 0.05
and padding with leading zeroes:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ seq -w 0 .05 .1
0.00
0.05
0.10
.Ed
.Pp
Generate a sequence from 1 to 3 (inclusive) with a default increment of 1,
and a custom separator string:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ seq -s "," 1 3
1,2,3
.Ed
.Pp
Generate a sequence from 1 to 2 (inclusive) with an increment of 0.2 and
print the results with two digits after the decimal point (using a
.Xr printf 3
style format):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ seq -f %.2f 1 0.2 2
1.00
1.20
1.40
1.60
1.80
2.00

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
Version\~8
.At .
This version of
.Nm
appeared in
.Nx 3.0
and was ported to
.Ox 7.1 .
It was based on the command of the same name in
Plan 9 from Bell Labs and the GNU core utilities.
The GNU
.Nm
command first appeared in the 1.13 shell utilities release.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl w
option does not handle the transition from pure floating point
to exponent representation very well.
The
.Nm
utility is not bug for bug compatible with other implementations.
