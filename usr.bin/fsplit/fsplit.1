.Sh NAME
.Nm fsplit
.Nd split a multi-routine Fortran file into individual files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fsplit
.Op Fl e Ar efile Op Ar ...
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes as input either a file or standard input containing Fortran source code.
It attempts to split the input into separate routine files of the
form
.Ar name.f ,
where
.Ar name
is the name of the program unit (e.g., function, subroutine, block data or
program).
.Pp
The name for unnamed block data subprograms has the form
.Ar blkdtaNNN.f ,
where NNN is three digits and a file of this name does not already exist.
For unnamed main programs the name has the form
.Ar mainNNN.f .
If there is an error in classifying a program unit, or if
.Ar name.f
already exists,
the program unit will be put in a file of the form
.Ar zzzNNN.f ,
where
.Ar zzzNNN.f
does not already exist.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e Ar efile
Normally each subprogram unit is split into a separate file.
When the
.Fl e
option is used, only the specified subprogram units are split into separate
files. e.g.,
.Pp
.Dl $ fsplit -e readit -e doit prog.f
.Pp
will split
.Dq readit
and
.Dq doit
into separate files.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If names specified via the
.Fl e
option are not found, a diagnostic is written to
standard error.
.Sh AUTHORS
Asa Romberger and Jerry Berkman
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
assumes the subprogram name is on the first noncomment line of the subprogram
unit.
Non-standard source formats may confuse
.Nm fsplit .
.Pp
It is hard to use
.Fl e
for unnamed main programs and block data subprograms since you must
predict the created file name.
