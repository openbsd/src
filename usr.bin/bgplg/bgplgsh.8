Border Gateway Protocol daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bgplgsh
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is a looking glass shell for the
.Xr bgpd 8
Border Gateway Protocol daemon.
The looking glass will provide a simple command line interface
with read-only access to a restricted set of
.Xr bgpd 8
and system status information, which is typically used on route
servers by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Internet eXchange
points (IXs).
.Pp
It requires three steps to enable the looking glass shell:
.Bl -enum
.It
Add
.Nm

.Xr adduser 8
for more information about system user management.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# adduser -shell /usr/bin/bgplgsh -batch bgplg
# passwd bgplg

.Xr bgpd 8
and
.Xr bgplg 8
for more information.

set the following in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local

commercial internet exchange point.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
program was written by
.An Reyk Floeter Aq reyk@vantronix.net .
.Sh CAVEATS

For example, this can take effect when using
.Xr traceroute 8
with blackholed or bad routes.
