.Sh NAME
.Nm bgplgsh
.Nd looking glass shell for the OpenBSD Border Gateway Protocol daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bgplgsh
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is a looking glass shell for the
.Xr bgpd 8
Border Gateway Protocol daemon.
The looking glass will provide a simple command line interface
with read-only access to a restricted set of
.Xr bgpd 8
and system status information, which is typically used on route
servers by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Internet eXchange
points (IXs).
.Pp
It requires three steps to enable the looking glass shell:
.Bl -enum
.It
Add
.Nm
as a valid login shell.
See
.Xr shells 5
for more information.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# echo /usr/bin/bgplgsh \*(Gt\*(Gt /etc/shells
.Ed
.It
Create a new user for restricted looking glass access.
See
.Xr adduser 8
for more information about system user management.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# adduser -shell bgplgsh -batch bgplg
# passwd bgplg
.Ed
.It
Start the Border Gateway Protocol daemon with a second,
restricted, control socket.
See
.Xr bgpd.conf 5
and
.Xr bgplg 8
for more information.
.Pp
For example,
add the following to
.Pa /etc/bgpd.conf
to have
.Xr bgpd 8
open a second, restricted, control socket:
.Pp
.Dl socket \&"/var/www/run/bgpd.rsock\&" restricted
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/www/run/bgpd.rsockXX" -compact
.It Pa /var/www/run/bgpd.rsock
Position of the second, restricted, control socket of
.Xr bgpd 8 .

.Xr bgplg 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared in
.Ox 4.1 .
The initial implementation was done in 2005 for DE-CIX, the German
commercial internet exchange point.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
program was written by
.An Reyk Floeter Aq Mt reyk@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
To prevent commands from running endlessly,
.Nm
will kill the corresponding processes after a hard limit of 60 seconds.
For example, this can take effect when using
.Xr traceroute 8
with blackholed or bad routes.
