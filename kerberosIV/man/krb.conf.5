.TH KRB.CONF 5 "Kerberos Version 4.0" "MIT Project Athena"
.SH NAME
/etc/kerberosIV/krb.conf \- Kerberos configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I krb.conf
contains configuration information describing the Kerberos realm and the
Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) servers for known realms.
.PP
.I krb.conf
contains the name of the local realm in the first
line, followed by lines indicating realm/host
entries.  The first token is a realm name, and the second is the hostname
of a host running a KDC for that realm.
The words "admin server" following the hostname indicate that 
the host also provides an administrative database server.

A hash sign (#) as a first character of the krb.conf file disables kerberos
authentication on the system.

For example:
.nf
.in +1i
ATHENA.MIT.EDU
ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos-1.mit.edu admin server
ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos-2.mit.edu
LCS.MIT.EDU kerberos.lcs.mit.edu admin server
.in -1i
