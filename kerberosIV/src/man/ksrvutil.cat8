     kkssrrvvuuttiill allows a system manager to list or change keys currently in his
     keyfile or to add new keys to the keyfile.

     Operation must be one of the following:

     list    lists the keys in a keyfile showing version number and principal
             name.  If the --kk option is given, keys will also be shown.

     change  changes all the keys in the keyfile by using the regular admin
             protocol.  If the --ii flag is given, kkssrrvvuuttiill will prompt for yes
             or no before changing each key.  If the --kk option is used, the
             old and new keys will be displayed.

     add     allows the user to add a key.  add prompts for name, instance,
             realm, and key version number, asks for confirmation, and then
             asks for a password.  kkssrrvvuuttiill then converts the password to a
             key and appends the keyfile with the new information.  If the --kk
             option is used, the key is displayed.

     get     gets a service from the Kerberos server, possibly creating the
             principal. Names, instances and realms for the service keys to
             get are prompted for. The default principal used in the kadmin
             transcation is your root instance. This can be changed with the
             --pp option.

     In all cases, the default file used is KEY_FILE as defined in krb.h un-
     less this is overridden by the --ff option.

     A good use for kkssrrvvuuttiill would be for adding keys to a keyfile.  A system
     manager could ask a kerberos administrator to create a new service key
     with kadmin(8) and could supply an initial password.  Then, he could use
     kkssrrvvuuttiill to add the key to the keyfile and then to change the key so that
     it will be random and unknown to either the system manager or the ker-
     beros administrator.

     kkssrrvvuuttiill always makes a backup copy of the keyfile before making any
     changes.

     If kkssrrvvuuttiill should exit on an error condition at any time during a change
     or add, a copy of the original keyfile can be found in _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.old where
     _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is the name of the keyfile, and a copy of the file with all new
     keys changed or added so far can be found in _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.work. The original
     keyfile is left unmodified until the program exits at which point it is
     removed and replaced it with the workfile.  Appending the workfile to the
     backup copy and replacing the keyfile with the result should always give
     a usable keyfile, although the resulting keyfile will have some out of
     date keys in it.
