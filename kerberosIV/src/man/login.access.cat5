     llooggiinn..aacccceessss - Login access control table

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The llooggiinn..aacccceessss file specifies (user, host) combinations and/or (user,
     tty) combinations for which a login will be either accepted or refused.

     When someone logs in, the llooggiinn..aacccceessss is scanned for the first entry
     that matches the (user, host) combination, or, in case of non-networked
     logins, the first entry that matches the (user, tty) combination.  The
     permissions field of that table entry determines whether the login will
     be accepted or refused.

     Each line of the login access control table has three fields separated by
     a ":" character:   permission : users : origins

     The first field should be a "+" (access granted) or "-" (access denied)
     character. The second field should be a list of one or more login names,
     group names, or ALL (always matches).  The third field should be a list
     of one or more tty names (for non-networked logins), host names, domain
     names (begin with "."), host addresses, internet network numbers (end
     with "."), ALL (always matches) or LOCAL (matches any string that does
     not contain a "." character). If you run NIS you can use @netgroupname in
     host or user patterns.

     The EXCEPT operator makes it possible to write very compact rules.

     The group file is searched only when a name does not match that of the
     logged-in user. Only groups are matched in which users are explicitly
     listed: the program does not look at a user's primary group id value.
