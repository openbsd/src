      kklliisstt [ --ss | --tt ] [ --ffiillee name ] [ --ssrrvvttaabb ]

      _k_l_i_s_t prints the name of the tickets file and the identity of the
      principal the tickets are for (as listed in the tickets file), and
      lists the principal names of all Kerberos tickets currently held by
      the user, along with the issue and expire time for each authenticator.
      Principal names are listed in the form _n_a_m_e_._i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e_@_r_e_a_l_m_, with the
      '.' omitted if the instance is null, and the '@' omitted if the realm
      is null.

      If given the --ss option, _k_l_i_s_t does not print the issue and expire
      times, the name of the tickets file, or the identity of the principal.

      If given the --tt option, kklliisstt checks for the existence of a non-
      expired ticket-granting-ticket in the ticket file.  If one is present,
      it exits with status 0, else it exits with status 1.  No output is
      generated when this option is specified.

      If given the --ffiillee option, the following argument is used as the
      ticket file.  Otherwise, if the KKRRBBTTKKFFIILLEE environment variable is set,
      it is used.  If this environment variable is not set, the file
      //ttmmpp//ttkktt[[uuiidd]] is used, where uuiidd is the current user-id of the user.

      If given the --ssrrvvttaabb option, the file is treated as a service key
      file, and the names of the keys contained therein are printed.  If no
      file is specified with a --ffiillee option, the default is _/_e_t_c_/_s_r_v_t_a_b.

      /etc/krb.conf       to get the name of the local realm

      /tmp/tkt[uid]       as the default ticket file ([uid] is the decimal
                          UID of the user).

      /etc/srvtab         as the default service key file

      When reading a file as a service key file, very little sanity or error
      checking is performed.
