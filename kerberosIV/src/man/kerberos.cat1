      kerberos - introduction to the Kerberos system


 DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
      The Kerberos system authenticates individual users in a network
      environment.  After authenticating yourself to Kerberos, you can use
      network utilities such as _r_l_o_g_i_n, _r_c_p, and _r_s_h without having to
      present passwords to remote hosts and without having to bother with
      _._r_h_o_s_t_s files.  Note that these utilities will work without passwords
      only if the remote machines you deal with support the Kerberos system.
      All Athena timesharing machines and public workstations support
      Kerberos.

      Before you can use Kerberos, you must register as an Athena user, and
      you must make sure you have been added to the Kerberos database.  You
      can use the _k_i_n_i_t command to find out.  This command tries to log you
      into the Kerberos system.  _k_i_n_i_t will prompt you for a username and
      password.  Enter your username and password.  If the utility lets you
      login without giving you a message, you have already been registered.

      If you enter your username and _k_i_n_i_t responds with this message:

      Principal unknown (kerberos)

      you haven't been registered as a Kerberos user.  See your system
      administrator.

      A Kerberos name contains three parts.  The first is the _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l
      _n_a_m_e_, which is usually a user's or service's name.  The second is the
      _i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e_, which in the case of a user is usually null.  Some users may
      have privileged instances, however, such as ``root'' or ``admin''.  In
      the case of a service, the instance is the name of the machine on
      which it runs; i.e. there can be an _r_l_o_g_i_n service running on the
      machine ABC, which is different from the rlogin service running on the
      machine XYZ.  The third part of a Kerberos name is the _r_e_a_l_m_.  The
      realm corresponds to the Kerberos service providing authentication for
      the principal.  For example, at MIT there is a Kerberos running at the
      Laboratory for Computer Science and one running at Project Athena.

      When writing a Kerberos name, the principal name is separated from the
      instance (if not null) by a period, and the realm (if not the local
      realm) follows, preceded by an ``@'' sign.  The following are examples
      of valid Kerberos names:

              billb
              jis.admin
              srz@lcs.mit.edu
              treese.root@athena.mit.edu

      When you authenticate yourself with Kerberos, through either the

      workstation _t_o_e_h_o_l_d system or the _k_i_n_i_t command, Kerberos gives you an
      initial Kerberos _t_i_c_k_e_t.  (A Kerberos ticket is an encrypted protocol
      message that provides authentication.)  Kerberos uses this ticket for
      network utilities such as _r_l_o_g_i_n and _r_c_p.  The ticket transactions are
      done transparently, so you don't have to worry about their management.

      Note, however, that tickets expire.  Privileged tickets, such as root
      instance tickets, expire in a few minutes, while tickets that carry
      more ordinary privileges may be good for several hours or a day,
      depending on the installation's policy.  If your login session extends
      beyond the time limit, you will have to re-authenticate yourself to
      Kerberos to get new tickets.  Use the _k_i_n_i_t command to re-authenticate
      yourself.

      If you use the _k_i_n_i_t command to get your tickets, make sure you use
      the _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y command to destroy your tickets before you end your login
      session.  You should probably put the _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y command in your _._l_o_g_o_u_t
      file so that your tickets will be destroyed automatically when you
      logout.  For more information about the _k_i_n_i_t and _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y commands,
      see the _k_i_n_i_t_(_1_) and _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y_(_1_) manual pages.

      Currently, Kerberos supports the following network services: _r_l_o_g_i_n,
      _r_s_h, _r_c_p, _p_o_p, _f_t_p, _t_e_l_n_e_t, _A_F_S and _N_F_S_.

      Kerberos will not do authentication forwarding.  In other words, if
      you use _r_l_o_g_i_n to login to a remote host, you cannot use Kerberos
      services from that host until you authenticate yourself explicitly on
      that host.  Although you may need to authenticate yourself on the
      remote host, be aware that when you do so, _r_l_o_g_i_n sends your password
      across the network in clear text.

      The following people helped out on various aspects of the system:

      Jeff Schiller designed and wrote the administration server and its
      user interface, kadmin.  He also wrote the dbm version of the database
      management system.

      Mark Colan developed the Kerberos versions of _r_l_o_g_i_n, _r_s_h, and _r_c_p, as
      well as contributing work on the servers.
