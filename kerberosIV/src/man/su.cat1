     ssuu - substitute user identity

     ssuu [--KKffllmmii] [_l_o_g_i_n [_s_h_e_l_l _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]]

     SSuu requests the Kerberos password for _l_o_g_i_n (or for ``_l_o_g_i_n.root'', if no
     login is provided), and switches to that user and group ID after obtain-
     ing a Kerberos ticket granting ticket.  A shell is then executed, and any
     additional _s_h_e_l_l _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s after the login name are passed to the shell.
     SSuu will resort to the local password file to find the password for _l_o_g_i_n
     if there is a Kerberos error.  If ssuu is executed by root, no password is
     requested and a shell with the appropriate user ID is executed; no addi-
     tional Kerberos tickets are obtained.

     Alternately, if the user enters the password "s/key", they will be au-
     thenticated using the S/Key one-time password system as described in
     skey(1).  S/Key is a Trademark of Bellcore.

     By default, the environment is unmodified with the exception of USER,
     HOME, and SHELL. HOME and SHELL are set to the target login's default
     values.  USER is set to the target login, unless the target login has a
     user ID of 0, in which case it is unmodified.  The invoked shell is the
     target login's.  This is the traditional behavior of ssuu.

     The options are as follows:

     --KK      Do not attempt to use Kerberos to authenticate the user.

     --ff      If the invoked shell is csh(1),  this option prevents it from
             reading the ``_._c_s_h_r_c'' file.

     --ll      Simulate a full login.  The environment is discarded except for
             HOME, SHELL, PATH, TERM, and USER. HOME and SHELL are modified as
             above.  USER is set to the target login.  PATH is set to
             ``_/_b_i_n_:_/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n''. TERM is imported from your current environ-
             ment.  The invoked shell is the target login's, and ssuu will
             change directory to the target login's home directory.

     --mm      Leave the environment unmodified.  The invoked shell is your lo-
             gin shell, and no directory changes are made.  As a security pre-
             caution, if the target user's shell is a non-standard shell (as
             defined by getusershell(3))  and the caller's real uid is non-ze-
             ro, ssuu will fail.

     --ii      If the kerberos root instance is not root any other value can be
             passed using this switch.

     The --ll and --mm options are mutually exclusive; the last one specified
     overrides any previous ones.

     Only users mentioned in ``_~_r_o_o_t_/_._k_l_o_g_i_n'' (or in group 0 when not doing
     kerberos) can ssuu to ``root''.

     By default (unless the prompt is reset by a startup file) the super-user
     prompt is set to ``##'' to remind one of its awesome power.

     Environment variables used by ssuu:

     HOME  Default home directory of real user ID unless modified as specified
           above.

     PATH  Default search path of real user ID unless modified as specified
           above.

     TERM  Provides terminal type which may be retained for the substituted
           user ID.

     USER  The user ID is always the effective ID (the target user ID) after
           an ssuu unless the user ID is 0 (root).

     A ssuu command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.  The version described here
     is an adaptation of the MIT Athena Kerberos command.
