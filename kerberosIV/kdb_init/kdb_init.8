.SH NAME
kdb_init \- Initialize Kerberos key distribution center database
.SH SYNOPSIS
kdb_init [ 
.B realm
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I kdb_init
initializes a Kerberos key distribution center database, creating the
necessary principals.

prompts for a realm name (defaulting to the definition in /usr/include/kerberosIV/krb.h).
After determining the realm to be created, it prompts for
a master key password.  The master key password is used to encrypt
every encryption key stored in the database.
