.Sh NAME
.Nm pfctl
.Nd control the packet filter and NAT subsystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
.Op Fl d

.Op Fl F Ar modifier
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl l Ar interface
.Op Fl N Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl R Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar modifier

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility communicates with the packet filter system using the
ioctl interface described in
.Xr pf 4 .
.Pp
Packet filtering lets you restrict packets entering or leaving
your host; packets can be specified in a variety of ways including
by protocol, by port number, and by address.
Network Address Translation lets you map a series of internal
host IP numbers to a single external address.
The NAT code also has provision for redirecting a
range of connections to a different host and/or port number.
Taken together this provides a powerful basic firewall mechanism.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command is normally invoked automatically at system initialization
time to start and load the packet filter,
but can also be used when the filter or translation rules change.
.Pp
.Nm
requires the
.Xr pf 4
pseudo-device driver.
Forwarding packets, by using NAT, also requires specifying
.Li net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
in the file
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility provides several commands:
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Disable the packet filter
.It Fl e
Enable the packet filter
.It Fl F Ar modifier
Flush one of the following sets:
.Bl -tag -width "F n" -compact
.It Fl F Ar n
Flush the NAT rules
.It Fl F Ar r
Flush the filter rules
.It Fl F Ar s
Flush the state table (NAT and filter)
.It Fl F Ar S
Flush (zero) the filter statistics
.El
.It Fl h
Help
.It Fl l Ar interface
Enable collection of packet and byte count statistics for interface named
.Ar interface .
These statistics can be viewed with the
.Fl "sS"
flag.
.It Fl n
Do not actually load rules
.It Fl N Ar file
Load a NAT rules file
.It Fl R Ar file
Load a filter rules file into the filter
.It Fl s Ar modifier
Show filter parameters.
.Bl -tag -width "s n" -compact
.It Fl s Ar n
Show the currently loaded NAT rules
.It Fl s Ar r
Show the currently loaded packet filter rules
.It Fl s Ar s
Show the contents of the state table
.It Fl s Ar S
Show filter statistics
.El
.It Fl v
Show rules as they are parsed
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/nat.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/pf.conf
packet filter rules file
.It Pa /etc/nat.conf
rules for Network Address Translation

.Xr pf.conf 5 ,
.Xr nat.conf 5 .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
This mechanism is largely compatible with the previous
IP Filter mechanism, which was removed from
.Ox
due to a licensing conflict.
.Sh AUTHORS
Daniel Hartmeier wrote the program and the underlying mechanism.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program and the 
.Xr pf 4
filter mechanism first appeared in
.Ox 2.9 .
.Sh BUGS
Probably.
.Sh CAVEATS
It is not yet as fully featured as the mechanism it replaced.
