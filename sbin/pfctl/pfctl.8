.Sh NAME
.Nm pfctl
.Nd control the packet filter and NAT subsystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl c Ar set
.Op Fl l Ar interface
.Op Fl n Ar file
.Op Fl r Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar set
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility communicates with the packet filter system using the
ioctl interface described in
.Xr pf 4 .
.Pp
Packet filtering lets you restrict packets entering or leaving
your host; packets can be specified in a variety of ways including
by protocol, by port number, and by address.
Network Address Translation lets you map a series of internal
host IP numbers to a single external address.
The NAT code also has provision for redirecting a
range of connections to a different host and/or port number.
Taken together this provides a powerful basic firewall mechanism.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command is normally invoked automatically at system initialization
time to start and load the packet filter,
but can also be used when the filter or translation rules change.
.Pp
.Nm
requires a kernel with
.Xr pf 4
configured in (the GENERIC kernel qualifies).
To forward packets (using NAT), 
.Nm
also requires
.Li net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
in the file
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf .
.\"The existance of the variables PF and NAT in 
.\".Pa /etc/rc.conf
.\"determine whether this mechanism will be started automatically
.\"when the system is booted.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility provides several commands:
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Disable the packet filter
.It Fl e
Enable the packet filter
.It Fl c Ar set
Clear one of the following sets:
.Bl -tag -width "states" -compact
.It Ar nat
Clear the NAT rules
.It Ar rules
Clear the filter rules
.It Ar states
Clear the state table (NAT and filter)
.El
.It Fl l Ar interface
Enable logging for interface named
.Ar interface
.It Fl n Ar file
Load a NAT rules file
.It Fl r Ar file
Load a filter rules file into the filter
.It Fl s Ar set
Show filter parameters.
.Ar set
is one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "status" -compact
.It Ar nat
Show the currently loaded NAT rules
.It Ar rules
Show the currently loaded packet filter rules
.It Ar states
Show the contents of the state table
.It Ar status
Show filter statistics
.El
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/nat.rules -compact
.It Pa /etc/pf.rules
packet filter rules file
.It Pa /etc/nat.rules
rules for Network Address Translation

.Xr pf 4 , 
.Xr pf.rules 5 ,
.Xr nat.rules 5 .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
This mechanism is largely compatible with the previous
IP Filter mechanism, which was removed from
.Ox
due to a licensing conflict.
.Sh AUTHORS
Daniel Hartmeier wrote the program and the underlying mechanism.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program and the 
.Xr pf 4
filter mechanism first appeared in
.Ox 2.9 .
.Sh BUGS
Probably.
.Sh CAVEATS
It is not yet as fully featured as the mechanism it replaced.
