.Dt DHCLIENT.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhclient.conf
.Nd DHCP client configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains configuration information for
.Xr dhclient 8 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
file is a free-form ASCII text file.
It is parsed by the recursive-descent parser built into
.Xr dhclient 8 .
The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.
Keywords in the file are case-insensitive.
Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except within quotes).
Comments begin with the
.Sq #
character and end at the end of the line.
.Pp
The
.Nm
file can be used to configure the behaviour of the client in a wide variety
of ways: protocol timing, information requested from the server, information
required of the server, defaults to use if the server does not provide
certain information, values with which to override information provided by
the server, or values to prepend or append to information provided by the
server.
The configuration file can also be preinitialized with addresses to
use on networks that don't have DHCP servers.
.Sh PROTOCOL TIMING
The timing behaviour of the client need not be configured by the user.
If no timing configuration is provided by the user, a fairly
reasonable timing behaviour will be used by default \- one which
results in fairly timely updates without placing an inordinate load on
the server.
.Pp
The following statements can be used to adjust the timing behaviour of
the DHCP client if required, however:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic timeout Ar time ;
The
.Ic timeout
statement determines the amount of time that must pass between the
time that the client begins to try to determine its address and the
time that it decides that it's not going to be able to contact a server.
By default, this timeout is sixty seconds.
After the timeout has passed, if there are any static leases defined in the
configuration file, or any leases remaining in the lease database that
have not yet expired, the client will loop through these leases
attempting to validate them, and if it finds one that appears to be
valid, it will use that lease's address.
If there are no valid static leases or unexpired leases in the lease database,
the client will restart the protocol after the defined retry interval.
.It Ic retry Ar time ;
The
.Ic retry
statement determines the time that must pass after the client has
determined that there is no DHCP server present before it tries again
to contact a DHCP server.
By default, this is five minutes.
.It Ic select-timeout Ar time ;
It is possible (some might say desirable) for there to be more than
one DHCP server serving any given network.
In this case, it is possible that a client may be sent more than one offer
in response to its initial lease discovery message.
It may be that one of these offers is preferable to the other
(e.g., one offer may have the address the client previously used,
and the other may not).
.Pp
The
.Ic select-timeout
is the time after the client sends its first lease discovery request
at which it stops waiting for offers from servers, assuming that it
has received at least one such offer.
If no offers have been received by the time the
.Ic select-timeout
has expired, the client will accept the first offer that arrives.
.Pp
By default, the
.Ic select-timeout
is zero seconds \- that is, the client will take the first offer it sees.
.It Ic reboot Ar time ;
When the client is restarted, it first tries to reacquire the last
address it had.
This is called the INIT-REBOOT state.
If it is still attached to the same network it was attached to when it last
ran, this is the quickest way to get started.
The
.Ic reboot
statement sets the time that must elapse after the client first tries
to reacquire its old address before it gives up and tries to discover
a new address.
.Pp
The value of
.Ic reboot
is also used to control how long a client will attempt unicast renewal
requests before falling back to using broadcast requests.
.Pp
By default, the reboot timeout is one second.
.It Ic backoff-cutoff Ar time ;
The client uses an exponential backoff algorithm with some randomness,
so that if many clients try to configure themselves at the same time,
they will not make their requests in lockstep.
The
.Ic backoff-cutoff
statement determines the maximum amount of time that the client is
allowed to back off.
It defaults to fifteen seconds.
.It Ic initial-interval Ar time ;
The
.Ic initial-interval
statement sets the amount of time between the first attempt to reach a
server and the second attempt to reach a server.
Each time a message is sent, the interval between messages is incremented by
twice the current interval multiplied by a random number between zero and one.
If it is greater than the backoff-cutoff amount, it is set to that
amount.
It defaults to three seconds.
.It Ic link-timeout Ar time ;
The
.Ic link-timeout
statement sets the amount of time to wait for an interface link before timing
out.
The default value is ten seconds.
The value zero requests that
dhclient not wait for a link state change before timing out.
.El
.Sh LEASE REQUIREMENTS AND REQUESTS
The DHCP protocol allows the client to request that the server send it
specific information, and not send it other information that it is not
prepared to accept.
The protocol also allows the client to reject offers from servers if they
don't contain information the client needs, or if the information provided
is not satisfactory.
.Pp
There is a variety of data contained in offers that DHCP servers send
to DHCP clients.
The data that can be specifically requested is what are called
.Em DHCP Options .
DHCP Options are defined in
.Xr dhcp-options 5 .
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic ignore Op Ar option , ... ;
The
.Ic ignore
statement causes the client to discard values provided by the server for
the specified options.
Only option names should be specified in the ignore statement \- not
option values.
Only the last
.Ic ignore
statement has any effect, overriding any previous
.Ic ignore
statement.
.It Ic request Op Ar option , ... ;
The
.Ic request
statement causes the client to request that any server responding to the
client send the client its values for the specified options.
Only option names should be specified in the request statement \- not
option values.
Only the last
.Ic request
statement has any effect, overriding any previous
.Ic request
statement.
.It Ic require Op Ar option , ... ;
The
.Ic require
statement lists options that must be sent in order for an offer to be accepted.
Offers that do not contain all the listed options will be ignored.
Only option names should be specified in the require statement \- not
option values.
Only the last
.Ic require
statement has any effect, overriding any previous
.Ic require
statement.
.It Ic send Ar option option-value ;
The
.Ic send
statement causes the client to send the specified option and value
to the server.
Options that are always sent in the DHCP protocol should not be specified
here.
One use for this statement is to send information to the server
that will allow it to differentiate between this client and other
clients or kinds of clients.
.El
.Sh OPTION MODIFIERS
Options in the lease can be modified before being accepted.
.Pp
Several option modifiers are available.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic default Ar option option-value ;
Use
.Ar option-value
for the given
.Ar option ,
if no value is supplied by the server.
.It Ic supersede Ar option option-value ;
Use
.Ar option-value
for the given
.Ar option ,
regardless of the value supplied by the server.
.It Ic prepend Ar option option-value ;
Use
.Ar option-value
for the given
.Ar option ,
and then use the value supplied by the server.
.Ic prepend
can only be used for options which allow more than one value to be given.
The restriction is not enforced \- if violated, the results are unpredictable.
.It Ic append Ar option option-value ;
Use
.Ar option-value
for the given
.Ar option ,
after first using the value supplied by the server.
.Ic append
can only be used for options which allow more than one value to be given.
The restriction is not enforced \- if violated, the results are unpredictable.
.El
.Sh LEASE DECLARATIONS
The lease declaration:
.Pp
.D1 Ic lease No { Ar lease-declaration ; ... ; No }
.Pp
The DHCP client may decide after some period of time (see
.Sx PROTOCOL TIMING )
that it is not going to succeed in contacting a server.
At that time, it consults its own database of old leases and tests each one
that has not yet timed out by pinging the listed router for that lease to
see if that lease could work.
It is possible to define one or more
.Em fixed
leases in the client configuration file for networks where there is no DHCP
or BOOTP service, so that the client can still automatically configure its
address.
This is done with the
.Ic lease
statement.
.Pp
NOTE: the lease statement is also used in the
.Pa /var/db/dhclient.leases. Ns Aq Ar IFNAME
file in order to record leases that have been received from DHCP servers.
Some of the syntax for leases as described below is only needed in the
.Pa /var/db/dhclient.leases. Ns Aq Ar IFNAME
file.
Such syntax is documented here for completeness.
.Pp
A lease statement consists of the lease keyword, followed by a left
curly brace, followed by one or more lease declaration statements,
followed by a right curly brace.
The following lease declarations are possible:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic bootp ;
The
.Ic bootp
statement is used to indicate that the lease was acquired using the
BOOTP protocol rather than the DHCP protocol.
It is never necessary to specify this in the client configuration file.
The client uses this syntax in its lease database file.
.Pp
.It Ic interface Qq Ar string ;
The
.Ic interface
lease statement is used to indicate the interface on which the lease is valid.
If set, this lease will only be tried on a particular interface.
When the client receives a lease from a server, it always records the
interface number on which it received that lease.
If predefined leases are specified in the
.Nm
file, the interface should also be specified, although this is not required.
.Pp
.It Ic fixed-address Ar ip-address ;
The
.Ic fixed-address
statement is used to set the IP address of a particular lease.
This is required for all lease statements.
The IP address must be specified as a dotted quad (e.g., 12.34.56.78).
.Pp
.It Ic filename Qq Ar string ;
The
.Ic filename
statement specifies the name of the boot filename to use.
This is not used by the standard client, but is included for completeness.
.Pp
.It Ic server-name Qq Ar string ;
The
.Ic server-name
statement specifies the name of the boot server name to use.
This is not used by the standard client, but is included for completeness.
.Pp
.It Ic option Ar option option-value ;
The
.Ic option
statement is used to specify the value of an option supplied by the server,
or, in the case of predefined leases declared in
.Nm dhclient.conf ,
the value that the user wishes the client to use if the
predefined lease is used.
.Pp
.It Ic renew Ar date ;
.It Ic rebind Ar date ;
.It Ic expire Ar date ;
The
.Ic renew
statement defines the time at which the DHCP client should begin trying to
contact its server to renew a lease that it is using.
The
.Ic rebind
statement defines the time at which the DHCP client should begin to try to
contact
.Em any
DHCP server in order to renew its lease.
The
.Ic expire
statement defines the time at which the DHCP client must stop using a lease
if it has not been able to contact a server in order to renew it.
.El
.Pp
These declarations are automatically set in leases acquired by the
DHCP client, but must also be configured in predefined leases \- a
predefined lease whose expiry time has passed will not be used by the
DHCP client.
.Pp
Dates are specified as follows:
.Pp
.D1 <weekday> <year>/<month>/<day> <hour>:<minute>:<second>
.Pp
The weekday is present to make it easy for a human to tell when a
lease expires \- it's specified as a number from zero to six, with zero
being Sunday.
When declaring a predefined lease, it can always be specified as zero.
The year is specified with the century, so it should generally be four
digits except for really long leases.
The month is specified as a number starting with 1 for January.
The day of the month is likewise specified starting with 1.
The hour is a number between 0 and 23,
the minute a number between 0 and 59,
and the second also a number between 0 and 59.
.Sh OTHER DECLARATIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic reject Ar ip-address ;
The
.Ic reject
statement causes the DHCP client to reject offers from servers who use
the specified address as a server identifier.
This can be used to avoid being configured by rogue or misconfigured DHCP
servers, although it should be a last resort \- better to track down
the bad DHCP server and fix it.
.It Ic interface Qo Ar name Qc No { Ar declaration ; ... ; No }
A client with more than one network interface may require different
behaviour depending on which interface is being configured.
All timing parameters and declarations other than lease
declarations can be enclosed in an interface declaration, and those
parameters will then be used only for the interface that matches the
specified name.
Interfaces for which there is no interface declaration will use the
parameters declared outside of any interface declaration,
or the default settings.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following configuration file is used on a laptop
which has one interface, ep0 (a 3Com 3C589C).
Booting intervals have been shortened somewhat from the default, because
the client is known to spend most of its time on networks with little DHCP
activity.
The laptop does roam to multiple networks.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
timeout 60;
retry 60;
reboot 10;
select-timeout 5;
initial-interval 2;
reject 192.33.137.209;

interface "ep0" {
    send host-name "andare.fugue.com";
    send dhcp-client-identifier 1:0:a0:24:ab:fb:9c;
    send dhcp-lease-time 3600;
    supersede domain-name "fugue.com rc.vix.com home.vix.com";
    prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;
    request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
	    domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name;
    require subnet-mask, domain-name-servers;
}
.Ed
.Pp
This is a very complicated
.Nm
file \- in general, yours should be much simpler.
In many cases, it's sufficient to just create an empty
.Nm
file \- the defaults are usually fine.
