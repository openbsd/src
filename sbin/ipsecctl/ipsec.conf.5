.Sh NAME
.Nm ipsec.conf
.Nd IPsec configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ipsec 4
protocol suite provides security services for IP according to rules or
definitions specified in
.Nm .
.Sh FLOWS
IPsec uses
.Em flows
to determine whether to apply security services to an IP packet or not.
The following security services are available:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Ic flow esp
ESP can provide the following properties:
authentication, integrity, replay protection, and confidentiality of the data.
.It Ic flow ah
AH provides authentication, integrity, and replay protection, but no
confidentiality.
.El
.Pp
For details on ESP and AH see
.Xr ipsec 4 .
When no service is specified,
.Xr ipsecctl 8
will use ESP.
The settings for the security services have to be negotiated by
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
As soon as a packet matches a flow,
.Xr isakmpd 8
automatically starts the negotiation.
See
.Xr isakmpd 8
for details.
.Pp
Parameters specify the packets to which a flow applies.
Some parameters are optional.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Ar in No or Ar out
This rule applies to incoming or outgoing packets.
If neither
.Ar in
nor
.Ar out
are specified,
.Xr ipsecctl 8
will assume the direction
.Ar out
for this rule and will construct a proper
.Ar in
rule.
Thus packets in both directions will be matched.
.It Xo
.Ar from
.Aq Ar src
.Ar to
.Aq Ar dst
.Ar peer
.Aq Ar remote
.Xc
This rule applies for packets with source address
.Aq Ar src
and destination address
.Aq Ar dst .
All addresses are specified in CIDR notation.
The
.Ar peer
parameter specifies the address of the remote endpoint of this particular
flow.
For host-to-host connections where
.Aq Ar dst
is identical to
.Aq Ar remote ,
the
.Ar peer
specification can be left out.
.El
.Sh TCP MD5 SIGNATURES
RFC 2385 describes a mechanism to protect
.Xr tcp 4
sessions using MD5.
A Security Association (SA) for TCP MD5 signatures is set up using the
following rule:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Xo
.Ar tcpmd5
.Ar from
.Aq Ar src
.Ar to
.Aq Ar dst
.Ar spi
.Aq Ar number
.Ar authkey
.Aq Ar hex string
.Xc
This rule applies for packets with source address
.Aq Ar src
and destination address
.Aq Ar dst .
All addresses are specified in CIDR notation.
The parameter
.Ar spi
is a 32-bit value defining the Security Parameter Index (SPI) for this SA.
The authentication key to be used is a hexadecimal string of arbitrary length.
For both
.Ar spi
and
.Ar authkey
it is possible to specify two values separated by a colon.
.Xr ipsecctl 8
will then generate the matching incoming SA using the second values for
.Ar spi
and
.Ar authkey .
.El
.Pp
For details on how to enable TCP MD5 signatures see
.Xr tcp 4 .
