.Dt MOUNT_NTFS 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_ntfs
.Nd mount an NTFS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_ntfs
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Pa special
.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the NTFS filesystem residing on the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
NTFS file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The
.Ar special
device must correspond to a partition registered in the
.Xr disklabel 5 .
.Pp
The supported NTFS versions include both NTFS4, as used by Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0, and NTFS5, as used by Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Force behaviour to return MS-DOS 8.3 names also on
.Fn readdir .
.It Fl i
Make name lookup case insensitive for all names except POSIX names.
.It Fl u Ar uid
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
.El
.Sh FEATURES
.Ss NTFS file attributes
NTFS file attributes can be accessed in the following way:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
foo[[:ATTRTYPE]:ATTRNAME]
.Ed
.Pp
.Sq ATTRTYPE
is one of identifier listed in $AttrDef file of volume.
Default is $DATA.
.Sq ATTRNAME
is an attribute name.
Default is none.
.Pp
.Sy Examples :
.Pp
To get volume name (in Unicode):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cat /mnt/\e$Volume:\e$VOLUME_NAME
.Ed
.Pp
To read directory raw data:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cat /mnt/foodir:\e$INDEX_ROOT:\e$I30
.Ed
.Ss Limited support for writing
There is limited writing ability for files.
Limitations:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
file must be non-resident
.It
file must
.Em not
contain any holes (uninitialized areas)
.It
file can't be compressed
.El
.Pp
Note that it's not currently possible to create or remove files
on NTFS filesystems.
.Pp
.Sy Warning :
do not mount NTFS filesystems read-write.
The write support is not very useful and is not tested well.
It's not safe to write to any file on NTFS; you might damage the filesystem.
Unless you want to debug NTFS filesystem code, mount the NTFS filesystem
read-only.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr disklabel 5 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.\" .Xr mbrlabel 8 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh HISTORY
Support for NTFS first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
It was later ported to
.Ox
and first appeared in
.Ox 3.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
NTFS kernel implementation,
.Nm mount_ntfs ,
and this manual were originally written by
.An Semen Ustimenko Aq semenu@FreeBSD.org .
.Pp
The
.Ox
port was done by
.An Julien Bordet Aq zejames@greyhats.org .
.Sh BUGS
The write support should be enhanced to actually be able to change
file size, and to create and remove files and directories.
It's not very useful right now.
.Pp
If the attempt to mount NTFS gives you an error like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mount -t ntfs /dev/wd0k /mnt
mount_ntfs: /dev/wd0k on /mnt: Invalid argument
.Ed
.Pp
make sure that the appropriate partition has the correct entry in the
disk label, particularly that the partition offset is correct.
If the NTFS partition is the first partition on the disk, the
offset should be '63' on i386 (see
.Xr disklabel 8 ) .
.\" .Xr mbrlabel 8
.\" could help you to set up the disk label correctly.
.Pp
If the NTFS partition is marked as
.Ql dynamic
under Microsoft Windows XP,
it won't be possible to access it under
.Ox
anymore.
