.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the user-land control program for
.Xr raid 4 ,
the RAIDframe disk device.
.Nm
is primarily used to dynamically configure and unconfigure RAIDframe disk
devices.  For more information about the RAIDframe disk device, see
.Xr raid 4 .
.Pp
This document assumes the reader has at least rudimentary knowledge of
RAID and RAID concepts.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar component Ar dev
Add 
.Ar component
as a hot spare for the device 
.Ar dev .
.It Fl B Ar dev
Initiate a copyback of reconstructed data from a spare disk to 
it's original disk.  This is performed after a component has failed, 
and the failed drive has been reconstructed onto a spare drive.
.It Fl c Ar config_file Ar dev
Configure the RAIDframe device
.Ar dev
according to the configuration given in
.Ar config_file .
A description of the contents of
.Ar config_file
is given later.
.It Fl C Ar config_file Ar dev
As for
.Ar -c ,
but forces the configuration to take place.  This is required the
first time a RAID set is configured.
.It Fl f Ar component Ar dev
This marks the specified
.Ar component
as having failed, but does not initiate a reconstruction of that
component.
.It Fl F Ar component Ar dev
Fails the specified
.Ar component
of the device, and immediately begin a reconstruction of the failed
disk onto an available hot spare.  This is one of the mechanisms used to start
the reconstruction process if a component does have a hardware failure.
.It Fl g Ar component Ar dev
Get the component label for the specified component.
.It Fl i Ar dev
Initialize (re-write) the parity on the device.  This 
.Em must
be done before the RAID device is labeled and before
filesystems are created on the RAID device, and is normally used after
a system crash (and before a
.Xr fsck 8
) to ensure the integrity of the parity.
.It Fl I Ar serial_number Ar dev
Initialize the component labels on each component of the device.  
.Ar serial_number 
is used as one of the keys in determining whether a
particular set of components belong to the same RAID set.  While not
strictly enforced, different serial numbers should be used for
different RAID sets.
.It Fl p Ar dev
Check the status of the parity on the RAID set.  Displays a status
message, and returns successfully if the parity is up-to-date.
.It Fl P Ar dev
Check the status of the parity on the RAID set, and initialize
(re-write) the parity if the parity is not known to be up-to-date.
.It Fl r Ar component Ar dev
Remove the spare disk specified by 
.Ar component 
from the set of available spare components.
.It Fl R Ar component Ar dev
Fails the specified 
.Ar component , 
if necessary, and immediately begins a reconstruction back to 
.Ar component .
This is another mechanism for starting the reconstruction process if a
component has a hardware failure.
.It Fl s Ar dev
Display the status of the RAIDframe device for each of the components
and spares.
.It Fl S Ar dev
Check the status of component reconstruction.  The output indicates 
the amount of progress achieved in reconstructing a failed component.
.It Fl u Ar dev
Unconfigure the RAIDframe device.
.It Fl v 
Be more verbose.  For operations such as reconstructions, parity
re-writing, and copybacks, provide a progress indicator.
.El
.Pp
The device used by
.Nm
is specified by
.Ar dev .
.Ar dev
may be either the full name of the device (e.g.,
.Pa /dev/rraid0d
for the i386 architecture, and
.Pa /dev/rraid0c
for all others),
or just simply raid0 (for
.Pa /dev/rraid0d ) .
.Pp
The format of the configuration file is complex, and
only an abbreviated treatment is given here.  In the configuration
files, a
.Sq #
indicates the beginning of a comment.
.Pp
There are 4 required sections of a configuration file, and 2
optional components.  Each section begins with a
.Dq START ,
followed by
the section name, and the confuration parameters associated with that
section.  The first section is the
.Dq array
section, and it specifies
the number of rows, columns, and spare disks in the RAID array.  For
example:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
START array
1 3 0
.Ed
.Pp
indicates an array with 1 row, 3 columns, and 0 spare disks.  Note
that although multi-dimensional arrays may be specified, they are
.Em not
supported in the driver.
.Pp
The second section, the
.Dq disks
section, specifies the actual
components of the device.  For example:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
START disks
/dev/sd0e
/dev/sd1e
/dev/sd2e
.Ed
.Pp
specifies the three component disks to be used in the RAID device.  If
any of the specified drives cannot be found when the RAID device is
configured, then they will be marked as
.Dq failed ,
and the system will
operate in degraded mode.  Note that it is
.Em imperative
that the order of the components in the configuration file does not
change between configurations of a RAID device.  Changing the order
of the components (at least at the time of this writing) will result in
data loss.
.Pp
The next section,
.Dq spare ,
is optional, and if present specifies the devices to be used as
.Dq hot spares
-- devices
which are on-line, but are not actively used by the RAID driver unless
one of the main components fail.  A simple
.Dq spare
section might be:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
START spare
/dev/sd3e
.Ed
.Pp
for a configuration with a single spare component.  If no spare drives
are to be used in the configuration, then the
.Dq spare
section may be omitted.
.Pp
The next section is the
.Dq layout
section.  This section describes the
general layout parameters for the RAID device, and provides such
information as sectors per stripe unit, stripe units per parity unit,
stripe units per reconstruction unit, and the parity configuration to
use.  This section might look like:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
START layout
# sectPerSU SUsPerParityUnit SUsPerReconUnit RAID_level
32 1 1 5
.Ed
.Pp
The sectors per stripe unit specifies, in blocks, the interleave
factor; i.e., the number of contiguous sectors to be written to each
component for a single stripe.  Appropriate selection of this value
(32 in this example) is the subject of much research in RAID
architectures.  The stripe units per parity unit and
stripe units per reconstruction unit are normally each set to 1.
While certain values above 1 are permitted, a discussion of valid
values and the consequences of using anything other than 1 are outside
the scope of this document.  The last value in this section (5 in this
example) indicates the parity configuration desired.  Valid entries
include:
.Bl -tag -width inde
.It 0
RAID level 0.  No parity, only simple striping.
.It 1
RAID level 1.  Mirroring.
.It 4
RAID level 4.  Striping across components, with parity stored on the
last component.
.It 5
RAID level 5.  Striping across components, parity distributed across
all components.
.El
.Pp
There are other valid entries here, including those for Even-Odd
parity, RAID level 5 with rotated sparing, Chained declustering,
and Interleaved declustering, but as of this writing the code for
those parity operations has not been tested with
.Ox .
.Pp
The next required section is the
.Dq queue
section.  This is most often
specified as:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
START queue
fifo 1
.Ed
.Pp
where the queuing method is specified as FIFO (first-in, first-out),
and the size of the per-component queue is limited to 1 request.  A
value of 1 is quite conservative here, and values of 100 or more may
been used to increase the driver performance.
Other queuing methods may also be specified, but a discussion of them
is beyond the scope of this document.
.Pp
The final section, the
.Dq debug
section, is optional.  For more details
on this the reader is referred to the RAIDframe documentation
dissussed in the
.Sx HISTORY
section.
See
.Sx EXAMPLES
for a more complete configuration file example.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The examples in this section will focus on a RAID 5 configuration.
Other RAID configurations will behave similarly.  It is highly
recommended that before using the RAID driver for real filesystems
that the system administrator(s) have used
.Em all
of the options for
.Nm raidctl ,
and that they understand how the component reconstruction process
works.  While this example is not created as a tutorial, the steps
shown here can be easily duplicated using four equal-sized partitions
from any number of disks (including all four from a single disk).
.Pp
The primary uses of
.Nm
is to configure and unconfigure
.Xr raid 4
devices.  To configure a device, a configuration
file which looks something like:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
START array
# numRow numCol numSpare
1 3 1

START disks
/dev/sd1e
/dev/sd2e
/dev/sd3e

START spare
/dev/sd4e

START layout
# sectPerSU SUsPerParityUnit SUsPerReconUnit RAID_level_5
32 1 1 5

START queue
fifo 100
.Ed
.Pp
is first created.  In short, this configuration file specifies a RAID
5 configuration consisting of the disks
.Pa /dev/sd1e ,
.Pa /dev/sd2e ,
and
.Pa /dev/sd3e ,
with
.Pa /dev/sd4e
available as a
.Dq hot spare
in case one of
the three main drives should fail.  If the above configuration is in a
file called
.Pa rfconfig ,
raid device 0 in the normal case can be configured with: 
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -c rfconfig raid0
.Ed
.Pp
The above is equivalent to the following:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -c rfconfig /dev/rraid0d
.Ed
.Pp
on the i386 architecture.  On all other architectures,
.Pa /dev/rraid0c
is used in place of
.Pa /dev/rraid0d .
.Pp
A RAID set will not configure with 
.Fl c
if the component labels are not correct.  A
.Sq component label
contains important information about the component, including a
user-specified serial number, the row and column of that component in the RAID
set, and whether the data (and parity) on the component is 
.Sq clean .
See 
.Xr raid 4
for more information about component labels.
.Pp
Since new RAID sets will not have correct component labels, the first
configuration of a RAID set must use
.Fl C
instead of
.Fl c :
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -C rfconfig raid0
.Ed
.Pp
The 
.Fl C
forces the configuration to succeed, even if any of the component
labels are incorrect.  This option should not be used lightly in
situations other than initial configurations, as if
the system is refusing to configure a RAID set, there is probably a
very good reason for it.
.Pp
When the RAID set is configured for the first time, it is 
necessary to initialize the component labels, and to initialize the
parity on the RAID set.  Initializing the component labels is done with:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -I 112341 raid0
.Ed
.Pp
where 
.Sq 112341
is a user-specified serial number for the RAID set.  Using different
serial numbers between RAID sets is strongly encouraged, as using the
same serial number for all RAID sets will only serve to decrease the
usefulness of the component label checking.
.Pp
Initializing the parity on the RAID set is done via:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -i raid0
.Ed
.Pp
Initializing the parity in this way may also be required after an
unclean shutdown.  Once the parity is known to be correct, 
it is then safe to perform
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr newfs 8 ,
or
.Xr fsck 8
on the device or its filesystems, and then to mount the filesystems
for use.
.Pp
After the parity has been initialized for the first time, the command:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -p raid0
.Ed
.Pp
can be used to check the current status of the parity.  To check the
parity and rebuild it if necessary the command:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -P raid0
.Ed
.Pp
is used.  Note that re-writing the parity can be done while
other operations on the RAID set are taking place (e.g. while doing a
.Xr fsck 8
on a filesystem on the RAID set).  However: for maximum effectiveness
of the RAID set, the parity should be known to be correct before any
data on the set is modified.
.Pp
To see how the RAID set is doing, the following command can be used to
show the RAID set's status:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -s raid0
.Ed
.Pp
The output will look something like:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Components:
           /dev/sd1e: optimal
           /dev/sd2e: optimal
           /dev/sd3e: optimal
Spares:
           /dev/sd4e: spare
.Ed
.Pp
This indicates that all is well with the RAID set. 
.Pp
To check the component label of /dev/sd1e, the following is used:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -g /dev/sd1e raid0
.Ed
.Pp
The output of this command will look something like:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Component label for /dev/sd2e:
Version: 1
Serial Number: 112341
Mod counter: 6
Row: 0
Column: 1
Num Rows: 1
Num Columns: 3
Clean: 0
Status: optimal
.Ed
.Pp
For a component label to be considered valid, that particular
component label must be in agreement with the other component labels
in the set.  For example, the serial number, 'modification counter',
number of rows and number of columns must all be in agreement.  If any
of these are different, then the component is not considered to be
part of the set.
.Pp
If for some reason
(perhaps to test reconstruction) it is necessary to pretend a drive
has failed, the following will perform that function:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -f /dev/sd2e raid0
.Ed
.Pp
The system will then be performing all operations in degraded mode,
where missing data is re-computed from existing data and the parity.
In this case, obtaining the status of raid0 will return:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Components:
           /dev/sd1e: optimal
           /dev/sd2e: failed
           /dev/sd3e: optimal
Spares:
           /dev/sd4e: spare
.Ed
.Pp
Note that with the use of
.Fl f
a reconstruction has not been started.  To both fail the disk and
start a reconstruction, the
.Fl F
option must be used:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -F /dev/sd2e raid0
.Ed
.Pp
The 
.Fl f
option may be used first, and then the
.Fl F
option used later, on the same disk, if desired.
Immediately after the reconstruction is started, the status will report:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Components:
           /dev/sd1e: optimal
           /dev/sd2e: reconstructing
           /dev/sd3e: optimal
Spares:
           /dev/sd4e: used_spare
.Ed
.Pp
This indicates that a reconstruction is in progress.  To find out how
the reconstruction is progressing the
.Fl S
option may be used.  This will indicate the progress in terms of the
percentage of the reconstruction that is completed.  When the
reconstruction is finished the
.Fl s
option will show:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Components:
           /dev/sd1e: optimal
           /dev/sd2e: spared
           /dev/sd3e: optimal
Spares:
           /dev/sd4e: used_spare
.Ed
.Pp
At this point there are at least two options.  First, if
.Pa /dev/sd2e
is known to be good (i.e., the failure was either caused by
.Fl f
or
.Fl F ,
or the failed disk was replaced), then a copyback of the data can
be initiated with the
.Fl B
option.  In this example, this would copy the entire contents of
.Pa /dev/sd4e
to
.Pa /dev/sd2e .
Once the copyback procedure is complete, the status of the device would be:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Components:
           /dev/sd1e: optimal
           /dev/sd2e: optimal
           /dev/sd3e: optimal
Spares:
           /dev/sd4e: spare
.Ed
.Pp
and the system is back to normal operation.
.Pp
The second option after the reconstruction is to simply use
.Pa /dev/sd4e
in place of
.Pa /dev/sd2e
in the configuration file.  For example, the
configuration file (in part) might now look like:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
START array
1 3 0

START drives
/dev/sd1e
/dev/sd4e
/dev/sd3e
.Ed
.Pp
This can be done as
.Pa /dev/sd4e
is completely interchangeable with
.Pa /dev/sd2e
at this point.  Note that extreme care must be taken when
changing the order of the drives in a configuration.  This is one of
the few instances where the devices and/or their orderings can be
changed without loss of data!  In general, the ordering of components
in a configuration file should
.Em never
be changed.
.Pp
If a component fails and there are no hot spares
available on-line, the status of the RAID set might look like:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Components:
           /dev/sd1e: optimal
           /dev/sd2e: failed
           /dev/sd3e: optimal
No spares.
.Ed
.Pp
In this case there are a number of options.  The first option is to add a hot
spare using:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -a /dev/sd4e raid0
.Ed
.Pp
After the hot add, the status would then be:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Components:
           /dev/sd1e: optimal
           /dev/sd2e: failed
           /dev/sd3e: optimal
Spares:
           /dev/sd4e: spare
.Ed
.Pp
Reconstruction could then take place using 
.Fl F
as describe above.
.Pp
A second option is to rebuild directly onto
.Pa /dev/sd2e .
Once the disk 
containing 
.Pa /dev/sd2e
has been replaced, one can simply use:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -R /dev/sd2e raid0
.Ed
.Pp
to rebuild the 
.Pa /dev/sd2e
component.  As the rebuilding is in progress,
the status will be:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Components:
           /dev/sd1e: optimal
           /dev/sd2e: reconstructing
           /dev/sd3e: optimal
No spares.
.Ed
.Pp
and when completed, will be:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Components:
           /dev/sd1e: optimal
           /dev/sd2e: optimal
           /dev/sd3e: optimal
No spares.
.Ed
.Pp

.Pp
The final operation performed by
.Nm
is to unconfigure a
.Xr raid 4
device.  This is accomplished via a simple:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
raidctl -u raid0
.Ed
.Pp
at which point the device is ready to be reconfigured.
.Sh WARNINGS
Certain RAID levels (1, 4, 5, 6, and others) can protect against some
data loss due to component failure.  However the loss of two
components of a RAID 4 or 5 system, or the loss of a single component
of a RAID 0 system will result in the entire filesystem being lost.
RAID is
.Em not
a substitute for good backup practices.
.Pp
Recomputation of parity
.Em must
be performed whenever there is a chance that it may have been
compromised.  This includes after system crashes, or before a RAID
device has been used for the first time.  Failure to keep parity
correct will be catastrophic should a component ever fail -- it is
better to use RAID 0 and get the additional space and speed, than it
is to use parity, but not keep the parity correct.  At least with RAID
0 there is no perception of increased data security.
