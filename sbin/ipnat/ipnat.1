.Sh EXAMPLES
To use 
.Nm ipnat
with a dynamic ppp connection one can enable the address translation
in the 
.Pa /etc/ppp/ip-up 
script:
.Bd -literal
/sbin/ipnat -CF -f /etc/ipnat.rules
/sbin/ipf -E
.Ed
.Pp
To translate addresses from the internal 192.168.1.0/8 network
.Pa /etc/ipnat.rules 
should look like this:
.Bd -literal
map ppp0 192.168.1.0/8 -> 0/32 portmap tcp/udp 10000:20000
map ppp0 192.168.1.0/8 -> 0/32
