.Nm fdisk
.Nd partition table maintenance program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fdisk
.Op Fl egy
.Op Fl i | u
.Op Fl b Ar blocks
.Oo
.Fl c Ar cylinders
.Fl h Ar heads
.Fl s Ar sectors
.Oc
.Op Fl f Ar mbrfile
.Op Fl l Ar blocks
.Ar disk
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm fdisk
makes changes to the MBR and GPT tables found on some disks.
On such disks sector 0 contains a 4-entry MBR partition table
that divides the space.
The GPT partition table, when present, starts at sector 1.
.Pp
Each entry has a type.
A type of
.Ar 0xA6
indicates an
.Ox
MBR partition, which starts with its own
16-entry partition table known as a
.Xr disklabel 5 .
This can be edited using
.Xr disklabel 8 .
.Pp
Caution is advised when editing these tables, since some platforms
use tricks to boot and may rely on specific configurations created
at install time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar blocks
A special boot partition of the specified size will be written to disk
on architectures that need one.
Only valid with
.Fl i .
.It Xo
.Fl c Ar cylinders
.Fl h Ar heads
.Fl s Ar sectors
.Xc
Specifies an alternate BIOS geometry for
.Nm
to use.
By default, an automatic calculation of disk size will be built
using heuristics.
These figures are taken from the in-core disklabel
(see
.Xr disklabel 8 ) ,
or values that
.Em /boot
has passed to the kernel.
.Pp
Only one of
.Fl chs
or
.Fl l
can be specified.
.It Fl e
Use the
.Nm
interactive editor to modify the partition table.
See
.Sx COMMAND MODE ,
below, for more information.
.It Fl f Ar mbrfile
Specifies an alternate MBR template file.
The default file is
.Pa /usr/mdec/mbr .
.It Fl g
A protective MBR and a default GPT will be written to disk.
The default GPT will have a single
.Ox
partition containing all available space not allocated by a
.Fl b
specification.
Only valid with
.Fl i .
.It Fl i
Requests that the partition table data be re-initialized.
In this mode,
.Nm
will completely overwrite the primary MBR bootcode and MBR partition table.
.Pp
If
.Fl g
is not specified then the MBR will be overwritten by
the default MBR template
.Pa /usr/mdec/mbr
(or the one optionally specified by the
.Fl f
flag).
In the default template, MBR partition number 3 will be configured as an
.Ox
MBR partition containing all available space not allocated by a
.Fl b
specification.
.Pp
Only one of
.Fl i
or
.Fl u
can be specified.
.It Fl l Ar blocks
Specify the number of blocks in the disk, and force the MBR to be in LBA
mode only.
.Pp
Only one of
.Fl chs
or
.Fl l
can be specified.
.It Fl u
Update MBR bootcode, preserving existing MBR partition table.
The MBR bootcode extends from offset 0x000 to the start of the MBR partition
table at offset 0x1BE.
It is similar to the
.Fl i
flag, except the existing MBR partition table is preserved.
This is useful for writing new MBR bootcode onto an existing drive, and is
equivalent to the DOS command
.Dq FDISK /MBR .
Note that this option will overwrite the NT disk signature, if present.
.Pp
Only one of
.Fl i
or
.Fl u
can be specified.
.It Fl y
Avoid asking yes/no questions when not desirable.
.It Ar disk
Specify the
.Ar disk
to operate on.
It can be specified either by its full pathname or an abbreviated disk form.
In its abbreviated form, the path to the device, the
.Sq r
denoting
.Qq raw device ,
and the partition letter, can all be omitted.
For example, the first IDE disk can be specified as either
.Pa /dev/rwd0c ,
.Pa /dev/wd0c ,
or
.Ar wd0 .
.El
.Sh TYPICAL LAYOUT
When called with no special flags,
.Nm
prints the partition table of the specified disk.
.Pp
If the disk does not contain a valid GPT the contents
of the MBR are displayed.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 1n
# fdisk sd0
Disk: sd0       geometry: 121601/255/63 [1953525168 Sectors]

*3: A6 26108 1 1 - 121600 254 63 [ 419425083: 1534094982 ] OpenBSD
.Ed
.Pp
This 1953525168 sector (931GB) disk drive is divided into two MBR
partitions that span the whole disk.
The first MBR partition is a 200GB FAT-32 partition,
the second is a 731GB
.Ox
MBR partition using the remainder of the disk.
The fields of the output are:
.Bl -tag -width "start/size"
.It Em "#"
Number identifying each MBR partition table entry.
There are a total of four slots.
.Sq *
denotes the MBR partition which is declared bootable.
.It Em "id"
MBR partition type identifier.
.Ox
reserves the
magic number hexadecimal A6 (166 decimal).
.It Em "C/H/S"
These fields provide the starting and ending address of the MBR partition
in BIOS geometry.
.It Em "start/size"
These fields provide the starting sector and size in sectors of the
MBR partition in linear block addresses.
.El
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
The BIOS geometry sectors field (C/H/S) is
.Dq 1 based ,
but the LBA "start" field is
.Dq 0 based .
.Pp
The CHS values will need to be in the BIOS's geometry
for the system to be able to boot and use the drive correctly.
These values must be kept correctly synchronized or a variety of
problems develop which are very difficult to diagnose.
.Pp
If the disk contains a protective MBR and a valid GPT, the contents of the GPT
are displayed.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 1n
Disk: sd1 ca501b80-5b85-40fd-a00e-abc6ffc5f97c [7907328 Sectors]

.Ed
.Pp
This 7907328 sector disk drive is divided into two
partitions that span the whole disk.
The first partition is a 960 sector EFI Sys partition.
the second is a 7906241 sector
.Ox
partition using the remainder of the disk.
The fields of the output are:
.Bl -tag -width "uuid"
.It Em "#"
Number identifying each partition table entry.
.It Em "uuid"
The UUID of the partition.
.It Em "lba"
The sector the partition starts on.
.It Em "size"

The list of commands and their explanations are given below.
Commands may be abbreviated provided enough characters are given to ensure
unambiguity.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm ?\&
A synonym for
.Cm help .
.It Cm help
Display a list of commands that
.Nm
understands in the interactive edit mode.
.It Cm manual
Display this manual page.
.It Cm reinit Op Cm gpt | Cm mbr
Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of the
boot block.
If
.Cm gpt
is specified a protective MBR and a GPT are initialized.
If
.Cm mbr
is specified only an MBR is initialized.
If neither
.Cm mbr
nor
.Cm gpt
are specified then a protective MBR and a GPT are initialized if a protective
MBR already exists.
Otherwise only an MBR is initialized.
.It Cm disk
Display the current drive geometry that
.Nm
probed using kernel provided information and various heuristics.
The disk geometry may be changed at this point.
Not available when editing a GPT.
.It Cm edit Ar #
Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of
the current boot block.
Sizes may be adjusted in BIOS geometry mode (MBR only) or using
sector offsets and sizes.
A unit
.Sq b ,
.Sq k ,
.Sq m ,
or
.Sq g
may be appended to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes.
The special size value
.Sq *
will cause the partition to be sized to use the remainder of the disk.
.It Cm flag Ar # Op Ar value
Make the given MBR partition table entry bootable
and mark all others as not bootable
(only one entry can be marked bootable).
The bootable partition is denoted with
.Sq * .
.\" If you wish to boot from an extended
.\" MBR partition, you will need to mark the MBR partition table entry for the
.\" extended MBR partition as bootable.
If a
.Ar value
of 0 is given,
the MBR partition is marked as not bootable,
but no other MBR partitions are touched.
.It Cm update
Update the machine MBR bootcode and 0xAA55 signature in the memory copy
of the currently selected MBR.
Note that this option will overwrite an NT disk
signature, if present.
Not available when editing a GPT.
.It Cm select Ar #
Select and load into memory the MBR pointed
to by the extended MBR partition table entry in the current boot block.
Not available when editing a GPT.
.It Cm setpid Ar #
Change the partition
identifier of the given partition table entry.
This command is particularly useful for reassigning
an existing partition to
.Ox .
.It Cm swap Ar # Ar #
Swap two partition entries.
.It Cm print Op Ar unit
Print the currently selected in-memory copy of the
partition table to the terminal.
A
.Ar unit
.Sq b ,

Hand crafted disk layouts are highly error prone.
It is common practice,
though by no means required,
that MBR partitions start on a cylinder boundary
(generally head 0, sector 1, but head 1, sector 1 for track 0),
and that MBR partitions also end at cylinder boundaries.
