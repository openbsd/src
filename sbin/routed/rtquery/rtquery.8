.Dt RTQUERY 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rtquery
.Nd query routing daemons for their routing tables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rtquery
.Op Fl 1np
.Op Fl r Ar addr
.Op Fl t Ar op
.Op Fl w Ar timeout
.Ar host ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to query a RIPv1/2 network routing daemon
for its routing table by sending a
.Em request
command.
The routing information in any routing
.Em response
packets returned is displayed numerically and symbolically.
.Nm
is also used to turn tracing on or off.
.Pp
See
.Xr routed 8
for more information about a RIPv1/2 capable routing daemon.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 1
Query using RIP version 1 instead of RIP version 2.
.It Fl n
Normally network and host numbers are displayed both symbolically
and numerically.
The
.Fl n
option displays only the numeric network and host numbers.
.It Fl p
Uses the
.Em poll
command to request full routing information,
instead of the default
.Em request
command.
.It Fl r Ar addr
Ask about the route to destination
.Ar addr .
.It Fl t Ar op
Change tracing, where
.Ar op
is one of the following.
Requests from processes not running with UID 0 or on distant networks
are generally ignored by the daemon except for a message in the system log.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Ic dump
Dumps the daemon's routing table to the current tracefile.
.It Ic more
Increases the debugging level.
.It Ic off
Turns off tracing.
.It Ic on Ns = Ns Ar tracefile
Turn tracing on into the specified file.
That file must usually
have been specified when the daemon was started or be the same
as a fixed name, often
.Pa /etc/routed.trace .
.El
.It Fl w Ar timeout
Changes the delay for an answer from each host.
By default, each host is given 15 seconds to respond.
