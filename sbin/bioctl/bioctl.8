.Sh DESCRIPTION
RAID device drivers which support management functionality can
register their services with the
.Xr bio 4
driver.
.Nm bioctl
then can be used to maintain RAID volumes.
.Pp
In the first synopsis,
RAID controllers are managed.
.Ar device
specifies either a drive (e.g. sd0) or a RAID controller (e.g. ami0).
For operations which will be performed against
.Xr ses 4
or
.Xr safte 4
enclosures, it is also possible to directly specify the enclosure name
(e.g. safte0).
.Pp
In the second synopsis,
.Xr softraid 4
devices are managed.
.Ar device
specifies either a drive (e.g. sd0) or a
.Xr softraid 4
device (e.g. softraid0).
.Pp
The options for RAID controllers are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar alarm-function
Control the RAID card's alarm functionality, if supported.
.Ar alarm-function
may be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable -compact
.It Cm disable
Disable the alarm on the RAID controller.
.It Cm enable
Enable the alarm on the RAID controller.
.It Cm get
Retrieve the current alarm state (enabled or disabled).
.It Cm silence | quiet
Silence the alarm if it is currently beeping.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar alarm-function
may be specified as given above,
or by the first letter only
(e.g. -a e).
.It Fl b Ar channel : Ns Ar target Ns Op Pf . Ar lun
Instruct the device at
.Ar channel : Ns Ar target Ns Op Pf . Ar lun
to start blinking, if there is
.Xr ses 4
or
.Xr safte 4
support in the enclosure.
.It Fl H Ar channel : Ns Ar target Ns Op Pf . Ar lun
If the device at
.Ar channel : Ns Ar target Ns Op Pf . Ar lun
is currently marked
.Dq Unused ,
promote it to being a
.Dq Hot Spare .
.It Fl h
Where necessary, produce
.Dq human-readable
output.
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, Exabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to four or less.
.It Fl i
Enumerate the selected RAID devices.
This is the default if no other option is given.
.It Fl q
Show vendor, product, revision, and serial number for the given disk.
.It Fl R Ar device | channel : Ns Ar target Ns Op Pf . Ar lun
Manually kick off a rebuild of a RAID volume, using
.Ar device
or
.Ar channel : Ns Ar target Ns Op Pf . Ar lun
as a new chunk (with
.Xr softraid 4 ,
a partition of fstype
.Dq RAID )
in the volume.
.Ar device
must be specified as a full path to the chunk device file (e.g. /dev/wd0d).
A RAID volume rather than a RAID controller is expected as the final argument.
.It Fl t Ar patrol-function
Control the RAID card's patrol functionality, if supported.
.Ar patrol-function
may be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable -compact
.It Cm stop
Stop the patrol on the RAID controller.
.It Cm start
Start the patrol on the RAID controller.
.It Cm get
Retrieve the current patrol configuration.
.It Cm disable
Disable the patrol functionality.
.It Cm manual
Enable the patrol functionality to start/stop manually.
.It Cm auto Ns Op Pf . Ar interval Ns Op Pf . Ar start
Enable the patrol functionality to start/stop automatically in every
.Ar interval
seconds, starting the first iteration after
.Ar start
seconds.
.El
.It Fl u Ar channel : Ns Ar target Ns Op Pf . Ar lun
Instruct the device at
.Ar channel : Ns Ar target Ns Op Pf . Ar lun
to cease blinking, if there is
.Xr ses 4
or
.Xr safte 4
support in the enclosure.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose in output.
.El
.Pp
In addition to the relevant options listed above,
the options for
.Xr softraid 4
devices are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C Ar flag Ns Op Pf , Ar flag Ns Op Pf , Ar ...
Pass
.Ar flag
to
.Nm .
May be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable -compact
.It Cm force
Force the operation;
for example, force the creation of volumes
with unclean data in the metadata areas.
.It Cm noauto
Do not automatically assemble this volume at boot time.
.El
.It Fl c Ar raidlevel
Create a
.Xr softraid 4
device of level
.Ar raidlevel .
The device must begin with
.Dq softraid
followed by a number.
.Pp
Valid raidlevels are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 2n -offset 3n -compact
.It Cm 0
RAID 0:
A striping discipline.
.It Cm 1
RAID 1:
A mirroring discipline.
.It Cm 5
RAID 5:
A striping discipline with floating parity chunk.
.It Cm C
CRYPTO:
An encrypting discipline.
.It Cm c
CONCAT:
A concatenating discipline.
.El
.Pp
The RAID 0, RAID 1 and CONCAT disciplines require a minimum of two devices to
be provided via
.Fl l .
RAID 5 requires at least three devices
and the CRYPTO discipline requires exactly one.
.It Fl d
Detach volume specified by device.
.It Fl k Ar keydisk
Use special device
.Ar keydisk
as a key disk for a crypto volume.
.It Fl l Ar special Ns Op Pf , Ar special Ns Op Pf , Ar ...
Use
.Ar special
device list to create within the
.Xr softraid 4
framework.
Requires
.Fl c .
.It Fl O Ar device | channel : Ns Ar target Ns Op Pf . Ar lun
Set the state of
.Ar device
or
.Ar channel : Ns Ar target Ns Op Pf . Ar lun
to offline.
The state of the RAID volume will change in the same way that it would if the
disk physically went offline.
.Ar device
must be specified as a full path to the chunk device file (e.g. /dev/wd0d).
A RAID volume rather than a RAID controller is expected as the final argument.
.It Fl P
Change the passphrase on the selected crypto volume.
.It Fl p Ar passfile
Passphrase file used when crypto volumes are brought up.
This file must be root owned and have 0600 permissions.
.It Fl r Ar rounds
The number of iterations for the KDF algorithm to use when converting a
passphrase into a key, in order to create a new encrypted volume or change the
passphrase of an existing encrypted volume.
A larger number of iterations takes more time, but offers increased resistance
against passphrase guessing attacks.
If
.Ar rounds
is specified as "auto", the number of rounds will be automatically determined
based on system performance.
Otherwise the minimum is 4 rounds and the default is 16.
.It Fl s
Read the passphrase for the selected crypto volume from
.Pa /dev/stdin
rather than
.Pa /dev/tty .
This option cannot be used during the initial creation of the crypto volume.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configure softraid0 with 4 special devices
(/dev/sd2e, /dev/sd3e, /dev/sd4e, /dev/sd5e)
and a RAID level of 1:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# bioctl -c 1 -l /dev/sd2e,/dev/sd3e,/dev/sd4e,/dev/sd5e softraid0
.Ed
.Pp
Configure softraid0 with one special device (/dev/sd2e) and an encrypting
volume:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# bioctl -c C -l /dev/sd2e softraid0
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
will ask for a passphrase, which will be needed to unlock the encrypted
disk.
After creating a newly encrypted disk, the first megabyte of it should be
zeroed, so tools like
.Xr fdisk 8
or
.Xr disklabel 8
don't get confused by the random data that appears on the new disk:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd3c bs=1m count=1
.Ed
.Pp
Detaching a softraid volume requires the exact volume name.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# bioctl -d sd2
.Ed
.Pp
Start a rebuild of the degraded softraid volume sd0
using a new chunk on wd0d:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# bioctl -R /dev/wd0d sd0
.Ed
