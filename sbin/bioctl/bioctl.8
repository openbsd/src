.Sh DESCRIPTION
RAID device drivers which support management functionality can
register their services with the
.Xr bio 4
driver.
.Nm bioctl
then can be used to maintain RAID volumes.
.Pp
In the first synopsis,
RAID controllers are managed.
.Ar device
specifies either a drive (e.g. sd0) or a RAID controller (e.g. ami0).
For operations which will be performed against
.Xr ses 4
or
.Xr safte 4
enclosures, it is also possible to directly specify the enclosure name
(e.g. safte0).
.Pp
In the second synopsis,
.Xr softraid 4
devices are managed.
.Ar device
specifies either a drive (e.g. sd0) or a
.Xr softraid 4
device (e.g. softraid0).
.Pp
The options for RAID controllers are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar alarm-function
Control the RAID card's alarm functionality, if supported.
.Ar alarm-function
may be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable -compact
.It Ar disable
Disable the alarm on the RAID controller.
.It Ar enable
Enable the alarm on the RAID controller.
.It Ar get
Retrieve the current alarm state (enabled or disabled).
.It Ar silence | Ar quiet
Silence the alarm if it is currently beeping.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar alarm-function
may be specified as given above,
or by the first letter only
(e.g. -a e).
.It Fl b Ar channel:target[.lun]
Instruct the device at
.Ar channel:target[.lun]
to start blinking, if there is
.Xr ses 4
or
.Xr safte 4
support in the enclosure.
.It Fl H Ar channel:target[.lun]
If the device at
.Ar channel:target[.lun]
is currently marked
.Dq Unused ,
promote it to being a
.Dq Hot Spare .
.It Fl h
Where necessary, produce
.Dq human-readable
output.
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, Exabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to four or less.
.It Fl i
Enumerate the selected RAID devices.
This is the default if no other option is given.
.It Fl q
Show vendor, product, revision, and serial number for the given disk.
.It Fl R Ar device \*(Ba channel:target[.lun]
Manually kick off a rebuild of a RAID volume, using
.Ar device
or
.Ar channel:target[.lun]
as a new chunk (with
.Xr softraid 4 ,
a partition of fstype
.Dq RAID )
in the volume.
.Ar device
must be specified as a full path to the chunk device file (e.g. /dev/wd0d).
A RAID volume rather than a RAID controller is expected as the
final argument.
.It Fl u Ar channel:target[.lun]
Instruct the device at
.Ar channel:target[.lun]
to cease blinking, if there is
.Xr ses 4
or
.Xr safte 4
support in the enclosure.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose in output.
.El
.Pp
In addition to the relevant options listed above,
the options for
.Xr softraid 4
devices are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C Ar flag[,flag,...]
Pass
.Ar flag
to
.Nm .
May be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable -compact
.It Ar force
Force the operation;
for example, force the creation of volumes
with unclean data in the metadata areas.
.It Ar noauto
Do not automatically assemble this volume at boot time.
.El
.It Fl c Ar raidlevel
Create a
.Xr softraid 4
device of level
.Ar raidlevel .
The device must begin with
.Dq softraid
followed by a number.
.Pp
Valid raidlevels are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It 0
RAID 0:
A striping discipline.
.It 1
RAID 1:
A mirroring discipline.
.It 4
RAID 4:
A striping discipline with fixed parity chunk.
.It 5
RAID 5:
A striping discipline with floating parity chunk.
.It C
CRYPTO:
An encrypting discipline.
.El
.Pp
The RAID 0 and RAID 1 disciplines requires a minimum of two devices passed to
.Fl l ,
RAID 4 and RAID 5 require at least three devices,
and the CRYPTO discipline requires exactly one.
.It Fl d
Delete volume specified by device.
.It Fl k Ar keydisk
Use special device
.Ar keydisk
as a key disk for a crypto volume.
.It Fl l Ar special[,special,...]
Use
.Ar special
device list to create within the
.Xr softraid 4
framework.
Requires
.Fl c .
.It Fl P
Change the passphrase on the selected crypto volume.
.It Fl p Ar passfile
Passphrase file used when crypto volumes are brought up.
This file must be root owned and have 0600 permissions.
This option cannot be used during the initial creation of the crypto volume.
.It Fl r Ar rounds
When creating an encrypted volume, specifies the number of iterations of
the PBKDF2 algorithm used to convert a passphrase into a key.
Higher iteration counts take more time, but offer more resistance to key
guessing attacks.
The minimum is 1000 rounds and the default is 8192.
.It Fl s
Read the passphrase for the selected crypto volume from
.Pa /dev/stdin
rather than
.Pa /dev/tty .
This option cannot be used during the initial creation of the crypto volume.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command, executed from the command line, would configure
the device softraid0 with 4 special devices
(/dev/sd2e, /dev/sd3e, /dev/sd4e, /dev/sd5e) and
a raid level of 1:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# bioctl -c 1 -l /dev/sd2e,/dev/sd3e,/dev/sd4e,/dev/sd5e softraid0
.Ed
.Pp
The following command, executed from the command line, would configure the
device softraid0 with one special device (/dev/sd2e) and an encrypting
volume:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# bioctl -c C -l /dev/sd2e softraid0
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
will ask for a passphrase, which will be needed to unlock the encrypted
disk.
After creating a newly encrypted disk, the first megabyte of it should be
zeroed, so tools like
.Xr fdisk 8
or
.Xr disklabel 8
don't get confused by the random data that appears on the new disk.
This can be done with the following command (assuming the new disk is sd3):
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd3c bs=1m count=1
.Ed
.Pp
Deleting a softraid volume requires the exact volume name.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# bioctl -d sd2
.Ed
.Pp
The following command starts a rebuild of the degraded softraid volume sd0
using a new chunk on wd0d:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# bioctl -R /dev/wd0d sd0
.Ed
