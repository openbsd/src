.Dt PHOTURISD 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm photurisd
.Nd IPSec key management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm photurisd
.Op Fl ci
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm photuris
daemon establisches security associations for encrypted
and/or authenticated network traffic. 
.Pp
The daemon listens to a named pipe 
.Pa photuris.pipe
for user requests and on a
.Nm PF_ENCAP
socket for kernel requests.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
The
.Fl c
option is used to force a primality check of the bootstrapped moduli.
.It Fl i
The
.Fl i
option can be used to ignore the 
.Pa photuris.startup
file. Otherwise the exchanges in that file will be initiated
on startup.
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option specifies the directory in which
.Nm photurisd
looks for its startup files. The default is
.Pa /etc/photuris/ .
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option specifies the local port the daemon shall bind to.
.El
.Pp
The file
.Pa photuris.conf
contains the moduli for the DH exchange and the actual exchange
schemes used to establish a shared secret. The following keywords are 
understood:
.Bl -tag -width exchange -offset indent
.It modulus
This keyword is followed by the numeric generator and modulus. Those two
values describe the group in which exchange values for the 
.Nm Diffie-Hellmann
key exchange are generated. The modulus needs to be a 
.Nm safe prime .
.It exchange
The supported exchange schemes are specified here with. The scheme is followed
either by zero or the number of bits of the modulus to be used with this 
scheme. If zero is specified the given scheme acts as modifier to the base 
scheme. The base scheme is
.Nm DH_G_2_MD5
(generator of two and MD5 identification). Extended schemes are
.Nm DH_G_2_DES_MD5
and
.Nm DH_G_2_3DES_SHA1 .
An exchange can only be configured if an apropriate modulus has be given
before.
.It config
This is used to configure the LifeTimes of SPIs and exchanges. The configurable
values are:
.Nm exchange_max_retries ,
.Nm exchange_retransmit_timeout ,
.Nm exchange_timeout ,
.Nm exchange_lifetime 
and
.Nm spi_lifetime .
They are followed by an integer.
.El
.Pp
The file
.Pa attributes.conf
contains the attributes, i.e. different choices of encryption
and authenication, offered to the other peer. If a line starts with an ip
address and a space seperated netmask the following attributes are only
offered to hosts lying in that net range. Only one attribute per line
is allowed. An attribute can either be an already defined tag or
an new definition of an attribute. In that case the line is followed by a 
comma separated list:
.Nm attribute name ,
.Nm Photuris id ,
.Nm type of attribute
and
.Nm key length .
The name is only used as reference. A list of possible Photuris ids can
be found in
.Pa /usr/share/ipsec/attributes.conf .
The attribute type is one of the following:
.Nm enc ,
.Nm ident ,
.Nm auth
or
.Nm ident|auth .
The key length is so far only used by the encryption attributes and
specifies the number of keying bytes the daemon has to generate.
Predefined attributes are:
.Bl -tag -width AT_ESP_ATTRIB -offset indent
.It AT_AH_ATTRIB
Starts the list of authentication attributes.
.It AT_ESP_ATTRIB
Starts the list of encryption attributes.
.El
.Pp
The file
.Pa secrets.conf
contains the party preconfigured symmetric secrets for the
identity exchange. 
.Bl -tag -width identity_pair_local -offset indent
.It identity local
Defines the identity the local daemon will assume and the according
password. Both name and secret are braced by quotation marks and follow
the 
.Nm identity local
directive.
.It identity remote
Defines the parties the daemon can communicate with and their secrets.
Both name and secret are braced by quotation marks and follow the
.Nm identity remote
directive. The name and secret are the same as the identity local
on the remote site.
.It identity pair local
If the identity of the remote site is already known,
.Nm identity pair local
enables the daemon to assume an identity and secret based on
the remote identity. The directive is followed by the
remote identity, a new local identity and an according secret.
In that way the secrets are not shared with all other parties.
.El
.Pp
Once DNSSEC or other public key infrastructures are available, those will
be supported also.
.Pp
Finally the file
.Pa photuris.startup
contains parameters for exchanges which are created during
startup.
.Pp
The keywords 
.Nm dst ,
.Nm port ,
.Nm options ,
.Nm tsrc ,
.Nm tdsr ,
.Nm exchange_lifetime ,
.Nm spi_lifetime
and
.Nm user
are understood in the 
.Pa photuris.startup
file. The values are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width exchange_lifetime -offset indent
.It dst
The destination IP address with which the exchange is to be established.
.It port
The port number of the destination
.Nm photuris
daemon.
.It options
The options to be used in the exchange. Possible values are
.Nm enc
and
.Nm auth .
.It tsrc
The source address with netmask from which packets are accepted
for the tunnel to be created.
.It tdst
The destination address with netmask for which packets are
accepted for the tunnel being created.
.It exchange_lifetime
Determines the lifetime of the exchange. After an exchange expires
no new SPIs are created.
.It spi_lifetime
Determines the lifetime of each created SPI in the exchange.
.It user
The user name for whom the keying shall be done. Preconfigured
secrets are taken from the users secret file.
.El
.Pp
Exchanges are separated by newlines.

.Sh EXAMPLE
A sample photuris.startup entry:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
dst=134.100.106.2 port=468 options=auth
tsrc=134.100.104.0/255.255.255.255
tdst=134.100.106.0/255.255.255.255

.Sh HISTORY
The photuris keymanagement protocol is described in the internet draft
.Nm draft-simpson-photuris 
by the authors Phil Karn and William Allen Simpson.
This implementation was done 1997 by Niels Provos and appeared in 
.Bx Open
2.1.
