.Ar idstmask
.Ar tproto
.Ar sport
.Ar dport
.Ar raddr
.Ar spi
.Ar fespah
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rt
utility creates a routing entry for IPSec. A Security association
must already be established with either
.Xr photurisd 8
or
.Xr ipsecadm 1 .
The arguments are: 
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width idstmask_
.It isrc
The initial source address.
.It isrcmask
The network mask for the initial source address. The source
address of outgoing packets has to match the address range
specified by 
.Nm isrc 
and 
.Nm isrcmask
to be routed through IPSec.
.It idst
The initial destination address.
.It idstmask
The network mask for the initial destination address. The destination
address of outgoing packets has to match the address range
specified by
.Nm idst 
and 
.Nm idstmask
to be routed through IPSec.
.It tproto
The protocol number packets have to match to be routed.
Specify -1 as wildcard.
.It sport
The source port of a packet if applicable. Specify -1 as wildcard.
.It dport
The destination port aof a packet if applicable. Specify -1 as wildcard.
.It raddr
The destination address of the security association. If you dont
use tunnel mode that will be the same as 
.Nm idst .
.It spi
The Security Parameter Index of the security association.
.It fespah
Specifies the security protocol of the SA. Use either 0 for AH or
1 for ESP.

.Sh EXAMPLE
Route packets for ESP in transport mode:
.Pp
rt 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 remote 255.255.255.255 -1 -1 -1 remote SPI 1
.Pp
rt localip 255.255.255.255 remote 255.255.255.255 -1 -1 -1 remote SPI 1
