.Sh NAME
.Nm ipsecadm
.Nd interface to setup IPSec
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ipsecadm
.Op command
.Ar modifiers ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ipsecadm
utility allows to setup security associations in the kernel
to be used with 
.Xr ipsec 4 .
It can be used to specify the encryption and authentication
algorithms and key material for the network layer security
provided by IPSec.
The possible commands are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width new_esp
.It new esp
Setup a SPI which uses the new esp transforms.
Encryption and authentication algorithms can be applied. 
This is the default mode.
Allowed
modifiers are:
.Fl dst ,
.Fl src ,
.Fl spi ,
.Fl tunnel ,
.Fl enc ,
.Fl auth ,
.Fl iv ,
.Fl newpadding ,
.Fl authkey ,
and
.Fl key .
.It old esp
Setup a SPI which uses the old esp transforms. Only
encryption algorithms can be applied. Allowed modifiers are:
.Fl dst ,
.Fl src ,
.Fl spi ,
.Fl tunnel ,
.Fl enc ,
.Fl iv 
and
.Fl key .
.It new ah
Setup a SPI which uses the new ah transforms. Authentication
will be done with HMAC using the specified hash algorithm. Allowed modifiers
are:
.Fl dst ,
.Fl src ,
.Fl spi ,
.Fl tunnel ,
.Fl auth ,
and
.Fl key .
.It old ah
Setup a SPI which uses the old ah transforms. Simple keyed
hashes will be used for authentication. Allowed modifiers are:
.Fl dst ,
.Fl src ,
.Fl spi ,
.Fl tunnel ,
.Fl auth ,
and
.Fl key .
.It delspi
The specified SA will be deleted. A SA consists of the
destination address, SPI and security protocol. Allowed modifiers are:
.Fl dst ,
.Fl spi ,
.Fl proto .
and
.Fl chain .
.It group
Group two SA's together. Allowed modifiers are:
.Fl dst ,
.Fl spi ,
.Fl proto ,
.Fl dst2 ,
.Fl spi2 ,
and
.Fl proto2 .
.El
.Pp
The modifiers have the following meanings: 
.Bl -tag -width newpadding -offset indent
.It src
The source IP address for the SPI.
.It dst
The destination IP address for the SPI.
.It spi
The unique Security Parameter Index (SPI).
.It tunnel
The source and destination IP addresses for the external IP header.
.It newpadding
For new ESP, specify new style self-describing padding should be used. Ignored everywhere else.
.It enc
The encryption algorithm to be used with the SPI. Possible values
are:
.Nm des 
and
.Nm 3des
for both old and new esp.
Blowfish encryption
.Nm blf
and
.Nm cast
can only be used with new esp.
.It auth
The authentication algorithm to be used with the SPI. Possible values
are:
.Nm md5
and
.Nm sha1
for both old and new ah and also new esp. Also
.Nm rmd160
for both new ah and esp.
.It key
The secret symmetric key used for encryption and authentication. The size
for 
.Nm des
and
.Nm 3des
is fixed to 8 and 24 respectivly. For other ciphers like
.Nm cast
or
.Nm blf
the key length can be variable.
.It authkey
The secret key material used for authentication 
if additional authentication in new esp mode is required. For
old or new ah the key material for authentication is passed with the
.Nm key
option.
.It iv
The initialization vector used for encryption. In old esp mode you need
to specify it as either four or eight byte long value. In new esp mode
the iv has to be eight bytes for
.Nm cast
and
.Nm blf .
The other transforms can either use an eight byte iv or will derive one 
when none is specified with
.Xr ipsecadm 1 .
.It proto
The security protocol needed by
.Nm delspi
or
.Nm group
to uniquely specifiy the SA. 
The default value is 50 which means
.Nm IPPROTO_ESP .
.It chain
Delete the whole SPI chain, otherwise delete only the SPI given.
.It dst2
The second IP destination address used by
.Nm group .
.It spi2
The second SPI used by
.Nm group .
.It proto2
The second security protocol used by
.Nm group .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLE
Setup a SPI which uses new esp with 3des encryption and HMAC-SHA1
authentication:
.Pp
ipsecadm -enc 3des -auth sha1 -spi 1001 -dst 169.20.12.2 -src 169.20.12.3
-key 638063806380638063806380638063806380638063806380 -authp 1234123412341234
.Pp
Setup a SPI for authentication with old ah only:
.Pp
ipsecadm old ah -auth md5 -spi 1001 -dst 169.20.12.2 -src 169.20.12.3 
-key 12341234deadbeef
