.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm reboot
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl q
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
.Pp
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
as described in
.Xr fsck 8 .
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Pp
.Ss Cold starts
.Pp
A disk-boot program
.Pq Pa /usr/mdec/ufsboot
will attempt to load
.Pa bsd
from partition ``a'' of the boot device,
which must currently be an ``sd'' disk.
Alternatively, the network boot program
.Pq Pa /usr/mdec/netboot
will load
.Pa bsd
from the NFS root as determined by the procedure described in
.Xr diskless 8 .
.Pp
The
.Fl s
flag to the bootloader will bring the system up in single-user mode.
The
.Fl a
flag instructs the system to prompt for the location of the root filesystem
and the primary swap partition.
The
.Fl d
flag to the bootloader will bring the system up in debug mode.
Here it waits for a kernel debugger connect; see
.Xr ddb 8 .
Other flags are currently ignored.
.Pp
At any time you can break back to the ROM by pressing the `L1' and `a'
keys at the same time (if the console is a serial port the same is
achieved by sending a `break').
If you do this accidentally you can continue whatever was in progress
by typing `c' followed by the return key.
