.Sh NAME
.Nm pflogd
.Nd packet filter loging daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pflogd
.Op Fl D
.Op Fl d Ar delay
.Op Fl f Ar filename
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Op Fl s Ar snaplen
.Op Ar expression
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a background daemon which reads packets logged by
.Xr pf 8
to a logging interface (normally
.Pa pflog0 )
and writes the packets to a logfile (normally
.Pa /var/log/pflog )
in
.Xr tcpdump 8
binary format.
These logs can be reviewed later using the
.Ar -r
option of
.Xr tcpdump 8 , hopefully offline in case there are bugs in the packet
parsing code of
.Xr tcpdump 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
closes and then re-opens the log file when it receives
.Va SIGHUP ,
permitting
.Xr newsyslog 8
to rotate logfiles automatically.
.Va SIGALRM
causes
.Nm
to flush the current logfile buffers to the disk, thus making the most
recent logs available.
The buffers are also flushed every
.Ar delay
seconds.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar delay
Time in seconds to delay between automatic flushes of the file.
This may be specified with a value between 5 and 3600 seconds.
If not specified, the default is 60 seconds.
.It Fl D
Debugging mode.
.Nm
does not disassociate from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Specify the interface from which
.Xr pf 8
logs are read; the default is
.Ar pflog0 .
.It Fl f Ar filename
Log output filename. Default is
.Pa /var/log/pflog .
.It Fl s Ar snaplen
Analyze at most the first
.Ar snaplen
bytes of data from each packet rather than the default of 96.
The default of 96 is adequate for IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP headers but may
truncate protocol information for other protocols.
Other file parsers may desire a higher snaplen.
.It Ar expression
selects which packets will be dumped, using the regular language of
.Xr tcpdump 8 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/pflogd.pid -compact
.It Pa /var/run/pflogd.pid
process ID of current
.It Pa /var/log/pflog
Default log file
