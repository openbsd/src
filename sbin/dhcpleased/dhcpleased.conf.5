.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpleased.conf
.Nd dynamic host configuration protocol client daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr dhcpleased 8
daemon is a dynamic host configuration protocol client daemon.
.Pp
The
.Nm
config file is divided into the following main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Interfaces
If an interface requires non-default options, they can be defined in
this section.
Most configurations do not require this.
.El
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic interface )
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Sh INTERFACES
A list of interfaces to overwrite defaults:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.Ic interface Ar name Brq Op Ar option ...
.Ed
.Pp
.Ic interface
options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic send client id Ar client-id
Send the dhcp client identifier option with a value of
.Ar client-id .
If
.Ar client-id
consists of a series of octets of two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated by
colons, the first octet is used as the type and the rest as value.
The MAC address 00:53:FF:AA:BB:CC would be configured as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
send client id "01:00:53:FF:AA:BB:CC"
.Ed
.Pp
Otherwise the string
.Ar client-id
is sent verbatim with type zero.
The default is to send the interface's MAC address as client identifier.
.It Ic send vendor class id Ar vendor-class-id
Send the dhcp vendor class identifier option with a value of
.Ar vendor-class-id .
The default is to not send a vendor class identifier.
