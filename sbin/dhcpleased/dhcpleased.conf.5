.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpleased.conf
.Nd dynamic host configuration protocol client daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr dhcpleased 8
daemon is a dynamic host configuration protocol client daemon.
.Pp
The
.Nm
config file is divided into the following main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Interfaces
If an interface requires non-default options, they can be defined in
this section.
Most configurations do not require this.
.El
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic interface ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Sh INTERFACES
A list of interfaces to overwrite defaults:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.Ic interface Ar name Cm { Oo Ar option ... Oc Cm }
.Ed
.Pp
.Ic interface
options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic ignore dns
Ignore nameservers from leases on this interface.
The default is to not ignore nameservers.
.It Ic ignore routes
Ignore routes from leases on this interface.
The default is to not ignore routes.
.It Ic ignore Ar server-ip
Ignore leases from
.Ar server-ip .
This option can be listed multiple times.
The default is to not ignore servers.
.It Ic send client id Ar client-id
Send the DHCP client identifier option with a value of
.Ar client-id .
If
.Ar client-id
consists of a series of octets of two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated by
colons, the first octet is used as the type and the rest as value.
The MAC address 00:53:FF:AA:BB:CC would be configured as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
send client id "01:00:53:FF:AA:BB:CC"
.Ed
.Pp
Otherwise the string
.Ar client-id
is sent verbatim.
The default is to send the interface's MAC address as client identifier.
.Pp
When
.Ar client-id
is not a hardware address, it is supposed to be sent as hardware type 0 but
the majority of DHCP clients and servers do not implement this and neither
does
.Nm .
If a server is encountered that requires this, a 0 byte can be encoded as \e0.
The client identifier
.Dq foobar
with hardware type 0 would be configured as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
send client id "\e0foobar"
.Ed
.It Ic send host name Ar host-name
Send the DHCP client host name option with a value of
.Ar host-name .
The default is to send the name of the host.
.It Ic send no host name
Do not send a DHCP host name option.
The default is to send a DHCP host name option with the name of the host.
.It Ic send vendor class id Ar vendor-class-id
Send the DHCP vendor class identifier option with a value of
.Ar vendor-class-id .
The default is to not send a vendor class identifier.
