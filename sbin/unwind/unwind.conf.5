.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr unwind 8
daemon is a validating DNS resolver.

.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration

.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic forwarder ,
.Ic port ,
or
.Ic Dot ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
fwd1=192.0.2.53
fwd2=192.0.2.153
forwarder { $fwd1 $fwd2 }

.El
.Pp
.Nm unwind
can detect when it is running behind a
.Dq Captive Portal
by sending a HTTP request and checking the response against the
configured expected response.
The check will be triggered when
.Xr dhclient 8
reports new nameservers.
If the response does not match,
.Nm unwind
will use the DHCP provided nameservers and periodically re-checks if the user
passed the
.Dq Captive Portal .
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic captive portal Brq ...
.Dq CaptivePortal
detection is configured inside the
.Oc captive portal
block.
.Bl -tag -width "url URL" -compatc

is set to
.Cm yes
.Nm unwind
automatically triggers a
.Dq Captive Portal
check when the network is changed.
When set to
.Cm no

.Dq Captive Portal
check can be triggered by
.Xr unwindctl 8 .
