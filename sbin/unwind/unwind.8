.Sh NAME
.Nm unwind
.Nd validating DNS resolver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a validating DNS resolver.
It is intended to run on client machines like workstations or laptops and only
listens on localhost.
.Nm
sends DNS queries to nameservers to answer queries and switches to resolvers
learned from
.Xr dhclient 8
or
.Xr slaacd 8
if it detects that DNS queries are blocked by the local network.
It periodically probes if DNS is no longer blocked and switches back to
querying nameservers itself.
.Pp
.Nm
is usually started at boot time, and can be enabled by
setting the following in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local :
.Pp
.Dl unwind_flags=\&"\&"
.Pp
See
.Xr rc 8
and
.Xr rc.conf 8
for more information on the boot process
and enabling daemons.
.Pp
Adding
.Dl prepend domain-name-servers \&"127.0.0.1\&"
to
.Pa /etc/dhclient.conf
configures a machine using DHCP to use
.Nm .
.Pp
A running
.Nm
can be controlled with the
.Xr unwindctl 8
utility.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use an alternate location for the default control socket.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
Multiple
.Fl v
options increase the verbosity.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/unwind/db/root.keyXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/unwind.conf
Default
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/unwind.sock
.Ux Ns -domain
socket used for communication with
.Xr unwindctl 8 .
.It Pa /var/unwind/db/root.key
Trust anchor for DNSSEC validation.
