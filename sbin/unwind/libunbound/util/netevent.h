/**
 * \file
 *
 * This file contains event notification functions.
 *
 * There are three types of communication points
 *    o UDP socket - perthread buffer.
 *    o TCP-accept socket - array of TCP-sockets, socketcount.
 *    o TCP socket - own buffer, parent-TCPaccept, read/write state,
 *                   number of bytes read/written, timeout.
 *
 * There are sockets aimed towards our clients and towards the internet.
 *    o frontside - aimed towards our clients, queries come in, answers back.
 *    o behind - aimed towards internet, to the authoritative DNS servers.
 *
 * Several event types are available:
 *    o comm_base - for thread safety of the comm points, one per thread.
 *    o comm_point - udp and tcp networking, with callbacks.
 *    o comm_timer - a timeout with callback.
 *    o comm_signal - callbacks when signal is caught.
 *    o comm_reply - holds reply info during networking callback.
