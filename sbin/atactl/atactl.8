.Sh NAME
.Nm atactl
.Nd a program to manipulate ATA (IDE) devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm atactl
.Ar device
.Ar command
.Oo
.Ar arg Oo ...
.Oc
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows a user or system administrator to issue commands to and otherwise
control devices which reside on standard IDE and ATA controllers.
It is used by specifying
a device to manipulate, the command to perform, and any arguments
the command may require.
.Pp
The following commands may be used on IDE and ATA devices.
Note that not all devices support all commands.
.Pp
If the
.Ar device
is specified without a
.Ar command ,
the
.Cm identify
command is implied.
.Sh COMMANDS
.Pp
.Cm identify
.Pp
Identify the specified device, displaying the device's vendor, product,
revision strings, supported capabilities and enabled capabilities.
.Pp
.Cm idle
.Pp
Place the specified device into Idle mode.
This mode may consume less power than Active mode.
.Pp
.Cm standby
.Pp
Place the specified device into Standby mode.
This mode will consume less power than Idle mode.
.Pp
.Cm sleep
.Pp
Place the specified device into Sleep mode.
This mode will consume less power than Standby mode,
but requires a device reset to resume operation.
Typically the
.Xr wd 4
driver performs this reset automatically, but this should still be
used with caution.
.Pp
.Cm setidle
.Ar standby-timer
.Pp
Places the specified device into Idle mode, and sets the Standby timer
to
.Ar standby-timer
seconds.
A value of 0 will disable the Standby timer.
.Pp
.Cm setstandby
.Ar standby-timer
.Pp
Places the specified device into Standby mode, and sets the Standby timer
to
.Ar standby-timer
seconds.
A value of 0 will disable the Standby timer.
.Pp
.Cm checkpower
.Pp
Will print out if the device is in Active, Idle, or Standby power
management mode.
.Pp
.Cm apmset
.Ar power-management-level
.Pp
Enables and sets the advanced power management level to the requested
level on the specified device (if supported).
Device performance may
increase with increasing power management levels at the cost of
potentially requiring more power.
Values up to and including 126 allow
the device to go into standby mode and spin-down the disk.
This
.Em may cause disk time-outs
and is therefore
.Em not
recommended.
These values are more suitable optimization for low power
usage on infrequently used devices.
Values 127 up to and including 253 do not allow the device to go to
standby mode and are more suitable for optimization for performance.
Support for advanced power management is indicated by the device with
.Sq Advanced Power Management feature set
in the output of the
.Cm identify
command.
.Pp
.Cm apmdisable
.Pp
Disables support for advanced power management on the specified device.
Note that devices supporting advanced powermanagement may refuse to
disable it, resulting in an
.Sq ATA device returned Aborted Command
warning.
.Pp
.Cm acousticset
.Ar acoustic-management-level
.Pp
Enables and sets the automatic acoustic management level to the requested
level on the specified device (if supported).
Device performance may
increase with increasing automatic acoustic management levels at the cost of
potentially generating more noise and requiring more power.
Valid values are 0 up to and including 126.
Support for automatic acoustic management is indicated by the device with
.Sq Automatic Acoustic Management feature set
in the output of the
.Cm identify
command.
.Pp
.Cm acousticdisable
.Pp
Disables support for automatic acoustic management on the specified device.
Note that devices supporting automatic acoustic management may refuse to
disable it, resulting in an
.Sq ATA device returned Aborted Command
warning.
.Pp
.Cm podenable
.Pp
Allows the specified device to revert to power-on default (pod) settings
after a reset.
.Pp
.Cm poddisable
.Pp
Disallows the specified device to revert to power-on default (pod) settings
after a reset.
.Pp
.Cm puisenable
.Pp
Enables power-up in standby (puis) on the specified device, causing the
device to wait with spinning up the disks after power-up.
This may cause problems at boot if the device is to slow in spin-up.
This option is therefore
.Em not recommended
unless the implications are understood.
Note that the power-up in standby mode stays enabled over power-downs,
hardware and software resets.
Support for power-up in standby is indicated by the device with
.Sq Power-up in standby feature set
in the output of the
.Cm identify
command.
.Pp
.Cm puisdisable
.Pp
Disables power-up in standby (puis) on the specified device, causing the
device to spin up the disks after power-up.
This should be the factory
default setting of the device and it is recommended to leave this
setting disabled.
.Pp
.Cm puisspinup
.Pp
Explicitly spins up the device if it powered-up into standby mode (i.e.
power-up in standby was enabled).
.Pp
.Cm readaheadenable
.Pp
Enables read look-ahead on the specified device.
This may increase performance.
Support for and status of read look-ahead is indicated by
the device with
.Sq read look-ahead
in the output of the
.Cm identify
command.
.Pp
.Cm readaheaddisable
.Pp
Disables read look-ahead on the specified device.
This may decrease performance.
Note that the device may use
.Sq vendor specific
behaviour in implementing this, so it is
.Em not
recommended to issue this command on a disk containing any currently
mounted filesystems.
.Pp
.Cm secsetpass
.Ar user
.Ar high | maximum
.br
.Cm secsetpass
.Ar master
.Pp
Sets password and security level for the specified device.
There are two passwords, user and master, and two security levels, high and
maximum.
The maximum password length is 32 symbols.
The security system is enabled by sending a user password to the device with
this command.
When the security system is enabled, access to user data on the device is
denied after a power cycle until the user password is sent to the device with
the
.Cm secunlock
command.
A master password may be set in a addition to the user password.
The purpose of the master password is to allow an administrator to establish
a password that is kept secret from the user, and which may be used to unlock
the device if the user password is lost.
Setting the master password does not enable security system.
Each master password change decrements the master password revision
code value which is displayed in the
.Cm identify
command output if supported.
After value 0x0001 is reached the next value will be 0xfffe.
The security level determines device behavior when the master password is used
to unlock the device.
When the security level is set to high the device requires the
.Cm secunlock
command if the master password is used to unlock.
When the security level is set to maximum the device requires a
.Cm secerase
command if the master password is used to unlock.
Execution of the
.Cm secerase
command erases all user data on the device.
.Pp
.Cm secunlock
.Ar user | master
.Pp
Unlocks the specified device with user or master password.
The device will always unlock if a valid user password is received.
If the security level was set to high during the last
.Cm secsetpass
command, the device will unlock if the master password is received.
If the security level was set to maximum during the last
.Cm secsetpass
command, the device won't unlock if the master password is received.
.Pp
.Cm secerase
.Ar user | master
.Op Ar enhanced
.Pp
Erases all user data and unlocks the specified device.
Execution of this command with master password is the only way to unlock a
device locked at maximum security level with
.Cm secsetpass
command if user password is lost or unknown.
There are two erase modes: normal and enhanced.
Default erase mode is normal.
In the normal erase mode this command will write binary zeroes to
all user data areas.
The enhanced erase mode is optional and may not be supported by your device.
When enhanced erase mode specified, the device will write predetermined
data patterns to all user data areas.
In enhanced erase mode, all previously written user data will be overwritten,
including sectors that are no longer in use due to reallocation.
This command will disable the device lock mode, however, the master password
will still be stored internally within the device and may be reactivated later
when a new user password is set.
.Pp
.Cm secfreeze
.Pp
Prevents changes to passwords until a following power cycle.
The purpose of this command is to prevent password setting attacks on the
security system.
After command completion any other commands that update the device lock mode
will be aborted.
.Pp
.Cm secdisablepass
.Ar user | master
.Pp
Disables the lock mode for the specified device with user or master password.
This command won't change the master password.
The master password will be reactivated when a user password is set.
.Pp
Support for the security commands is indicated by the device with
.Sq Security Mode feature set
in the output of the
.Cm identify
command.
.Pp
.Em WARNING
.br
Be very careful while playing with these commands.
If you lose the user and master passwords the device will not be accessible
at all.
Don't use it unless the implications are completely understood.
.Pp
.Cm smartenable
.Pp
Enables SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) on the
specified device (if supported).
This causes the device to record information
for prediction of device degradation and/or faults.
Support for SMART is indicated by the device with
.Sq SMART feature set
in the output of the
.Cm identify
command.
.Pp
.Cm smartdisable
.Pp
Disables support for SMART on the specified device.
Note that this means that the device will no longer record any SMART
information.
.Pp
Note that SMART
.Em must
be enabled while executing the next described commands or the device will
return an error.
.Pp
.Cm smartstatus
.Pp
Reads the reliability status of the specified device.
If the device reports
that one of its thresholds is exceeded (a strong indication of imminent
failure), the warning
.Sq SMART threshold exceeded!
is printed to stderr and a status of 2 is returned.
.Pp
.Cm smartautosave
.Ar enable | disable
.Pp
Enables/disables attribute autosave feature on the specified device.
.Pp
.Cm smartoffline
.Ar subcommand
.Pp
Causes the specified device to immediately initiate the optional set of
activities that collect SMART data in off-line mode and then save this data
to the device's non-volatile memory, or execute a self-diagnostic test
routines in either captive or off-line mode.
The
.Ar subcommand
may be one of the following:
.Bl -inset -offset indent
.It Em collect
start SMART off-line data collection immediately;
.It Em shortoffline
execute SMART short self-test routine immediately in off-line mode;
.It Em extenoffline
execute SMART extended self-test routine immediately in off-line mode;
.It Em abort
abort off-line mode self-test routine;
.It Em shortcaptive
execute SMART short self-test routine immediately in captive mode;
.It Em extencaptive
execute SMART extended self-test routine immediately in captive mode.
.El
.Pp
Note that executing self-test routines in captive mode causes the device to
be not accessible until the routine completes.
This option is therefore
.Em not recommended
unless the implications are understood.
.Pp
.Cm smartread
.Pp
Reads various SMART information from the specified device and prints it to
stdout.
.Pp
.Cm smartreadlog
.Ar log
.Pp
Reads specified
.Ar log
and prints it to stdout.
The
.Ar log
may by one of the following:
.Bl -inset -offset indent
.It Em directory
error log directory;
.It Em summary
summary error log;
.It Em comp
comprehensive error log;
.It Em selftest
self-test log.
.El
.Pp
.Cm readattr
.Pp
Displays attributes thresholds and values for the specified device.
Besides attributes values device vendor can provide additional information
shown in the last column ``Raw''.
Attributes names can be completely wrong since they vary between vendors and
even models, so don't rely on it.
SMART must be enabled while executing this command or the device will return
an error.
.Pp
SMART commands and
.Cm readattr
command are for experts only.
If you can't understand its meaning don't ask us, read ATA working drafts.
.Pp
.Cm writecachedisable
.Pp
Disable the write cache on the specified device (if supported).
This may decrease performance.
Support for and status of write caching is indicated by the device with
.Sq write cache
in the output of the
.Cm identify
command.
.Pp
.Cm writecacheenable
.Pp
Enables the write cache on the specified device (if supported).
This may increase performance, however data still in the device's cache at
powerdown
.Em may be lost.
The
.Xr wd 4
driver performs a cache flush automatically before shutdown.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Cm # atactl /dev/wd0c identify
.Pp
Displays the vendor, product, revision strings and capabilities (such as
support for SMART) as reported by
.Pa /dev/wd0 .
.Pp
.Cm # atactl /dev/wd1c smartenable
.Pp
Enables the SMART support on
.Pa /dev/wd1
for detection of early warning signs of device failure.
.Pp
.Cm 0 * * * * /sbin/atactl /dev/wd0c smartstatus >/dev/null
.Pp
In a
.Xr crontab 5
entry queries
.Pa /dev/wd0
each hour for early warning signs of failure.
If the device exceeded one of the SMART thresholds,
.Nm
will output
.Sq SMART threshold exceeded!
to stderr and
.Xr cron 8
will mail it.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Not all devices are created equally.
Some may not support the feature sets
and/or commands needed to perform the requested action, even when the
.Cm identify
command indicates support for the requested action.
The device will typically respond with an
.Sq ATA device returned Aborted Command
if the requested action is not supported.
Similarly a device might not implement all commands in a feature set,
so even though disabling a feature works, enabling might not.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
.Xr wd 4
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
command was written by Ken Hornstein.
It was based heavily on the scsictl command written by Jason R. Thorpe.
Support for acoustic management, advanced power management, power-up in
standby, read look-ahead and SMART was added by Wouter Slegers.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Ox 2.6 .
Support for acoustic management, advanced power management, power-up in
standby, read look-ahead and SMART was added in
.Ox 2.9 .
.Sh BUGS
The output from the
.Cm identify
command is rather ugly.
.Pp
Disabling read look-head with the
.Cm readaheaddisable
might cause problems with mounted filesystems on that device.
