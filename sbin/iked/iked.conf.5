.Sh NAME
.Nm iked.conf
.Nd IKEv2 configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for
.Xr iked 8 ,
the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) daemon for IPsec.
IPsec itself is a pair of protocols:
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),
which provides integrity and confidentiality;
and Authentication Header (AH),
which provides integrity.
The IPsec protocol itself is described in
.Xr ipsec 4 .
.Pp
In its most basic form, a flow is established between hosts and/or
networks, and then Security Associations (SA) are established,
which detail how the desired protection will be achieved.
IPsec uses flows to determine whether to apply security services to an
IP packet or not.
.Xr iked 8
is used to set up flows and establish SAs automatically,
by specifying
.Sq ikev2
policies in
.Nm
(see
.Sx AUTOMATIC KEYING POLICIES,
below).
.Pp
Alternative methods of setting up flows and SAs are also possible
using manual keying or automatic keying using the older ISAKMP/Oakley
a.k.a. IKEv1 protocol.
Manual keying is not recommended, but can be convenient for quick
setups and testing.
Those procedures are not documented within this page,
see
.Xr ipsec.conf 5
and
.Xr isakmpd 8
for more information about manual keying and ISAKMP support.
.Sh IKED.CONF FILE FORMAT
.Nm
is divided into three main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr iked 8 .
.It Sy Automatic Keying Policies
Policies to set up IPsec flows and SAs automatically.
.El
.Pp
Lines beginning with
.Sq #
and empty lines are regarded as comments,
and ignored.
Lines may be split using the
.Sq \e
character.
.Pp
Addresses can be specified in CIDR notation (matching netblocks),
as symbolic host names, interface names, or interface group names.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/macros.conf"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits
and underscores.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example
.Ic flow ,
.Ic from ,
.Ic esp ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
remote_gw = "192.168.3.12"
ikev2 esp from 192.168.7.0/24 to 192.168.8.0/24 peer $remote_gw
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
Here are the settings that can be set globally:
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Ic user Ar name Ar password
.Xr iked 8
supports user-based authentication by tunneling the Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP) over IKEv2.
In its most basic form, the users will be authenticated against a
local, integrated password database that is configured with the
.Ic user
lines in
.Nm
and the
.Ar username
and
.Ar password
arguments.
Note that the password has to be specified in plain text which is
required to support different challenge-based EAP methods like
EAP-MD5 or EAP-MSCHAPv2.
.El
.Sh AUTOMATIC KEYING POLICIES
This section is used to configure policies that will be used by
.Xr iked 8
to set up flows and SAs automatically.
Some examples of setting up automatic keying:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# Set up a VPN:
# First between the gateway machines 192.168.3.1 and 192.168.3.2
# Second between the networks 10.1.1.0/24 and 10.1.2.0/24
ikev2 esp from 192.168.3.1 to 192.168.3.2
ikev2 esp from 10.1.1.0/24 to 10.1.2.0/24 peer 192.168.3.2
.Ed
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Xo
.Ic ikev2
.Op Ar name
.Op Ar mode
.Op Ar encap
.\" .Op Ar tmode
.Xc
.Ar name
is an optional arbitrary string identifying the policy.
The name should only occur once in
.Nm
or any incluced files.
If omitted,
a name will be generated automatically for the policy.
.Pp
.Ar mode
specifies the IKE mode to use:
one of
.Ar passive
or
.Ar active .
When
.Ar passive
is specified,
.Xr iked 8
will not immediately start negotiation of this tunnel, but wait for an incoming
request from the remote peer.
When
.Ar active
is specified, negotiation will be started at once.
If omitted,
.Ar passive
mode will be used.
.Pp
.Ar encap
specifies the encapsulation protocol to be used.
Possible protocols are
.Ar esp
and
.Ar ah ;
the default is
.Ar esp .
.\" .Pp
.\" .Ar tmode
.\" describes the encapsulation mode to be used.
.\" Possible modes are
.\" .Ar tunnel
.\" and
.\" .Ar transport ;
.\" the default is
.\" .Ar tunnel .
.It Ic proto Ar protocol
The optional
.Ic proto
parameter restricts the flow to a specific IP protocol.
Common protocols are
.Xr icmp 4 ,
.Xr tcp 4 ,
and
.Xr udp 4 .
For a list of all the protocol name to number mappings used by
.Xr iked 8 ,
see the file
.Pa /etc/protocols .
.It Xo
.Ic from Ar src
.Op Ic port Ar sport
.Oo ( Ar srcnat ) Oc
.Ic to Ar dst
.Op Ic port Ar dport
.Xc
Specify one or more traffic selectors for this policy which will be
used to negotiate the IPsec flows between the IKEv2 peers.
During the negotiation, the peers may decide to narrow a flow to a
subset of the configured traffic selector networks to match the
policies on each side.
.Pp
Each traffic selector will apply for packets with source address
.Ar src
and destination address
.Ar dst .
The keyword
.Ar any
will match any address (i.e. 0.0.0.0/0).
If the
.Ar src
argument specifies a fictional source ID,
the
.Ar srcnat
parameter can be used to specify the actual source address.
This can be used in outgoing NAT/BINAT scenarios as described below.
.Pp
The optional
.Ic port
modifiers restrict the traffic selectors to the specified ports.
They are only valid in conjunction with the
.Xr tcp 4
and
.Xr udp 4
protocols.
Ports can be specified by number or by name.
For a list of all port name to number mappings used by
.Xr ipsecctl 8 ,
see the file
.Pa /etc/services .
.It Ic local Ar localip Ic peer Ar remote
The
.Ic local
parameter specifies the address or FQDN of the local endpoint.
Unless the gateway is multi-homed or uses address aliases,
this option is generally not needed.
.Pp
The
.Ic peer
parameter specifies the address or FQDN of the remote endpoint.
For host-to-host connections where
.Ar dst
is identical to
.Ar remote ,
this option is generally not needed as it will be set to
.Ar dst
automatically.
If it is not specified or if the keyword
.Ar any
is given, the default peer is used.
.It Xo
.Ic ikesa
.Ic auth Ar algorithm
.Ic enc Ar algorithm
.Ic prf Ar algorithm
.Ic group Ar group
.Xc
These parameters define the mode and cryptographic transforms to be
used for the IKE SA negotiation, also known as phase 1.
The IKE SA will be used to authenticate the machines and to set up an
encrypted channel for the IKEv2 protocol.
.Pp
Possible values for
.Ic auth ,
.Ic enc ,
.Ic prf ,
.Ic group ,
and the default proposals are described below in
.Sx CRYPTO TRANSFORMS .
If omitted,
.Xr iked 8
will use the default proposals for the IKEv2 protocol.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic childsa
.Ic auth Ar algorithm
.Ic enc Ar algorithm
.Ic group Ar group
.Xc
These parameters define the cryptographic transforms to be used for
the Child SA negotiation, also known as phase 2.
Each Child SA will be used to negotiate the actual IPsec SAs.
The initial Child SA is always negotiated with the initial IKEv2 key
exchange, additional Child SAs may be negotiated with additional
Child SA key exchanges for an established IKE SA.
.Pp
Possible values for
.Ic auth ,
.Ic enc ,
.Ic group ,
and the default proposals are described below in
.Sx CRYPTO TRANSFORMS .
If omitted,
.Xr iked 8
will use the default proposals for the ESP or AH protocol.
The
.Ic group
option will only be used to enable Perfect Forwarding Security (PFS)
for additional Child SAs exchanges that are not part of the initial
key exchange.
.It Ic srcid Ar string Ic dstid Ar string
.Ic srcid
defines an ID of type
.Dq FQDN ,
.Dq DER_ASN1_DN ,
.Dq IPV4_ADDR ,
.Dq IPV6_ADDR ,
or
.Dq RFC822_ADDR
that will be used by
.Xr iked 8
as the identity of the local peer.
If the argument is an email address (reyk@example.com),
.Xr iked 8
will use RFC822_ADDR as the ID type.
The DER_ASN1_DN type will be used if the string starts with a slash
.Sq /
(/C=DE/../CN=10.0.0.1/emailAddress=reyk@example.com).
If the argument is an IPv4 address or a compressed IPv6 address,
the ID types IPV4_ADDR or IPV6_ADDR will be used.
Anything else is considered to be an FQDN.
.Pp
If
.Ic srcid
is omitted,
the default is to use the hostname of the local machine,
see
.Xr hostname 1
to set or print the hostname.
.Pp
.Ic dstid
is similar to
.Ic srcid ,
but instead specifies the ID to be used
by the remote peer.
.It Op Ar ikeauth
Specify the mode to mutually authenticate the peers.
Non-psk modes will require to set up certificates and RSA public keys,
see
.Xr iked 8
for more information.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width $domain -compact -offset indent
.It Ic eap Ar type
Use EAP to authenticate the initiator.
The only supported EAP
.Ar type
is currently
.Ar MSCHAP-V2 .
The responder will use RSA public key authentication.
.It Ic psk Ar string
Use a pre-shared key
.Ar string
or hex value (starting with 0x) for authentication.
.It Ic rsa
Use RSA public key authentication.
This is the default mode if no option is specified.
.El
.It Ic tag Ar string
Add a
.Xr pf 4
tag to all packets of IPsec SAs created for this connection.
This will allow matching packets for this connection by defining
rules in
.Xr pf.conf 5
using the
.Cm tagged
keyword.
.Pp
The following variables can be used in tags to include information
from the remote peer on runtime:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width $domain -compact -offset indent
.It Ar $id
The
.Ic dstid
that was proposed by the remote peer to identify itself.
It will be expanded to
.Ar id-value ,
e.g.\&
.Ar foo.example.com .
To limit the size of the derived tag,
.Xr iked 8
will extract the common name 
.Sq CN=
from DER_ASN1_DN IDs, for example
.Ar /C=DE/../CN=10.1.1.1/..
will be expanded to
.Ar 10.1.1.1 .
.It Ar $domain
Extract the domain from IDs of type FQDN, RFC822_ADDR or DER_ASN1_DN.
.It Ar $name
The name of the IKEv2 policy that was configured in
.Nm
or automatically generated by
.Xr iked 8 .
.El
.Pp
For example, if the ID is
.Ar foo.example.com
or
.Ar user@example.com ,
.Dq ipsec-$domain
expands to
.Dq ipsec-example.com .
The variable expansion for the
.Ar tag
directive occurs only at runtime, not during configuration file parse time.
.El
.Sh PACKET FILTERING
IPsec traffic appears unencrypted on the
.Xr enc 4
interface
and can be filtered accordingly using the
.Ox
packet filter,
.Xr pf 4 .
The grammar for the packet filter is described in
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
.Pp
The following components are relevant to filtering IPsec traffic:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It external interface
Interface for IKE traffic and encapsulated IPsec traffic.
.It proto udp port 500
IKE traffic on the external interface.
.It proto udp port 4500
IKE NAT-Traversal traffic on the external interface.
.It proto ah \*(Ba esp
Encapsulated IPsec traffic
on the external interface.
.It enc0
Interface for outgoing traffic before it's been encapsulated,
and incoming traffic after it's been decapsulated.
State on this interface should be interface bound;
see
.Xr enc 4
for further information.
.It proto ipencap
[tunnel mode only]
IP-in-IP traffic flowing between gateways
on the enc0 interface.
.It tagged ipsec-example.org
Match traffic of IPsec SAs using the
.Ic tag
keyword.
.El
.Pp
If the filtering rules specify to block everything by default,
the following rule
would ensure that IPsec traffic never hits the packet filtering engine,
and is therefore passed:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set skip on enc0
.Ed
.Pp
In the following example, all traffic is blocked by default.
IPsec-related traffic from gateways {192.168.3.1, 192.168.3.2} and
networks {10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24} is permitted.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
block on ix0
block on enc0

pass  in on ix0 proto udp from 192.168.3.2 to 192.168.3.1 \e
	port {500, 4500}
pass out on ix0 proto udp from 192.168.3.1 to 192.168.3.2 \e
	port {500, 4500}

pass  in on ix0 proto esp from 192.168.3.2 to 192.168.3.1
pass out on ix0 proto esp from 192.168.3.1 to 192.168.3.2

pass  in on enc0 proto ipencap from 192.168.3.2 to 192.168.3.1 \e
	keep state (if-bound)
pass out on enc0 proto ipencap from 192.168.3.1 to 192.168.3.2 \e
	keep state (if-bound)
pass  in on enc0 from 10.0.2.0/24 to 10.0.1.0/24 \e
	keep state (if-bound)
pass out on enc0 from 10.0.1.0/24 to 10.0.2.0/24 \e
	keep state (if-bound)
.Ed
.Pp
.Xr pf 4
has the ability to filter IPsec-related packets
based on an arbitrary
.Em tag
specified within a ruleset.
The tag is used as an internal marker
which can be used to identify the packets later on.
This could be helpful,
for example,
in scenarios where users are connecting in from differing IP addresses,
or to support queue-based bandwidth control,
since the enc0 interface does not support it.
.Pp
The following
.Xr pf.conf 5
fragment uses queues for all IPsec traffic with special
handling for developers and employees:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
altq on ix0 cbq bandwidth 1000Mb \e
	queue { deflt, developers, employees, ipsec }
    queue deflt bandwidth 10% priority 0 cbq(default ecn)
    queue developers bandwidth 75% priority 7 cbq(borrow red)
    queue employees bandwidth 5% cbq(red)
    queue ipsec bandwidth 10% cbq(red)

pass out on ix0 proto esp queue ipsec

pass out on ix0 tagged ipsec-developers.example.com queue developers
pass out on ix0 tagged ipsec-employees.example.com queue employees
.Ed
.Pp
The tags will be assigned by the following
.Nm
example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ikev2 esp from 10.1.1.0/24 to 10.1.2.0/24 peer 192.168.3.2 \e
	tag ipsec-$domain
.Ed
.Sh OUTGOING NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION
In some network topologies it is desirable to perform NAT on traffic leaving
through the VPN tunnel.
In order to achieve that,
the
.Ar src
argument is used to negotiate the desired network ID with the peer
and the
.Ar srcnat
parameter defines the true local subnet,
so that a correct SA can be installed on the local side.
.Pp
For example,
if the local subnet is 192.168.1.0/24 and all the traffic
for a specific VPN peer should appear as coming from 10.10.10.1,
the following configuration is used:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ikev2 esp from 10.10.10.1 (192.168.1.0/24) to 192.168.2.0/24 \e
	peer 10.10.20.1
.Ed
.Pp
Naturally,
a relevant NAT rule is required in
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
For the example above,
this would be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
match on enc0 from 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.2.0/24 nat-to 10.10.10.1
.Ed
.Pp
From the peer's point of view,
the local end of the VPN tunnel is declared to be 10.10.10.1
and all the traffic arrives with that source address.
.Sh CRYPTO TRANSFORMS
The following authentication types are permitted with the
.Ic auth

.It Li cast Ta "128 bits" Ta "[ESP only]"
.It Li null Ta "" Ta "[ESP only]"
.El
.Pp
Use of DES as an encryption algorithm is not recommended (except for
backwards compatibility) due to the short key length.
.Pp
DES requires 8 bytes to form a 56-bit key and 3DES requires 24 bytes
to form its 168-bit key.
This is because the most significant bit of each byte is used for parity.
.Pp
The keysize of AES-CTR is actually 128-bit.
However as well as the key, a 32-bit nonce has to be supplied.
Thus 160 bits of key material have to be supplied.
.Pp
Using NULL with ESP will only provide authentication.
This is useful in setups where AH can not be used, e.g. when NAT is involved.
.Pp
The following group types are permitted with the
.Ic group
keyword:

The currently supported group types are either
MODP (exponentiation groups modulo a prime), 
EC2N (elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N]),
or
ECP (elliptic curve groups modulo a prime).
Please note that the EC2N groups are considered as insecure and only

.Sh EXAMPLES
The first example is intended for clients connecting to
.Xr iked 8
as an IPsec gateway, or IKEv2 responder, using mutual public key
authentication and additional challenge-based EAP-MSCHAPv2 password
authentication:
