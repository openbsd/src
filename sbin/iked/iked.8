.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm iked
.Op Fl dnvT

.Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
.Oc
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) daemon which performs mutual
authentication and is establishing and maintaining IPsec flows and
security associations (SAs) between the two peers.
.Pp
The IKEv2 protocol is defined in RFC 4306 which combines and updates
the previous standards ISAKMP/Oakley (RFC 2408), IKE (RFC 2409), and
the Internet DOI (RFC 2407).
.Nm
only supports the IKEv2 protocol;
have a look at
.Xr isakmpd 8
for ISAKMP/Oakley or IKEv1 support.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as the configuration file, instead of the default
.Pa /etc/iked.conf .
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.It Fl T
Disable NAT-Traversal and do not propose NAT-Traversal support to the peers.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/isakmpd/private/" -compact
.It /etc/iked.conf
The default
.Nm
configuration file.
.It /etc/isakmpd/ca/
The directory where CA certificates are kept.
.It /etc/isakmpd/certs/
The directory where IKE certificates are kept, both the local
certificate(s) and those of the peers, if a choice to have them kept
permanently has been made.
.It /etc/isakmpd/crls/
The directory where CRLs are kept.
.It /etc/isakmpd/private/
The directory where local private keys used for public key authentication
are kept.
The file
.Pa local.key
is used to store the local private key.
.It /etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/
The directory in which trusted public keys are kept.
The keys must be named in the fashion described above.
.It Pa /var/run/iked.sock
The default
.Nm
control socket.
