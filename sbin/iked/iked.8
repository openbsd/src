.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) daemon which performs mutual
authentication and which establishes and maintains IPsec flows and
security associations (SAs) between the two peers.
.Pp
The IKEv2 protocol is defined in RFC 4306,
which combines and updates the previous standards:
ISAKMP/Oakley (RFC 2408),
IKE (RFC 2409),
and the Internet DOI (RFC 2407).
.Nm
only supports the IKEv2 protocol;
support for
ISAKMP/Oakley and IKEv1
is provided by
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d

.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as the configuration file, instead of the default
