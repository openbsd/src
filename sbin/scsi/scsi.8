.in -\\n(iSu
.Ar out_fmt
can be
.Sq -
to read output data from stdin;
.Ar in_fmt
can be
.Sq -
to write input data to stdout.
.Pp
If debugging is not compiled in the kernel,
.Fl d
will have no effect.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to send commands to a SCSI device. It is also
a sample usage of the user-level SCSI commands.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar debug_level
Sets the SCSI kernel debug level.  The kernel must have been compiled
with the SCSIDEBUG
option.  See
.Pa /sys/scsi/scsi_debug.h
to figure out what to set the kernel debug level to.
.Pp
.It Fl z Ar seconds
Freezes all activity on all SCSI busses for a given number of
seconds.  If
.Fl v
is also specified, a BEL character is sent to the standard
output at the start and finish of the bus freeze.
This requires that the kernel be built with the SCSI_FREEZE kernel option.
This kernel code is not committed yet.
.Pp
.It Fl m Ar page
Read a device mode page.  The file
.Pa /usr/share/misc/scsi_modes
is read to discover how to interpret the mode data.  The environment
variable
.Ev SCSI_MODES
can specify a different file to use.
.Pp
.It Fl P Ar pc
Specify a page control field.  The page control
fields are
.Bd -literal -offset
0 Current Values
1 Changeable Values
2 Default Values
3 Saved Values
.Ed
.Pp
.It Fl e
Permits you to edit the fields.  It will use the editor specified
by your
.Ev EDITOR
environment variable.  To store changes permanently, 
edit page control 3 using the
.Fl P
flag.
.Pp
.It Fl p
Can be used against the "super scsi" device
.Pa /dev/scsi/super
to probe all devices with a given SCSI
.Ar lun
on a given SCSI bus.
The
.Ar bus
can be selected with the -b option and the default is 0.
The
.Ar lun
can be selected with the -l option and the default is 0.
See
.Xr scsi 4
for a description of the "super scsi" device.
.Pp
.It Fl r
Can be used in FreeBSD 1.1 to reprobe a specific SCSI device at a given
Bus, Target and Lun.
This is not needed in FreeBSD 2.1, since opening a fixed SCSI device
has the side effect of reprobing it, and probing with the bus with the
.Fl p
option should bring on line any newly found devices.
See
.Xr scsi 4
for a description of fixed SCSI devices.
.Pp
.It Fl c
Permits you to send user-level SCSI commands specified on
the command line to a
device.  The command is sent using the SCIOCCOMMAND ioctl, so the
device you are accessing must permit this ioctl. See
.Xr scsi 4
for full details of which minor devices permit the ioctl, and
.Xr scsi 3
for the full details on how to build up the commands and data phases
using the format arguments.
.Pp
.It Fl v
Turns on more verbose information.
.Pp
.It Fl s Ar seconds
Sets the command timeout to
.Ar seconds .
The default is two seconds.
.Pp
.It Fl c Ar cmd_fmt
Specifies the command as described in
.Xr scsi 3 "."
The additional arguments provide values for any variables
specified in the command format.
.Pp
.It Fl o Ar count out_fmt arg ...
Indicates that this is a data out command (i.e., data will be sent from
the system to the device) with
.Ar count
bytes of data. The data out is built up using the facilities described in
.Xr scsi 3
using the provided arguments to fill in any integer variables.
.Ar out_fmt
can be specified as a hyphen
.Pq Sq -
to indicate that the
.Ar count
bytes of data should be read from the standard input.
.Pp
.It Fl i Ar count in_fmt arg ...
Indicates that this is a data in command (i.e., data will be read from
the device into the system) with
.Ar count
bytes of data read in.  The information is extracted according to
.Ar in_fmt
using the facilities described in
.Xr scsi 3
and displayed on the standard output.
.Ar in_fmt
can be specified as a hyphen
.Pq Sq -
to indicate that the
.Ar count
bytes of data input should be written to the standard output.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To verify that the device type for the disk /dev/rsd0c is 0
(direct access device):
.Bd -literal -offset
root# scsi -f /dev/rsd0c -c "12 0 0 0 64 0" -i 64 "*b3 b5"
0
.Ed
.Pp
To do an inquiry to /dev/rsd2c:
.Bd -literal -offset
root# scsi -f /dev/rsd2c -c "12 0 0 0 64 0" -i 64 "s8 z8 z16 z4"
FUJITSU M2654S-512 010P
.Pp
To edit mode page 1 on /dev/rsd2c and store it permanently on the
drive (set AWRE and ARRE to 1 to enable bad block remapping):
.Bd -literal -offset
root# scsi -f /dev/rsd2c -m 1 -e -P 3
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev SU_DEBUG_OUTPUT
variable can be set to a file to send debugging
output to that file.
.Pp
The
.Ev SU_DEBUG_LEVEL
variable can be set to a non-zero integer to increase
the level of debugging.  Currently this is a on or off thing; it should
perhaps use the ioctl to set the debug level in the kernel and then set
it back to zero at program exit.
.Pp
The
.Ev SU_DEBUG_TRUNCATE
variable can be set to an integer to limit the
amount of data phase output sent to the debugging file.
.Pp
The
.Ev EDITOR
variable determines the editor to use for the mode editor.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr scsi 3 ,
.Xr scsi 4
.Sh BUGS
Some devices respond to an inquiry for all LUNS.  This will cause them
to come on line to 8 times during reprobe to different logical units.
"scsi -f /dev/rsd0c -c "4 0 0 0 0 0" permits anyone who can write to
.Pa /dev/rsd0c
to format the disk drive.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in 386BSD 0.1.2.4/FreeBSD to support the new reprobe
and user SCSI commands.
