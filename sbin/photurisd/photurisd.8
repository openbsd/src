.Dt PHOTURISD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm photurisd
.Nd IPSec key management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm photurisd
.Op Fl cvi
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon establishes security associations for encrypted
and/or authenticated network traffic.
.Pp
The daemon listens to a named pipe
.Pa photuris.pipe
for user requests and on a
.Dv PF_ENCAP
socket for kernel requests.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
The
.Fl c
option is used to force a primality check of the bootstrapped moduli.
.It Fl v
The
.Fl v
options is used to start
.Xr photurisd 8
in VPN (Virtual Private Network) mode, see
.Xr vpn 8 .
.It Fl i
The
.Fl i
option can be used to ignore the
.Pa photuris.startup
file.
Otherwise the exchanges in that file will be initiated on startup.
.It Fl d Ar directory
The
.Fl d
option specifies the
.Ar directory
in which
.Nm
looks for its startup files.
The default is
.Pa /etc/photuris/ .
.It Fl p Ar port
The
.Fl p
option specifies the local
.Ar port
the daemon shall bind to.
.El
.Pp
The file
.Pa photuris.conf
contains the moduli for the DH exchange and the actual exchange
schemes used to establish a shared secret.
The following keywords are understood:
.Bl -tag -width exchange -offset indent
.It Ic modulus
This keyword is followed by the numeric generator and modulus.
Those two values describe the group in which exchange values for the
.Dq Diffie-Hellmann
key exchange are generated.
The modulus needs to be a
.Dq safe prime .
.It Ic exchange
This keyword is used to specify the supported exchange schemes.
The scheme is
followed by either zero or the number of bits of the modulus to be used
with this scheme.
If zero is specified the given scheme acts as modifier to the base
scheme.
The base scheme is
.Dq DH_G_2_MD5
(generator of two and MD5 identification).
Extended schemes are
.Dq DH_G_2_DES_MD5
and
.Dq DH_G_2_3DES_SHA1 .
An exchange can only be configured if an apropriate modulus has be given
before.
.It Ic config
This is used to configure the LifeTimes of SPIs and exchanges.
The configurable values are:
.Ic exchange_max_retries ,
.Ic exchange_retransmit_timeout ,
.Ic exchange_timeout ,
.Ic exchange_lifetime
and
.Ic spi_lifetime .
They are followed by an integer.
.El
.Pp
The file
.Pa attributes.conf
contains the attributes, i.e., different choices of encryption
and authentication, offered to the other peer.
If a line starts with an ip
address and a space separated netmask the following attributes are only
offered to hosts lying in that net range.
Only one attribute per line is allowed.
An attribute can either be an already defined tag or
a new definition of an attribute.
In that case the line is followed by a comma-separated list:
.Ar attribute name ,
.Ar Photuris ID ,
.Ar type of attribute
and
.Ar key length .
The name is only used as reference.
A list of possible Photuris IDs can be found in
.Pa /usr/share/ipsec/attributes.conf .
The attribute type is one of the following:
.Dq enc ,
.Dq ident ,
.Dq auth
or
.Dq ident|auth .
The key length is so far only used by the encryption attributes and
specifies the number of keying bytes the daemon has to generate.
Predefined attributes are:
.Bl -tag -width AT_ESP_ATTRIB -offset indent
.It AT_AH_ATTRIB
Starts the list of authentication attributes.
.It AT_ESP_ATTRIB
Starts the list of encryption attributes.
.El
.Pp
The file
.Pa secrets.conf
contains the party preconfigured symmetric secrets for the
identity exchange.
.Bl -tag -width identity_pair_local -offset indent
.It Ic identity local
Defines the identity the local daemon will assume and the according
password.
Both name and secret are braced by quotation marks and follow the
.Ic identity local
directive.
.It Ic identity remote
Defines the parties the daemon can communicate with and their secrets.
Both name and secret are braced by quotation marks and follow the
.Ic identity remote
directive.
The name and secret are the same as the identity local on the remote site.
.It Ic identity pair local
If the identity of the remote site is already known,
.Ic identity pair local
enables the daemon to assume an identity and secret based on
the remote identity.
The directive is followed by the
remote identity, a new local identity and an according secret.
In that way the secrets are not shared with all other parties.
.El
.Pp
Once DNSSEC or other public key infrastructures are available, those will
be supported also.
.Pp
Finally the file
.Pa photuris.startup
contains parameters for exchanges which are created during
startup.
.Pp
The keywords
.Ic dst ,
.Ic port ,
.Ic options ,
.Ic tsrc ,
.Ic tdst ,
.Ic exchange_lifetime ,
.Ic spi_lifetime
and
.Ic user
are understood in the
.Pa photuris.startup
file.
The values are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width exchange_lifetime -offset indent
.It Ic dst
The destination IP address with which the exchange is to be established.
.It Ic port
The port number of the destination
.Nm
daemon.
.It Ic options
The options to be used in the exchange.
Possible values are
.Dq enc
and
.Dq auth .
.It Ic tsrc
If both
.Ic tsrc
and
.Ic tdst
(see below) are specified, a tunnel (IP over IP) is setup.
The
.Ic tsrc
option is a network address with netmask used for matching the source
IP address of a packet.
When both the source and the destination
addresses match their respective options the packet will be routed into the
tunnel.
.It Ic tdst
If both
.Ic tsrc
(see above) and
.Ic tdst
are specified, a tunnel (IP over IP) is setup.
The
.Ic tdst
option is a network address with netmask used for matching the destination
IP address of a packet.
When both the source and the destination
addresses match their respective options the packet will be routed into the
tunnel.
.It Ic exchange_lifetime
Determines the lifetime of the exchange.
After an exchange expires
no new SPIs are created, which means the transport or tunnel is torn down
as soon as the current SPI times out (see
.Ic spi_lifetime
below).
The default value is gotten from the
.Ic exchange_lifetime
parameter given in
.Pa photuris.conf .
If it is not given there the default is 1800 seconds.
.It Ic spi_lifetime
Determines the lifetime of each created SPI in the exchange.
.It Ic user
The user name for whom the keying shall be done.
Preconfigured secrets are taken from the users secret file.
.El
.Pp
Exchanges are separated by newlines.

.Pa photuris.startup
