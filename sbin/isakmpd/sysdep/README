If you got this isakmpd as part of the OpenBSD tree you won't find
system dependent files for other operating systems here.  In order to
find system dependent files for your favourite operating system, go to
ftp.gsnig.net or ftp.appli.se and visit pub/isakmpd.  In there you
will find an isakmpd distribution with support for other operating
systems as well as OpenBSD.  We chose not to ship these as part of the
OpenBSD tree as some of them are quite big.  Sorry for the
inconvenience.
