In order to find system dependent files for your favourite operating
system, go to ftp.gsnig.net or ftp.appli.se and visit pub/isakmpd.  In
there you will find packages for other systems isakmpd has been ported
to.  We chose not to ship these as part of the OpenBSD tree as some of
them are quite big.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
