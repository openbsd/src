Currently, you have to manually configure any IPsec interfaces and do the
association betweent these and the physical ones.  This is done like
this in FreeS/WAN:

ipsec tncfg --attach --virtual ipsec0 --physical eth0
ifconfig ipsec0 A.B.C.D netmask E.F.G.H

Then there is one special configuration option in the IPsec-connection
sections for Phase 2 of the configuration file, named Next-hop, which
should be set to the next hop's IP address along the way to the peer:

Next-hop=	I.J.K.L

This is specific to the way FreeS/WAN works.
