This is isakmpd, a BSD-licensed ISAKMP/Oakley (a.k.a. IKE)
implementation.  It's written by Niklas Hallqvist and Niels Provos,
funded by Ericsson Radio Systems AB.  Currently it is work in
progress, although it can be used for real setups.  It is not released,
thus I won't bother calling it any version numbers.  When you got the
source, hopefully the archive was named with a date which reflects when
it was created.  These archives are also known as snapshots and will be
created at irregular intervals and put up on ftp.gsnig.net and
ftp.appli.se in /pub/isakmpd.  From Nov 14, 1998 isakmpd is also
available in the OpenBSD main source tree under src/sbin/isakmpd,
though slightly modified for patent reasons, and because I don't want to
carry support files for other OSes in that distribution.  Look at
http://www.openbsd.org/ for details on how to get OpenBSD source.

Isakmpd is being developed under OpenBSD, with OpenBSD as its primary
target, however, a Linux effort has been started.  The makefile support
assumes a BSD environment noneheless as it is not too hard to get such
an environment to work under other operating systems.  For example,
Red Hat 5.2 ships with pmake installed.  Read sysdep/README for further
details about this issue.

First edit the Makefile in a manner you see fit.  Specifically the OS
define is important to get right of course.
Assuming you have an OpenBSD /usr/share/mk and use the OpenBSD (or
similar) make(1), you build isakmpd this way:

make obj && make depend && make

Then obj/isakmpd will be the daemon.  I suggest you try it by running
under gdb with args similar to:
	-d -n -p5000 -D0=99 -D1=99 -D2=99 -D3=99 -D4=99 -D5=99 \
	-f/tmp/isakmpd.fifo -csamples/VPN-east.conf

That will run isakmpd in the foreground, not connected to any application
(like an IPSEC implementation) logging to stderr with full debugging ouput,
listening on UDP port 5000, accepting control commands via the named pipe
called /tmp/isakmpd.fifo and reading its configuration from the
VPN-east.conf file (found in the isakmpd/samples directory).

If you are root you can try to run without -n -p5000 thus getting it to
talk to your IPSec stack and use the standard port 500 instead.

Read log.[ch] and ui.c to see how to alter the debugging levels.
Now you have setup your daemon and can watch incoming negotiations.
But how do you get such?  Either use http://isakmp-test.ssh.fi/,
there's an excellent service, just waiting for you.  Or you can try to
start another isakmpd on another port (say -p5001 or so, instead)
and another fifo (let's say /tmp/other.fifo).  Then edit the config
file to have some peer descriptions that fit your need and issue a
command like this:

$ echo "c IPsec-east-west" >/tmp/other.fifo

and watch.  You can turn on debugging on that isakmpd too of course, for
greater fun.

You may by now have noticed that this implementation is incomplete, but
who cares?  You are here because you want to read code, start porting work
or help us out fixing what need's to be fixed.

Happy IKEing!
