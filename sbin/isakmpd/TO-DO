This file is pretty lame as it should really contain a lot more given that
the program is far from ready in any area.

* Add debugging messages, maybe possible to control asynchronously. [done]

* Implement the local policy governing logging and notification of exceptional
  conditions.

* A field description mechanism used for things like making packet dumps
  readable etc.  Both Photurisd and Pluto does this. [done]

* Fix the cookies. <Niels> [done]

* Garbage collect transports (ref-counting?).

* Retransmission/dup packet handling. [done]

* Generic payload checks. [mostly done]

* For math, speed up multiplication and division functions.

* Cleanup of SAs when dropping messages. [done]

* Look over message resource tracking.

* Retransmission timing & count adaptivity and configurability.
  [configurability done]

* Quick mode exchanges [done]

* Aggressive mode exchange. <Niels>

* Finish main mode exchange [done]

* Separation of key exchange from the IPSEC DOI, i.e. factor out IKE details.

* Setup the IPSEC situation field in the main mode. [done]

* Kernel interface for IPSEC parameter passing. [done]

* Notify of unsupported situations.

* Set/get field macros generated from the field descriptions. [done]

* SIGHUP handler with reparsing of config file. [done]

* RSA signature authentication <Niels> [done]

* DSS signature authentication

* RSA encryption authentication

* New group mode

* DELETE payload handling, and generation from ui.

* Deal well with incoming informational exchanges.

* Generate all possible SA attributes in quick mode. [done]

* Validate incoming attribute according to policy, main mode.

* Validate incoming attribute according to policy, quick mode.

* Cleanup reserved SPIs on cleanup of associated SAs. [done]

* Validate attribute types (i.e. that what the specs tells should be
  basic).

* Cleanup reserved SPIs in proposals never chosen. [done]

* Add time measuring and reporting to the exchange code for catching of
  bottlenecks.

* Rescan interfaces on SIGHUP and on reception of messages on the INADDR_ANY
  listener socket.
