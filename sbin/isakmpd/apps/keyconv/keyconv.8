.Dt KEYCONV 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm keyconv
.Nd DNSSEC/OpenSSL private key converter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm keyconv
.Fl do
.Ar infile Ar outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility converts between the key formats used by OpenSSL, as produced by
.Xr openssl 1 ,
and DNSSEC, as produced by
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8 .
The primary use of
.Nm
is to generate the DNS "KEY" resource records that, when signed, can
be used by
.Xr isakmpd 8
to authenticate an IKE negotiation.
.Pp
For proper operation,
.Ar infile
is expected to contain the private key.
.Pp
The mode of operation is determined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width abc
.It Fl d
Convert from
.Pa DNSSEC
to
.Pa OpenSSL
format.
.It Fl o
Convert from
.Pa OpenSSL
to
.Pa DNSSEC
format.
In this mode,
.Nm
outputs both the private key, plus a
.Em outfile.pubkey
file containing the public key in DNS KEY format.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm dnssec-keygen
command is supplied as part of BIND version 8 and 9 and can currently
be found in the
.Ox
ports collection.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a new RSA key for usage both in
.Xr isakmpd 8
and DNSSEC.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
$ openssl genrsa -out testkey.ssl 1024
$ keyconv -d testkey.ssl testkey.dns
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr openssl 1 ,
.Xr isakmpd 8
.Sh HISTORY
This command first appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .
