.Dt KEYCONV 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm keyconv
.Nd DNSSEC/OpenSSL private key converter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm keyconv
.Fl d 
infile outfile
.Nm keyconv
.Fl o 
infile outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility converts between the key formats used by OpenSSL, as produced by
.Xr openssl 1 ,
and DNSSEC, as produced by
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8 .
The primary use of
.Nm
is to generate the DNS "KEY" resource records that, when signed, can
be used by
.Xr isakmpd 8
to authenticate an IKE negotiation.
.Pp
For proper operation, 
.Ar infile
is expected to contain the private key.
.Pp
The mode of operation is determined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width abcd
.It Fl d
Convert from DNSSEC to OpenSSL format.
.It Fl o
Convert from OpenSSL to DNSSEC format. In this mode, 
.Nm
outputs both the DNSSEC private key, plus a "outfile.pubkey"
file containing the public key in a format suitable for inclusion
in a DNS database file.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm dnssec-keygen
command is supplied as part of BIND version 8 and 9.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr isakmpd 8 ,
.Xr openssl 1 ,
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8
.Sh HISTORY
This command first appeared in
.Ox 
3.0.
