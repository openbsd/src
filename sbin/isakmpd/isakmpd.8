.Sh NAME
.Nm isakmpd
.Nd ISAKMP/Oakley aka IKE key management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm isakmpd
.Op Fl c Ar config-file
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl D Ar debug-class=level
.Op Fl f Ar fifo
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl p Ar listen-port
.Op Fl P Ar local-port
.Op Fl r Ar seed
.Op Fl R Ar report-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon establishes security associations for encrypted
and/or authenticated network traffic.
.Pp
The daemon listens to a named pipe
.Pa isakmpd.fifo
for user requests and on a
.Dv PF_ENCAP
socket for kernel requests.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar config-file
If given, the
.Fl c
option specifies an alternate configuration file instead of
.Pa /etc/isakmpd/isakmpd.conf .
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option is used to make the daemon run in the foreground, logging to stderr.
.It Xo Fl D
.Ar debug-class Ns No = Ns Ar level
.Xc
This argument is possible to specify many times.  It takes a parameter of
the form
.Ar class Ns No = Ns Ar level
where both
.Ar class
and
.Ar level
are numbers.
.Ar class
denotes a debugging class, and
.Ar level
the level you want that debugging class to
limit debug printouts at (i.e., all debug printouts above the level specified
will not output anything). If
.Ar class
is set to 'A',
then all debugging classes are set to the specified level.
.It Fl f Ar fifo
The
.Fl f
option specifies the
.Tn FIFO
(a.k.a. named pipe) where the daemon listens for
user requests.  If the path given is a dash
.Pq Sq \&- ,
.Nm
will listen to stdin instead.
.It Fl n
When the
.Fl n
option is given, the kernel will not take part in the negotiations.
This is a non-destructive mode so to say, in that it won't alter any
SAs in the IPSEC stack.
.It Fl p Ar listen-port
The
.Fl p
option specifies the listen port the daemon will bind to.
.It Fl P Ar local-port
On the other hand, the port specified to capital
.Fl P
will be what the daemon binds its local end to when acting as initiator.
.It Fl r Ar seed
If given a deterministic random number sequence will be used internally.
This is useful for setting up regression tests.
.It Fl R Ar report-file
When you signal
.Nm
a
.Dv SIGUSR1
it will report its internal state to a report file, normally
.Pa /var/run/isakmpd.report ,
but this can be changed by feeding
the file name as an argument to the
.Fl R
flag.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl P
flag does not do what we document, rather it does nothing.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/isakmpd.report
.It Pa /etc/isakmpd/isakmpd.conf
The configuration file
.It Pa /var/run/isakmpd.fifo
The FIFO used to manually control
.Nm isakmpd
.It Pa /var/run/isakmpd.report
The report file

.Sh HISTORY
The ISAKMP/Oakley key management protocol is described in the RFCs
.%T RFC 2407 ,
.%T RFC 2408
and
.%T RFC 2409 .
This implementation was done 1998 by Niklas Hallqvist and Niels Provos,
sponsored by Ericsson Radio Systems.
