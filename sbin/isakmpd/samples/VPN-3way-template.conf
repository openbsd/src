#
# A configuration sample for the isakmpd ISAKMP/Oakley (aka IKE) daemon.
#
# This is a template file of a VPN setup between three nodes in
# a fully meshed 'three-way' configuration. Suggested use is to copy
# this file to all three nodes and then edit them accordingly.
#
# These nodes are initially called XXX, YYY and ZZZ.
#
# In pseudographics:   XXX --- YYY
#                         \   /
#                          ZZZ
#
# In cases where IP/network addresses should be defined values like
# 192.168.XXX.nnn have been used.
#

# Incoming phase 1 negotiations are multiplexed on the source IP
# address. In the three-way VPN, we have two possible peers.

[Phase 1]
192.168.YYY.nnn=	ISAKMP-peer-node-YYY
192.168.ZZZ.nnn=	ISAKMP-peer-node-ZZZ

# These connections are walked over after config file parsing and
# told to the application layer so that it will inform us when
# traffic wants to pass over them.  This means we can do on-demand
# keying. In the three-way VPN, each node knows two connections.
