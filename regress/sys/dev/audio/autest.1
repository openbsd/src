.Sh NAME
.Nm autest
.Nd test audio encoding output
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm autest
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Fl r Ar rate
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility opens the
.Xr audio 4
device specified with the
.Fl f
flag
or
.Pa /dev/sound
if not specified,
and iterates through all of the encodings supported by the device playing
a 440Hz tone in the proper format.
The tone should sound almost identical in each of the formats.
The
.Fl r
rate
can be used to specify the audio rate to test, It will request the
audio subsystem to play that Hz, however the audio device may return
a different speed. This can be useful to test different speeds, eg 8000,
44100, 48000.
.Pp
.Nm
can produce tones in any of the following formats and will skip other
formats if supported by the device:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXX
.It Cm mu-law
8 bit mu-law companded
.It Cm A-law
8 bit A-law companded
.\" .It Cm adpcm
.\" 4 bit adaptive differential pulse code modulation
.It Cm ulinear
8 bit unsigned linear
.It Cm ulinear_le
16 bit unsigned linear little endian
.It Cm ulinear_be
16 bit unsigned linear big endian
.It Cm slinear
8 bit signed linear (twos complement)
.It Cm slinear_le
16 bit signed linear little endian (twos complement)
.It Cm slinear_be
16 bit signed linear big endian (twos complement)
.El
.Sh OUTPUT
Interpreting the output of
.Nm
is a little tricky.
The output below is from an
.Xr auich 4 .
.Bd -literal
ulinear:8...mono(s 44100 c 45167 e 2.4%)...stereo(s 44100 c 45162 e 2.4%)
mulaw:8*...mono(s 44100 c 45166 e 2.4%)...stereo(s 44100 c 45157 e 2.3%)
alaw:8*...mono[Invalid argument]...stereo[Invalid argument]
slinear:8*...mono(s 44100 c 45171 e 2.4%)...stereo(s 44100 c 45170 e 2.4%)
slinear_le:16...mono(s 44100 c 45171 e 2.4%)...stereo(s 44100 c 45170 e 2.4%)
ulinear_le:16*...mono(s 44100 c 45167 e 2.4%)...stereo(s 44100 c 45168 e 2.4%)
slinear_be:16*...mono(s 44100 c 45169 e 2.4%)...stereo(s 44100 c 45167 e 2.4%)
ulinear_be:16*...mono(s 44100 c 45167 e 2.4%)...stereo(s 44100 c 45160 e 2.3%)

.Pp
.Nm
loops through each mode claimed to be supported by the chip (emulated or not).
For each emulated mode, an asterisk is appended to the mode name.
If the tone sounds different from all the other tones for the device,
it is likely that either the emulation is wrong, or the mode is not
set on the device correctly.
.Pp
Also, for the mono and stereo versions of each mode,
.Nm
prints the claimed sample rate,
.So s Bo rate Bc Sc ,
computed sample rate,
.So c Bo rate Bc Sc ,
and the percent error between them,
.So e Bo percent Bc Sc .
If the percent error is high (greater than 10 percent or so),
either the sample rate is not being correctly returned by
the device, or it is not being set correctly on the device.
.Pp
Interestingly, when
.Nm
requests
.Sq alaw
encoding, the device driver returns
.So Invalid argument Sc .
This indicates that the device includes
.Sq alaw
in its mode enumeration, but does not support it for playback.
This is very likely a bug in the driver.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4
.Sh BUGS
There is partial support for ADPCM, adaptive differential pulse code
modulation, but it is not enabled by default
since it does not appear to be correct.
