.Sh NAME
.Nm autest
.Nd test audio encoding output
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm autest
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility opens
.Ar /dev/sound
and iterates through all of the encodings supported by the device playing
a 440Hz tone in the proper format.
The tone should sound almost identical in each of the formats.
.Pp
.Nm
can produce tones in any of the following formats and will skip other
formats if supported by the device:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXX
.It Cm mulaw
8bit U-Law companded
.It Cm alaw
8bit A-Law companded
.It Cm adpcm
4 bit adaptive differential pulse code modulation
.It Cm ulinear
8 bit unsigned linear.
.It Cm ulinear_le
16 bit unsigned linear little endian
.It Cm ulinear_be
16 bit unsigned linear big endian
.It Cm slinear
8 bit signed linear
.It Cm slinear_le
16 bit signed linear little endian
.It Cm slinear_be
16 bit signed linear big endian
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4
.Sh BUGS
The ADPCM encoding sounds very noisy on CS4231 (it's probaly incorrect).
