.Sh NAME
.Nm audiotest_gsinfo
.Nd test AUDIO_GETINFO and AUDIO_SETINFO
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm audiotest_gsinfo
.Bk -words
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command performs an
.Ar AUDIO_GETINFO
.Xr ioctl 2
to get the current
.Xr audio 4
settings, then uses these settings in an
.Ar AUDIO_SETINFO
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar device
The
.Xr audio 4
device to use.
It defaults to
.Pa /dev/audio .
.El
.Pp
.Nm
first checks that an
.Dv AUDIO_GETINFO
ioctl will succeed.
If it is not successful, it will exit with status 1.
.Pp
If it is successful,
.Nm
will perform an
.Dv AUDIO_SETINFO
ioctl, using the values in its
.Vt audio_info_t
argument that were received in the previous
.Dv AUDIO_GETINFO
ioctl.
If the
.Dv AUDIO_SETINFO
ioctl is successful,
.Nm
will exit with status 0.
.Pp
If the
.Dv AUDIO_SETINFO
ioctl is not successful,
.Nm
will perform an
.Dv AUDIO_SETINFO
ioctl using the default
.Vt audio_info_t
values as given by
.Dv AUDIO_INITINFO .
If this
.Dv AUDIO_SETINFO
is not successful,
.Nm
will exit with status 1.
.Pp
Otherwise,
.Nm
will run a series of
.Dv AUDIO_SETINFO
ioctls where a single field in the
.Vt audio_info_t
structure is set to values from the
.Dv AUDIO_GETINFO
ioctl, the other values being default.
As this series of ioctls is performed,
.Nm
will print the
.Vt audio_info_t
field that is using values from the
.Dv AUDIO_GETINFO
ioctl, as well as the value it is using.
If the ioctl fails,
.Nm
will print
.Dq <- ERROR
immediately following the value.
After all fields of the
.Vt audio_info_t
structure have been used,
.Nm
will exit with status 1.
