These tests must be run as root, on a system with free vnd0 and vnd1 slots.
The system must be single-user or set to a securelevel < 1 for all tests to
pass.
It is also advised that /mnt be unmounted, and clean.
The NFS tests create an entry in /etc/exports and start NFS server
daemons for a loopback mount.

The entry point to the file system tests is the run script, which takes a
list of tests scripts as arguments. The run script assumes that the current
directory is the root of the already mounted filesystem to be tested.

  Usage: run [file ...]

Each file is sourced by the run script and executed.

Not all filesystems support all VFS file system calls and the behvaviour of
the tests can be configured with environment variables.

CHFLAGS
        If this is "no", then any tests that rely on flags being implemented
        by the file system will not be run and instead check that
        EOPNOTSUPPORTED is returned by chflags(2).
