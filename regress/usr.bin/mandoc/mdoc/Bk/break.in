.Sh NAME
.Nm Bk-break
.Nd handling of word keeps
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Even though it is called a word keep,
.Bk -words
it will not keep words together in free-form text.
.Ek
However, even the noop macro
.Bk -words
.No is sufficient to let the keep take effect .
.Ek
Even text generated in pre-handlers must be kept together with
the text following it:
.Bk -words
.Xr one 1 No and Xr two 2
.Ek
should be on the same line.
.Pp
Including the whole output line into the keep is not required,
including just the macros to be kept together is sufficient:
