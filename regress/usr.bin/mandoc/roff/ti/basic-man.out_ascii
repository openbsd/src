     initial text
          This text is indented.  However, the indent is temporary, so as soon
     as the line wraps, it is gone.
               The temporary indent can be relative.  All the same, it will
     expire in the usual way.
  It is also possible to temporarily reduce the indentation, but that will
     also last until the next line break only.
Reducing by more than the current offset starts the next line at the physical
     left margin.
