     This is a longer text to demonstrate the default line length.  In ASCII
     mode, it is expected to break at column 78.

     This is another long text to
     demonstrate shorter lines.  In
     ASCII mode, it is expected to
     break at column 38.

     This is a longer text after switching back to the default line length.
     In ASCII mode, it is expected to break at column 78.

     This is another long text to demonstrate longer lines.  In ASCII mode, it is not expected to break at all.

     This is a longer text after switching to an invalid line length.  In
     ASCII mode, it is expected to break at column 78.

     This is another long text after reducing the line
     length (-18n).  In ASCII mode, it is expected to break
     at column 60.

     This is another long text after increasing the line length again (+18n).
     In ASCII mode, it is again expected to break at column 78.

     Now the line length was reduced using two signs
     (-+18n).  In ASCII mode, this paragraph is expected to
     break at column 60.

     Now the line length was increased using two signs (++18n).  In ASCII
     mode, this paragraph is expected to break at column 78.

     Now the line length was reduced using two signs in the
     opposite order (+-18n).  In ASCII mode, this paragraph
     is expected to break at column 60.

     Now the line length was increased using double minus (--18n).  In ASCII
     mode, this paragraph is expected to break at column 78.

     Now the line length was reduced using triple minus
     (---18n).  In ASCII mode, this paragraph is expected to
     break at column 60.

     And finally, the line length was increased using tree signs (-+-18n).  In
     ASCII mode, this paragraph is again expected to break at column 78.
