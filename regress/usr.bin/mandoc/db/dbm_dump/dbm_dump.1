.Dt DBM_DUMP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dbm_dump
.Nd dump a mandoc.db(5) file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm dbm_dump
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads a
.Xr mandoc_db 5
database from the given
.Ar file
and dumps it to the standard output in a format that is suitable for
.Xr diff 1 .
.Pp
Offsets are given in bytes, zero-based, and printed in hexadecimal numbers.
Counts are printed in decimal numbers.
.Pp
Each non-empty table - the PAGES table, the MACROS table, and any
MACRO table - is preceded and followed by a line beginning with
three equal signs
.Pq Sq === .
Empty tables produce no output.
.Pp
In the PAGES table, an entry may produce four or five lines of output,
depending on whether an
.Fa arch
value is present.
Each
.Fa name
value is preceded by one or more attributes in square brackets,
telling what kind of a name it is:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 1n -compact -offset indent
.It Sy f
a file name
.It Sy h
a header line name taken from a
.Ic \&Dt
or
.Ic \&TH
macro
.It Sy 1
the name from the first
.Ic \&Nm
macro in the NAME section
.It Sy t
a title name: a name from any
.Ic \&Nm
macro in the NAME section
.It Sy s
any name from a
.Ic \&Nm
macro in the SYNOPSIS section
.El
.Pp
In each MACRO table, macro values are followed by the primary name
of each page in which they occur.
This does not uniquely identify the pages because several pages
may share the same primary name.
.Sh FILES
The header files
.Qq Pa mansearch.h ,
.Qq Pa dbm_map.h ,
and
.Qq Pa dbm.h
and the object files
.Pa dbm_map.o
and
.Pa dbm.o
from the
.Xr mandoc 1
build are required to compile and link
.Nm .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
It fails when no argument or more than one argument is given or when
.Fn dbm_open
fails.
The pointer jumps described below
.Sx DIAGNOSTICS
do not imply failure.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Several examples of
.Nm
output can be found in the directory
.Pa /usr/src/regress/usr.bin/mandoc/db/out/ .
Standard output is saved in files with the extension
.Pa *.dout ,
standard error is collected in the file
.Pa all.derr .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The function
.Fn dbm_open
detects various kinds of issues with the file format
and reports them on the standard error output.
.Pp
Otherwise, the
.Nm
utility checks that the input file contains no holes
and that no pointers point backwards.
For each violation, the following message is printed:
.Pp
.D1 Ar pointer Sy jumps from Ar expected Sy to Ar specified
.Pp
Here,
.Ar pointer
specifies what the dubious pointer is supposed to point to:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width macros -compact
.It Sy name0
the primary name of the first page
.It Sy name
the primary name of another page
.It Sy sect0
the first section of the first page
.It Sy sect
the first section of another page
.It Sy arch0
the first architecture of the first architecture-specific page
.It Sy arch
the first architecture of another page
.It Sy desc0
the one-line description of the first page
.It Sy desc
the one-line description of another page
.It Sy file0
the first filename of the first page
.It Sy file
the first filename of another page
.It Sy macros
the number of macro tables
.It Sy macro0
the number of entries in the first macro table
.It Sy macro
the number of entries in another macro table
.It Sy value0
the first value of a macro
.It Sy value
another value of a macro
.It Sy pages0
the list of pointers to pages mentioning the first macro value
.It Sy pages
the list of pointers to pages mentioning another macro value
.It Sy end
the final magic
.El
.Pp
The hexadecimal 32-bit integers
.Ar expected
and
.Ar specified
give the byte offset of a specific data element in the file;
respectively, the one
.Ar expected
from the end of the preceding data in the file and the one actually
.Ar found
when reading the location where the pointer ought to be.
If
.Ar found
is greater than
.Ar expected ,
there is a hole, and the file could theoretically still be usable,
even though it is not likely to be correct.
If
.Ar found
is less than
.Ar expected ,
the file is corrupt because it contains a backward pointer.
