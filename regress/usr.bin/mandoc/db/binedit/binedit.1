.Sh NAME
.Nm binedit
.Nd non-interactive binary file editor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm binedit
.Ar command_string
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads a string of arbitrary bytes from the standard input,
edits it according to the
.Ar command_string ,
and writes the resulting string of bytes to the standard output.
.Pp
The
.Ar command_string
consists of an arbitrary number of one-letter commands.
Some commands take a numeric argument.
No delimiters are used.
.Pp
Commands use two number registers:
A
.Va value
set by
.Ic r
and
.Ic w ,
modfied by
.Ic i ,
and used by
.Ic d ,
and a
.Va destination
set by
.Ic d
and used by
.Ic a .
.Pp
All numbers are signed 32-bit integers.
On the command line, they are given in decimal notation,
optionally preceded by a sign.
In the input and output streams, they are represented in
big endian (network) byte order.
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic a
Advance: copy bytes up to and including the input
.Va destination
set with the
.Ic d
command.
.It Ic c Ar bytes
Copy the specified number of
.Ar bytes .
.It Ic d
Set the input file
.Va destination
to the saved
.Va value .
Bytes are counted from 1.
.It Ic f
Finish: copy all remaining bytes.
This command can only appear once at the end of the
.Ar command_string .
.It Ic i Op Ar amount
Increment the saved
.Va value
by the given
.Ar amount ,
by default 1.
.It Ic r
Read one number from the standard input and save the
.Va value .
.It Ic s Ar bytes
Skip the specified number of
.Ar bytes
on the standard input.
.It Ic w Op Ar value
Write the given
.Ar value
and also save it.
If no argument is given, the saved
.Va value
is written.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
See the file
.Pa /usr/src/regress/usr.bin/mandoc/db/run/Makefile
for several examples.
For example, with the
.Ar command_string
.Ic c12rdwariwf ,
.Nm
reads a valid
.Xr mandoc_db 5
file from the standard input and prints a corrupted version to the
standard output where the final magic is incremented by one.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are formatted as follows:
.Pp
.D1 Ar command : message Ns Op Ns : Ar errno_message
.Pp
The
.Ar message
strings are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar command : Sy EOF
The input file ended prematurely.
Can occur during the
.Ic a ,
.Ic c ,
.Ic r ,
and
.Ic s
commands.
.It Ar command : Sy getchar : Ar errno_message
The
.Xr getchar 3
function failed.
Can occur during the
.Ic a ,
.Ic c ,
.Ic f ,
and
.Ic s
commands.
.It Ic r : Sy fread : Ar errno_message
The
.Xr fread 3
function failed while processing an
.Ic r
command.
.It Ic w : Sy fwrite : Ar errno_message
The
.Xr fwrite 3
function failed while processing a
.Ic w
command.
.It Ic f Ns ... : Sy not the last command
An
.Ic f
command was encountered before the end of the
.Ar command_string .
.It Ar command : Sy invalid command
An invalid byte was found in the
.Ar command_string ,
or an argument was given after a command that does not accept one.
