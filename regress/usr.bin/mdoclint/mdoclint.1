.Sh NAME
.Nm mdoclint
.Nd man page verifier
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Fhmpvx
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a man page verifier.
It tries to automatically find as many common
errors that occur when writing man pages as possible.
If no flags are given,
.Fl mpx
is assumed (that is, everything except
.Fl Fhv ) .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl F
Delete whitespace at the end of input lines.
.It Fl h
Display usage.
.It Fl m
Warn if man page is not in
.Xr mdoc 7
format.
.It Fl p
Warn about abuse of .Ns to get punctuation directly next to a word.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
.It Fl x
Warn about cross-references whose target is missing, cross-references
to itself, or plain bogus cross-references.
.Pp
For
.Dq .Xr name X ,
the following files are checked:
.Pa /usr/share/man/manX/name.X ,
.Pa /usr/share/man/manX/`uname -m`/name.X ,
.Pa ./name.X ,
and
.Pa /usr/X11R6/man/manX/name.X .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mdoc 7
.Sh HISTORY

.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Ox 4.5 .

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl p
flag currently produces too many bogus warnings.
.Pp
The
.Fl x
flag sometimes erroneously warns about xrefs to man pages for
machine-dependent drivers that are not for the architecture
.Nm
is running on.
