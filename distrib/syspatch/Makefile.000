# A helper target called `findstatic' is available so that a list of
# directories can be created. `make -f Makefile.000 LIB=util findstatic'
# will give a list of directories that have to be added to SUBDIR because
# they statically link libutil.
# This is a best-guess function so a manual check is always necessary.
