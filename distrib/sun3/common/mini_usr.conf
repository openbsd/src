# The only real purpose of this crunched binary is to
# provide statically linked versions of some programs
# that would normally reside in usr/bin or usr/sbin.
# A few related ones are thrown in to save space:
#   chgrp, rcp
#
# Many others were kept separate, somewhat arbitrarily,
# but mostly things that are somewhat large, or that are
# normally used separately, or have weird make rules...
