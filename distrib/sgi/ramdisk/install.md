An SGI Volume Header was found on the disk. Normally you want to replace it
with a new Volume Header suitable for installing OpenBSD. Doing this will

If the Volume Header was installed by a previous OpenBSD install keeping
it is OK as long as the Volume Header has room for the 'boot' program.
If you are trying to keep an old IRIX Volume Header, OpenBSD install will
use the 'a' partition on the disk for the install and any data in that
partition will be lost.

You will now create an OpenBSD disklabel. The disklabel must have an
'a' partition, being the space available for OpenBSD's root file system.
The 'p' partition must be retained since it contains the SGI Volume Header;
this in turn contains the boot loader. No other partitions should overlap
with the SGI Volume Header, which by default will use the first 3134 sectors.

Do not change any parameters except the partition layout and the label name.
