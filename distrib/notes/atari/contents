There are three atari floppy images to be found in the "atari/floppies"
subdirectory of the OpenBSD OSREV distribution.  One of them is a
bootable TOS kernel floppy and the other two are installation floppy's.
They are described in more detail below.  There are gzipped versions
of each available, for easier downloading.  (The gzipped version
have the ".gz" extension added to their names.)

Bootable Kernel floppy:

	This TOS disk contains the loadbsd and chg_part programs
	and the GENERIC kernel.  It is setup so that you can insert it
	into your floppy drive, and start the programs from GEM.

	This floppy is named boot-OSrev.fs

Installation floppy:

	This disk contains a BSD root file system setup to help
	you install the rest of OpenBSD.  This includes formatting
	and mounting your root and /usr partitions and getting
	ready to extract (and possibly first fetching) the distribution
	sets.  There is enough on this file system to allow you to
	make a slip connection, configure an ethernet, mount an NFS
	file system or ftp.  You can also load distribution sets from
	a SCSI tape or from one of your existing TOS partitions.

	This floppy's are named "inst-OSrev.fs.1" and "inst-OSrev.fs.2".
