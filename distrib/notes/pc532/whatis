For the pc532 port, there are a few known problems.  They {:-include-:}:

  a) ppp reports a lot of input errors on some machines.

  b) Some tape drives do not work very well.  Some have hung the system.

  c) The serial drivers do not have all the desired features.  (ttyflags
	is the most glaring.)

  d) The disk driver is polled, not interrupt driven.
