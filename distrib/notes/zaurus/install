OpenBSDInstallPrelude

OpenBSD is installed on the Zaurus by effectively converting
Linux into a boatloader.  You will need the following files
from the distribution:

	zbsdmod.o
	zboot
	bsd.rd

After starting up some sort of terminal emulator on the Zaurus
and becoming root, perform the following operation:

	# insmod -f zbsdmod.o
	# cp bsd.rd /proc/zboot

A few seconds later, OpenBSD will boot on your Zaurus.

If you already have a bsd.rd or bsd kernel contained in a FFS
partition on the C3000 hard drive, you can instead use 

	# insmod -f zbsdmod.o
	# zboot

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  You should just
	hit return to select the default (vt220).

	Next you will have to edit or create a disk label for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  If there are any existing
	partitions defined (for any operating system), and a disk label
	is not found, you will first be given an opportunity to run
	fdisk and create an OpenBSD partition.

	If fdisk is being invoked on your behalf, it will start by
	displaying the current partitions defined and then allow you
	to modify this information, add new partitions and change
	which partition to boot from by default.  If you make a mistake,
	you will be allowed to repeat this procedure as necessary to
	correct this.  Note that you should make OpenBSD be the active
	partition at least until the install has been completed.

OpenBSDInstallPart4({:- If you have Linux partitions
	defined on the disk, these will usually show up as partition
	'h', 'i' and so on.-:})

	One of the three partitions on the Zaurus C3000 hard drive is
	a 3GB MSDOS filesystem.  This partition can be a lot smaller,
	it is therefore recommended that you cut most of the space off
	this tiny MSDOS partition, and create a new 0xA5 partition
	afterwards, like this:

	 0: 83    0   3 13 - 1511   7 17 [          63:      205569 ] Linux files*
	 1: 83 1512   0  1 - 7559   7 17 [      205632:      822528 ] Linux files*
	 2: 0C 7560   0  1 - 9065   7  1 [     1028160:      204800 ] Win95 FAT32L
	 3: A6 9065   7  2 - 67885   5  3 [     1232960:     7999488 ] OpenBSD     

	After shrinking the MSDOS partition, please be sure to newfs it
	using:

		newfs -t msdos /dev/rwd0k

	Note that all OpenBSD partitions in the disk label must have an
	offset that makes it start within the OpenBSD part of the disk,
	and a size that keeps it inside of that portion of the disk.  This
	is within the bounds of the 'c' partition if the disk is not being
	shared with other operating systems, and within the OpenBSD fdisk
	partition if the disk is being shared.

	For purposes of recovery in case Linux becomes inoperable for
	one reason or another with HDD1 Errors and such, we detail the
	process to come up single user:

		Remove power and the battery.
		Begin holding down the 'b' and 'd' keys.
		Wait for 1 minute.
		Insert battery and power on unit.
		As soon as a login screen starts to show up, release the 'b'
		and 'd' keys.
		Login as root.

	The following sequence is also recommended inside Linux so that
	problems will happen less often.  By default the boot scripts fail
	if the MSDOS partition is corrupt in any way.  If you are already
	root do the following, which will skip mounting the MSDOS partition.

		Login as root.

		Find the rc.rofilesys file.  It is either in
		/root/etc/rc.d

			cd /root/home/etc/rc.d

		Or you have to mount it using:

			mount /dev/mtdblock2 /mnt
			cd /mnt/home/etc/rc.d

		cat rc.rofilesys | sed -e '/vfat/s/^/#/' > vfat
		diff -u rc.rofilesys vfat		# to double check
		cp rc.rofilesys rc.rofilesys.vfat
		cp vfat rc.rofilesys
		
	In these cases below we avoid using vi because Linux quality is of
	such high quality that vi locks up the console.  If you logged in
	multiuser you may be able to use vi.

	Please be aware that if you fsck the two Linux partitions on
	the disk, they are actually ext3fs partitions and you will thereby
	corrupt their journals.  This will make them into ext2fs partitions.
	Linux will not be able to boot, and you will need to use the
	processes above to get to the point where Linux will mount them as
	ext2fs partitions:

		Login as root.

		Find the rc.rofilesys file.  It is either in
		/root/etc/rc.d

			cd /root/home/etc/rc.d

		Or you have to mount it using:

			mount /dev/mtdblock2 /mnt
			cd /mnt/home/etc/rc.d

		cat rc.rofilesys | sed -e '/^LINUXFMT=ext3$/s/^/#/' \
			-e '/^#LINUXFMT=ext2$/s/^#//' > ext2
		diff -u rc.rofilesys ext2		# to double check
		cp rc.rofilesys rc.rofilesys.ext2
		cp ext2 rc.rofilesys

	If you have created an 'A5' OpenBSD partition earlier using fdisk,
	you will be able to use disklabel to cut that partition into at
	least a root filesystem and swap partition.
