Due to the change in binary format from a.out to ELF in OpenBSD OSREV,
upgrades, albeit possible, are very tricky.  The best solution, whenever
possible, is to backup your data and reinstall from scratch.

The two main hurdles in the upgrade from an a.out system to an ELF OpenBSD
OSREV system are:
- the a.out binary emulation, required for compatibility with a.out
  binaries using shared libraries, is not enabled by default, and requires
  an explicit configuration change.
- a.out shared libraries (lib*.so) need to be moved to a specific location
  for proper operation of older binaries.

Before you start the upgrade process, the a.out emulation area needs to be
setup. It needs to be put inside a /emul/a.out hierarchy. This directory can,
however, be a symbolic link, should the available space in the root partition
not be enough.

The /emul/a.out should be populated by the a.out shared libraries.
An easy way to do it is to run the following commands as root:

   mkdir -p /emul/a.out/sbin /emul/a.out/var/run
   tar cf - `/sbin/ldconfig -r | awk '/=>/ { print $3 }'` |
       tar -C /emul/a.out -xpf -
   cp -p /sbin/ldconfig /emul/a.out/sbin

Then, a cache of these shared libraries must be generated with:

   cp /var/run/ld.so.hints /var/run/ld.so.hints.backup
   for lib in `/sbin/ldconfig -r |
       awk '/=>/ { printf("/emul/a.out%s\n", $3"); }'`;
   do
       dirname $lib;
   done | sort | uniq > /root/a.out-newlibdirs
   /sbin/ldconfig -s `cat /root/a.out-newlibdirs`
   /bin/mv /var/run/ld.so.hints /emul/a.out/var/run
   /bin/mv /var/run/ld.so.hints.backups /var/run/ld.so.hints
   rm -f /root/a.out-newlibdirs

Finally, it is a good idea to keep a list of the various shared libraries
which have been copied to the /emul/a.out hierarchy, as they will need to
be removed after the upgrade is completed:

  /sbin/ldconfig -r | awk '/=>/ { print $3 }' > /root/a.out-sharedlibs

The last step before the upgrade is to enable the a.out emulation, in
order to be sure that /etc/rc.local or any other customization you have
made to the system will still run:

  echo "kern.emul.aout=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf

The upgrade is now possible. Boot from the CD-ROM or an installation
floppy, as you would do for a new installation. 

When prompted, select the (U)pgrade option rather than the (I)nstall
option at the prompt in the install process.

The upgrade script will ask you for the existing root partition, and
will use the existing filesystems defined in /etc/fstab to install the
new system in.  It will also use your existing network parameters.

From then, the upgrade procedure is very close to the installation
procedure described earlier in this document.  Note that the upgrade
procedure will not let you pick the ``etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz'' set, so as to
preserve your files in `/etc' which you are likely to have customized
since a previous installation.

When the upgrade procedure tells you that the upgrade is complete, do not
reboot the system yet.

However, it is strongly advised that you unpack the etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz set in
a temporary directory and merge changes by hand, since all components of
your system may not function correctly until your files in `/etc' are
updated.

After the upgrade is completed, it is now possible to remove the old a.out
shared libraries from their initial locations:

  rm -f `cat /root/a.out-sharedlibs`
  rm -f /root/a.out-sharedlibs
