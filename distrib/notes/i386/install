OpenBSDInstallPrelude

If OpenBSD will be sharing the disk with DOS or another operating
system, you should have already completed the section of these notes
that instructed you on how to prepare your hard disk.  You should know
the size of the OpenBSD area of the disk and its offset from the
beginning of the disk.  You will need this information when setting up
your OpenBSD partitions.  If you BIOS uses translated geometry, you
should use this geometry for the remainder of the install.  This is
only necessary if you are sharing the disk with other operating systems
that use the translated geometry.

	Boot your machine using the floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs floppy.  When
	presented with the boot prompt hit return.  If the boot prompt
	does not appear in a reasonable amount of time, you either
	have a bad boot floppy or a hardware problem.  Try writing the
	floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs floppy image to a different disk, and using that.
	If that doesn't work, try booting after disabling your CPU's
	internal and external caches (if any).  If it still doesn't
	work, OpenBSD probably can't be run on your hardware.  This can
	probably be considered a bug, so you might want to report it.
	If you do, please {:-include-:} as many details about your system
	configuration as you can.

	It will take a while to load the kernel from the floppy,
	most likely more than a minute.  If some action doesn't
	eventually happen, or the spinning cursor has stopped and
	nothing further has happened, either your boot floppy is
	bad or you are having hardware problems, and should proceed
	as outlined above.

OpenBSDBootMsgs

	While booting, you will probably see several warnings.  You
	should be warned that no swap space is present, and that
	init(8) cannot find /etc/rc.  Do not be alarmed, these are
	completely normal.  When you reach the prompt asking you for a
	shell name, just hit return.

	Now you will be asked whether you wish to do an "install"
	or an "upgrade".  Enter 'i' for a fresh install or 'u' to
	upgrade an existing installation.

	You will be presented with a welcome message and asked if
	you really wish to install (or upgrade).  Assuming you
	answered yes, you will be asked which terminal type to use.
	You should just hit return to select the default (pcvt25).

	The install program will then tell you which disks of that
	type it can install on, and ask you which it should use.  The
	name of the disk is typically "wd0" for IDE/RLL/ESDI/ST506
	drives or "sd0" for SCSI drives.  Reply with the name of your
	disk.

	Next you will have to edit or create a disk label for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  If there are any existing
	partitions defined (for any operating system), and a disk label
	is not found, you will first be given an opportunity to run
	fdisk and create an OpenBSD partition.

	If fdisk is being invoked on your behalf, it will start by
	displaying the current partitions defined and then allow you
	to modify this information, add new partitions and change
	which partition to boot from by default.  If you make a mistake,
	you will be allowed to repeat this procedure as necessary to
	correct this.  Note that you should make OpenBSD be the active
	partition at least until the install has been completed.

	Next the disk label which defines the layout of the OpenBSD
	file systems must be set up.  The installation script will
	invoke an interactive editor allowing you to do this.  Note
	that partition 'c' inside this disk label should ALWAYS
	reflect the entire disk, including any non-OpenBSD portions.
	If you are labeling a new disk, you will probably start
	out with an 'a' partition that spans the disk.  In this case
	You should delete 'a' before adding new partitions.
	The root file system should be in partition 'a', and swap
	is usually in partition 'b'.  If you have DOS or Linux
	partitions defined on the disk, these will usually show up
	as partition 'h', 'i' and so on.  It is recommended that
	you create separate partitions for /usr, /tmp, and /var, and
	if you have room for it, one for /home.  In doing this, remember
	to skip 'c', leaving it as type "unused".  Create your next
	partition as 'd' and continue from there with any additional
	partitions.  If you have DOS or Linux partitions defined on the
	disk, these will usually show up as partition 'h', 'i', and
	so on.

	When you are finished with disklabel you will be prompted for
	the mount points for the partitions in the current label.
	For help in the disk label editor, enter '?' or 'M' to view
	the manual page (see the info on the ``-E'' flag).

	Note that all OpenBSD partitions in the disk label must have an
	offset that makes it start within the OpenBSD part of the disk,
	and a size that keeps it inside of that portion of the disk.  This
	is within the bounds of the 'c' partition if the disk is not being
	shared with other operating systems, and within the OpenBSD fdisk
	partition if the disk is being shared.

	The swap partition (usually 'b') should have a type of "swap", all
	other native OpenBSD partitions should have a type of "4.2BSD".
	Block and fragment sizes are usually 8192 and 1024 bytes, but can
	also be 4096 and 512 or even 16384 and 2048 bytes.

	The install program will now label your disk and ask which file
	systems should be created on which partitions.  It will auto-
	matically select the 'a' partition to be the root file system.
	Next it will ask for which disk and partition you want a file
	system created on.  This will be the same as the disk name (eg.
	"wd0") with the letter identifying the partition (eg. "d")
	appended (eg. "wd0d").  Then it will ask where this partition is
	to be mounted, eg. /usr.  This process will be repeated until
	you enter "done".

	At this point you will be asked to confirm that the file system
	information you have entered is correct, and given an opportunity
	to change the file system table.  Next it will create the new file
	systems as specified, OVERWRITING ANY EXISTING DATA.  This is the
	point of no return.

	After all your file systems have been created, the install program
	will give you an opportunity to configure the network.  The network
	configuration you enter (if any) can then be used to do the install
	from another system using NFS, HTTP or FTP, and will also be the
	configuration used by the system after the installation is complete.

	If you select to configure the network, the install program will
	ask you for a name of your system and the DNS domain name to use.
	Note that the host name should be without the domain part, and that
	the domain name should NOT {:-include-:} the host name part.

	Next the system will give you a list of network interfaces you can
	configure.  For each network interface you select to configure, it
	will ask for the IP address to use, the symbolic host name to use,
	the netmask to use and any interface-specific flags to set.  The
	interface-specific flags are usually used to determine which media
	the network card is to use.  The flags usually carry the following
	meaning:

		-link0 -link1	Use BNC (coaxial) port [default]
		link0 -link1	Use AUI port
		link0 link1	Use UTP (twisted pair) port

	After all network interfaces has been configured the install pro-
	gram will ask for a default route and IP address of the primary
	name server to use.  You will also be presented with an opportunity
	to edit the host table.

	At this point you will be allowed to edit the file system table
	that will be used for the remainder of the installation and that
	will be used by the finished system, following which the new file
	systems will be mounted to complete the installation.

	After these preparatory steps has been completed, you will be
	able to extract the distribution sets onto your system.  There
	are several install methods supported; FTP, HTTP, tape, CD-ROM, NFS
	or a local disk partition.  To install from a tape, the distrib-
	ution sets must have been written to tape prior to running the
	installation program, either as tar images or as gzipped tar
	images.  Note that installation from floppies is not currently
	supported.
