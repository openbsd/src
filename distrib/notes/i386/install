If OpenBSD will be sharing the disk with DOS or another operating
system, you should have already completed the section of these notes
that instructed you on how to prepare your hard disk.  You should know
the size of the OpenBSD area of the disk and its offset from the
beginning of the disk.  You will need this information when setting up
your OpenBSD partitions.  If your BIOS uses translated geometry, you
should use this geometry for the remainder of the install.  This is
only necessary if you are sharing the disk with other operating systems
that use the translated geometry.

There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk.  The easiest way,
should your computer support it, is to boot off the OpenBSD CD-ROM, or
off one of the bootable CD-ROM mini images.  Otherwise, you can boot
from a 3.5" 1.44MB floppy disk if your machine has a floppy drive.
If your machine supports PXE network boots, you could try to configure a
server for a network install.

	If you are using CD-ROM or floppy media, ensure the disk is in
	the drive before starting.

	Reboot the computer to begin the install.  You might have to play
	with your BIOS options to get the computer to boot from the
	correct installation media (floppy, CD, or network/PXE) rather
	than from the hard disk.

	If you are installing across the network with PXE, you will need
	to tell pxeboot to get the bsd.rd install kernel:

	    boot> boot bsd.rd

	It can take a while to load the kernel from a floppy, slow speed
	CD-ROM drive, or across a network, most likely more than a minute.
	If some action doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor
	has stopped and nothing further has happened, either your boot
	floppy is bad or you are having hardware problems. If trying
	another floppy disk doesn't help, try booting after disabling your
	CPU's internal and external caches (if any).  If it still doesn't
	work, OpenBSD probably can't be run on your hardware.  This can
	probably be considered a bug, so you might want to report it.  If
	you do, please {:-include-:} as many details about your system
	configuration as you can.

	Next you will have to edit or create a disk label for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  If there are any existing
	partitions defined (for any operating system), and a disk label
	is not found, you will first be given an opportunity to run
	fdisk and create an OpenBSD partition.

	If fdisk is being invoked on your behalf, it will start by
	displaying the current partitions defined and then allow you
	to modify this information, add new partitions, and change
	which partition to boot from by default.  If you make a mistake,
	you will be allowed to repeat this procedure as necessary to
	correct this.  Note that you should make OpenBSD be the active
	partition at least until the install has been completed.

	If you have DOS or Linux partitions defined on the disk, these
	will usually show up as partition 'i', 'j' and so on.-:})
