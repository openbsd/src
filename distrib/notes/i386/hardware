NetBSD/i386 1.0 runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors.  It
does NOT support MCA systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems.  The
minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and 40M of disk space.  To
install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run X
or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (4M of RAM will
actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it won't be speedy.
Note that until you have around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.)

Supported devices include:
	Floppy controllers.
	MFM, ESDI, IDE, and RLL hard disk controllers.
	SCSI host adapters:
		Adaptec AHA-154xA, -B, -C, and -CF [only on kcaha floppy]
		Adaptec AHA-174x
		Adaptec AIC-6260- and AIC-6360-based boards, including
			the Adaptec AHA-152x and the SoundBlaster SCSI
			host adapter.  (Note that you cannot boot from
			these boards if they do not have a boot ROM,
			and many do not.)
		Buslogic 54x [AHA-154x clones; only on kcaha floppy]
		Buslogic 445, 74x, 9xx [only on kcbt floppy]
		NCR 53C810 PCI SCSI host adapter
		Ultrastor 14f, 34f, and (possibly) 24f
	MDA, CGA, VGA, SVGA, and HGC Display Adapters.  (Note that not
		all of the display adapters NetBSD/i386 can work with
		are supported by X.  See the XFree86 FAQ for more
		information.)
	Serial ports:
		8250/16450-based ports
		16550-based ports
		AST-style 4-port serial boards [*]
		IBM PC-RT 4-port serial boards [*]
	Parallel ports.
	Ethernet controllers:
		AT&T StarLAN 10, EN100, and StarLAN Fiber
		3COM 3c501 [*]
		3COM 3c503
		3COM 3c505 [*]
		3COM 3c507
		3COM 3c509 and 3c579
		Digital DEPCA [*]
		BICC Isolan [* and not recently tested]
		SMC/WD 8003, 8013, and the SMC "Elite16" ISA boards
		SMC/WD 8216 (the SMC "Elite16 Ultra" ISA boards)
		Novell NE1000, NE2000
		Novell NE2100 [* and not recently tested]
	Tape drives:
		Most SCSI tape drives
		QIC-02 and QIC-36 format (Archive- and Wangtek-
			compatible) tape drives [*]
	CD-ROM drives:
		Mitsumi CD-ROM drives [*]
		Most SCSI CD-ROM drives
	Mice:
		"Logitech"-style bus mice [*]
		"Microsoft"-style bus mice [*]
		"PS/2"-style mice [*]
		Serial mice (no kernel support necessary)
	Miscellaneous:
		SoundBlaster [*]

Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT included on the
distribution floppies.  Except as noted above, all other drivers are
present on both kernel-copy disks.  Also, at the present time, the
distributed kernels support only one SCSI host adapter per machine.
NetBSD normally allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you
can use all of them by compiling a custom kernel once NetBSD is
installed.

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	Adaptec AIC-7770-based SCSI host adapters (including the
		Adaptec AHA-274x, AHA-284x, and AHA-294x families).
	Intel EtherExpress Ethernet boards.
	NCR 5380-based SCSI host adapters.
	PCMCIA devices.
	QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives.  (Those are the tape drives
		that connect to the floppy disk controller.)
	WD-7000 SCSI host adapters.

We are planning future support for most of these devices.

To be detected by the distributed kernels, the devices must
be configured as follows:
