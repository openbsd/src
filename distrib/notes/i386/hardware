dnl	$OpenBSD: hardware,v 1.100 2003/01/13 13:53:05 henning Exp $
OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV works across a broad range of standard PC's and
clones, with a wide variety of processors and I/O bus architectures.  It
can be expected to install and run with minimal difficulties on most
current products.  The cases where problems may be encountered are
typically older proprietary PC's, laptops or specialized server boxes
that rely on a custom BIOS to paper over implementation differences.

OpenBSD does not currently support multiple processors (SMP), but will
run using one processor on a multi-processor system board.

The minimal configuration to install the system is 12M or 16M of RAM and
perhaps 100M of disk space.  A custom kernel might be able to run with only
8MB.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (16M of RAM will actually
allow you to run X and/or compile but it won't be speedy. Note that until
you have around 32M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting
a faster CPU.)

Supported hardware {:-include-:}:
	Processors
		All CPU chips compatible with the Intel 80386 (MACHINE)
		architecture:
			386/486 (SX/DX/DX2/DX4)
			Intel Pentium/Pentium-MMX
			Intel Pentium Pro/II/III/Celeron/Xeon
			Intel Pentium IV
			AMD 6x86
			AMD K5/K6/K6-2/K6-3
			AMD Athlon/Duron
			Cyrix MediaGX/M1/M2
			VIA Cyrix III
			Rise mP6
			IDT WinChip
			NexGen 586
			NS Geode GX1
			Transmeta TMS3200, TMS5400, TMS5600
		Everything that is a clone of the 386 or up should work
		fine. The only CPU that is known to work poorly (due to
		flawed motherboards designs) is the Cyrix 386DLC.
	Buses
		All standard ISA, EISA, VLB, and PCI bus based machines,
		including:
			Intel 450GX/KX based machines
			Intel 450NX based machines
			ServerWorks chipset-based machines
			(We just had to mention those last three, since
			 they are the hardest to support)
		Both 16-bit PCMCIA Cards and newer 32-bit CardBus
		support
		Universal Serial Bus (USB)
		The MCA bus found in various IBM PS/2 machines is not
		supported.
	Bus Interfaces
		Standard PCI-PCI bridges, including PCI expansion
		backplanes
		YENTA-compatible PCI-CardBus bridges
	Entropy Sources
		Interrupt latency collection from many devices
		Intel 82802 random number generator found on i810, i815,
		i820, i840, i850 and i860 based systems.
	Disk Controllers
		Floppy controllers.
		ISA MFM, ESDI, IDE, and RLL hard disk controllers.
	PCI IDE Controllers

		Contaq Microsytems/Cypress CY82C693
		HighPoint HPT366, HPT370, HPT372, HPT374 (as IDE interfaces,
		    not RAID controllers)

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	The "Micro Channel" MCA bus used in many IBM PS/2 models
	NCR 5380-based and 53400-based SCSI host adapters
	QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives (these are the tape drives
		that connect to the floppy disk controller)
	Multiprocessor motherboards (though they will run fine using
		one processor only)
	Sony and Panasonic proprietary CD-ROM interfaces
	Parallel-port ZIP drives (SCSI and ATAPI ZIP drives work fine)
	Intel i82556 (EtherExpress PRO/100A) and i82596 (EtherExpress
		PRO/10 PCI) Ethernet adapters
	Hewlett-Packard PC-LAN+ (HP27xxx) Ethernet adapters
	Aureal Vortex sound cards
	Winmodems
	Infrared devices, such as commonly found on laptops
	Firewire
	Mylex and Intel RAID controllers
	PCMCIA:
		Memory cards
		Most multifunction cards

We are planning future support for many of these devices.

be configured with specific settings.  Here's their list:

PCI ethernet boards need to have an interrupt, either assigned in your
PCI BIOS, or autoconfigured.

Hardware not listed in the above table doesn't need any specific
configuration.


Special care for SMC Elite Ultra:

	The Elite Ultra is very sensitive to how its I/O port is treated.
	Mistreating it can cause a number of effects -- everything from
	the card not responding when the kernel probes, or the soft
	configuration being corrupted or wiped completely.

	By default, the kernel ships with device we1 configured for the
	'default' Elite Ultra locations, comprising of port 0x300, irq 10,
	and memory location 0xcc000.  This matches a hard coded jumper on
	the board as well a common soft config setting.

	Unfortunately, the kernel's autoconfiguration process (specifically,
	some of the devices it probes for) cause conflicts with the SMC
	Elite Ultra, and very often cause it to lose its configuration and
	fail its own probe.  If this happens, you must boot the computer
	into DOS, and run the EzSetup program from SMC (if you do not have
	a copy on the floppy accompanying your board, you can download it
	from ftp://ftp.darmstadt.gmd.de/pub/pc/hardware/nic/smc/gez122.exe -
	it is not available from SMC anymore).  This program will allow you
	to reconfigure and recover a card that has lost its configuration
	with a minimum of hassle.

	In order to avoid blowing away the card, one *must* use the
	run-time kernel configuration system when booting the Install
	kernel.  This is done by giving the -c flag to the initial boot
	request.  Following the loading of the kernel, the user is
	presented with a

	UKC>

	prompt.  At this prompt, a variety of commands may be issued, but
	the relevant one to getting the SMC Elite Ultra running is
	'disable'.  The wt0, el0, and ie1 devices all need to be disabled.
	This is done by typing 'disable' followed by the name of the
	device, i.e., 'disable wt0', and pressing return.

	If, for some reason, your Elite Ultra is not configured at the
	'default' location the kernel is expecting it, you may also use
	the 'change' command in the UKC system to modify where the kernel
	will look for it.  Typing 'change we1' will allow you to modify
	those settings.  Note that running the card at an i/o port of
	anything other then 0x300 at this point is not recommended, and is
	beyond the scope of this document-- by doing so you risk other
	device probes wreaking the havoc we are trying to avoid.

	When all three extra devices are disabled and any changes made,
	the 'quit' command will exit the UKC.  The kernel should then
	boot, and find your Elite Ultra on device we1.


Special care for PCI BIOS:

	As all BIOS implementations and subsystems this one has bugs too.
	Sometimes specifications are unclear about interfaces and/or data
	validation.
	These all cause our driver for PCI BIOS to misbehave in more or
	less fatal ways, such as panics on pcibios0 configuration or pci
	device attachments, or unconfigured pci devices due to irq and/or
	I/O address misconfiguration.

	Fast workaround

	Boot by giving the -c flag to the initial boot request.
	Following the loading of the kernel, the user is presented with a

	UKC>

	Then type the following commands:

	UKC> change bios0
	165 bios0 at mainbus0 bus -1 flags 0x0
	change [n] y
	bus [-1] ? <enter>
	flags [0] ? 3
	165 bios0 changed
	165 bios0 at mainbus0 bus -1 flags 0x3
	UKC> quit

	This will disable the pcibios0 attachment.
	Sometimes, especially when hangs occur on particular pci device
	attachments, moving pci cards into a different slot helps.

	Fixing for good

	Try to gather dmesg output from the failing configuration, for
	example by using serial console (see boot(8)) and send it to
	<mickey@openbsd.org> along with descriptions of your hardware setup.
	Alternatively, dig in the code and fix problems.
