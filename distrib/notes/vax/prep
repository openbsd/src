VAX machines don't generally need any specific preparation. You will need
to properly identify the console port on your machine.

Machines without frame buffers (i.e. everything but VAXstations) use serial
port 0 as the console port. However, it is possible to select port 3 instead,
by moving the S3 switch on the back of the machine in the up position. Not
all models have such a switch, though.

Machines with frame buffers (i.e. VAXstations) have a similar S3 switch,
and will either use a serial console connected to port 3 (usually labeled
as the printer port) if the S3 switch is in the up position, or will use
the keyboard and frame buffer console, if the S3 switch is in the down
position. Be warned that early VAXstation 3100 models do not have a hole in
the enclosure to access the switch, and will need to be opened for the
switch to be flipped.

As an exception to the above rule, VXT2000 machines have a W3 jumper on
the motherboard, near the power supply connector. When the jumper is
open, the VXT2000 will use the keyboard and frame buffer console (this
is the factory configuration). Shorting the jumper will switch to
serial console on the DB25 serial connector, and will disable the
frame buffer.

Note that, if the frame buffer in your VAXstation is not supported, OpenBSD
will use serial port 3 as the console, as if the S3 switch had been in the
up position.
