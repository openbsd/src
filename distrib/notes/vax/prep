VAX machines don't generally need any specific preparation. You will need
to properly identify the console port on your machine.

Machines without frame buffers (i.e. everything but VAXstations) use serial
port 0 as the console port. However, it is possible to select port 3 instead,
by moving the S3 switch on the back of the machine in the up position. Not
all models have such a switch, though.

Machines with frame buffers (i.e. VAXstations) have a similar S3 switch,
and will either use a serial console connected to port 3 (usually labeled
as the printer port) if the S3 switch is in the up position, and will use
the keyboard and frame buffer console, if the S3 switch is in the down
position.

Note that, if the frame buffer in your VAXstation is not supported, OpenBSD
will use serial port 3 as the console, as if the S3 switch had been in the
up position.
