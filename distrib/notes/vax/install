For most systems, the easiest way to install OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV is via
diskless booting over an Ethernet network.  You will need both the
"boot.mop" image and the "bsd.rd" kernel to boot.  You will also need a
machine configured as a rarp, MOP, bootparam, and NFS server.

Should your VAX have supported SCSI, however, we provide a floppy image
that can be written onto a disk in another system, and when booted on
the VAX will present you with the standard install prompt. If this is
the case, you can skip ahead to the "ready to install OpenBSD" section.

This document will shortly provide examples on how to set up services
for an OpenBSD netboot server. But if more information is required,
the following resources may be helpful:

The OpenBSD manpages for rarpd(8), mopd(8), nfsd(8), mountd(8),
rpc.bootparamd(8), bootparams(5), and diskless(8). These pages are
available online at: <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi>

Brian Chase <bdc@world.std.com> has written a guide for booting a VAX
off of a network.  It was written for NetBSD/MACHINE, but the procedure is
virtually identical on OpenBSD, and the document covers the use of
several different platforms as servers.
 
The guide is available at:
<http://world.std.com/~bdc/projects/vaxen/VAX-netboot-HOWTO>
 
And finally, there is an OpenBSD/MACHINE mailing list at <vax@openbsd.org>
whose readers would generally be pleased to help.


Booting from Network:

When you turn on your VAX, it will run a set of self-diagnostic ROM routines.
Depending on the model of VAX you have, it may take quite a while.  When 
it is done, you will see a >>> prompt (also called the chevron prompt) on the
console.  Typing "show dev" or "show ethernet" to get the VAX ethernet 
device's MAC address usually works; also try "TEST 50" on MicroVAXen 2000
and 3100.

You will need to create an /etc/ethers file on the bootserver.  This file
will be used by rarpd to answer rarp (ethernet address->IP address) requests.
The format of this file is the ethernet address followed by the machine
name or address.  Here is an example:

08:00:2b:24:72:00		quickvax

Then start rarpd (or configure /etc/rc.conf to always start rarpd).

Copy boot.mop into /tftpboot/mop/1a2b3c4d5e6f.SYS, where "1a2b3c4d5e6f"
represents the six octets of your ethernet address.  For example, the 
filename for the machine described above would be "08002b247200.SYS".
Note that all non alphanumeric characters must be stripped and the
mac portion must be lower case, the extension upper.
Start mopd by typing "mopd -a".

rpc.bootparamd's configuration file is /etc/bootparams.  The format for this
file is described in the diskless(8) and bootparams(5) manpages.  Enable
rpc.bootparamd in /etc/rc.conf by changing the value of "bootparamd_flags". 
Also, make sure "portmap" is "YES"; you will need portmap running.  

nfsd and mountd configuration are described in their respective manual pages.
Make a separate directory for your VAX's /, make sure it is exported via NFS, 
and place "bsd.rd" there.

Typing "B <DEVICE>", where <DEVICE> is your VAX's ethernet device, at the 
chevron prompt should then load the OpenBSD booter.

	After setting up your bootserver, boot from it as described above.

	The OpenBSD bootloader will appear, and a countdown should begin;
	type any key on the console and type "boot bsd.rd".  

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially on a slow
	machine, or from a slow network connection, most likely more than
	a minute.  If some action doesn't eventually happen, or the
	spinning cursor has stopped and nothing further has happened,
	either your diskless setup is incorrect, or you may have a
	hardware or configuration problem.


OpenBSDBootMsgs

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.
	If you are installing from a serial console you should choose
	the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt100).
