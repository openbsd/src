For most systems, the easiest way to install OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV is via
diskless booting over an Ethernet network.  You will need both the
"boot.mop" image and the "bsd.rd" kernel to boot.  You will also need a
machine configured as a rarp, MOP, bootparam, and NFS server.

Should your VAX support SCSI, however, we provide a floppy image that can be
written onto a disk in another system, and when booted on the VAX will
present you with the standard install prompt. If this is the case, you can
skip ahead to the "ready to install OpenBSD" section.

Booting from Network:

If you wish to boot over the network, you need to either have another
OpenBSD system on the network, or something else capable of running the
mopd(8) program.  Source code may be found under usr.sbin/mopd in the
OpenBSD source tree, and is reasonably portable among UN*X-like operating
systems.  For more information on diskless booting under OpenBSD, see
the diskless(8) manual page.

When you turn on your VAX, it will run a set of self-diagnostic ROM
routines. Depending on the model of VAX you have, it may take quite a while.
When it is done, you will see a >>> prompt (also called the chevron prompt)
on the console.  Typing "show dev" or "show ethernet" to get the VAX
ethernet device's MAC address usually works; also try "TEST 50" on
MicroVAXen 2000 and 3100.

You will need to create an /etc/ethers file on the bootserver.  This file
will be used by rarpd to answer rarp (ethernet address->IP address) requests.
The format of this file is the ethernet address followed by the machine
name or address.  Here is an example:

	08:00:2b:24:72:00		quickvax

Then start rarpd (or configure /etc/rc.conf to always start rarpd).

Copy boot.mop into /tftpboot/mop/1a2b3c4d5e6f.SYS, where "1a2b3c4d5e6f"
represents the six octets of your ethernet address.  For example, the 
filename for the machine described above would be "08002b247200.SYS".
Note that all non alphanumeric characters must be stripped and the
mac portion must be lower case, the extension upper.
Start mopd by typing "mopd -a".

Finally, you need to add an entry for your MACHINE in /etc/bootparams.  For
example:

	quickvax	root=myserver:/export/MACHINE

Where myserver is the name of your server machine and `/export/MACHINE' is
the directory that holds the ramdisk kernel image (`bsd.rd').
Enable rpc.bootparamd in /etc/rc.conf by changing the value of
"bootparamd_flags". Also, make sure "portmap" is "YES"; you will need
portmap running.

Now run `rpc.bootparamd' and make sure that the directory is NFS exported to
the client.  See the manual pages on your server system if you need more
information about exporting filesystems.

You are now ready to mopboot your MACHINE. 

Typing "B <DEVICE>", where <DEVICE> is your VAX's ethernet device, at the 
chevron prompt should then load the OpenBSD booter.


Installing using the netboot procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	The OpenBSD bootloader will appear, and a countdown should begin;
	type any key on the console to interrupt and type
		boot bsd.rd

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially on a slow
	machine, or from a slow network connection, most likely more than
	a minute.  If some action doesn't eventually happen, or the
	spinning cursor has stopped and nothing further has happened,
	either your diskless setup is incorrect, or you may have a
	hardware or configuration problem.


OpenBSDBootMsgs

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.
dnl uncomment once display console is available
dnl	If you are installing from a serial console you should choose
dnl	the terminal type from amongst those listed.
dnl	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt100).
	Just hit return to select the default (vt100).
