For most systems, the easiest way to install OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV is via
diskless booting over an Ethernet network.  You will need both the
"boot.mop" image and the "bsd.rd" kernel to boot.  You will also need a
machine configured as a rarp, MOP, bootparam, and NFS server.

However, should your VAX support local storage, we provide a floppy sized
image that can be written onto a disk in another machine, and when booted
on the VAX will present you with the standard install prompt. If you used
this method you can skip ahead to the "ready to install OpenBSD" section.

Booting from Network:

In order to bootstrap via the network, you must provide a second system to
act as a boot server. It is convenient if this is a second OpenBSD machine
as the necessary services are already installed, although source code for
such programs as mopd can be found in OpenBSD's source tree, and should be
reasonably portable to other UN*X-like operating systems. More information
on diskless booting can be found in the OpenBSD diskless(8) manual page.

When you turn on your VAX, it will run an extensive and model specific set
of self-diagnostic ROM routines. When it is done, you should see a >>>
prompt (also called the chevron prompt) on the console.  Typing "show dev"
or "show ethernet" to get the VAX Ethernet device's MAC address usually
works; also try "TEST 50" on MicroVAXen 2000 and 3100.

You will need to create an /etc/ethers file on the bootserver.  This file
will be used by rarpd to answer rarp (Ethernet address->IP address) requests.
The format of this file is the Ethernet address followed by the machine
name or address.  Here is an example:

	08:00:2b:24:72:00		quickvax

Note that the server must be able to resolve "quickvax" to the IP address
you intend to use for your new vax system. This can be accomplished by an
entry in /etc/hosts.

Then start rarpd (or configure /etc/rc.conf to always start rarpd).

Copy boot.mop into /tftpboot/mop/1a2b3c4d5e6f.SYS, where "1a2b3c4d5e6f"
represents the six octets of your Ethernet address.  For example, the
filename for the machine described above would be "08002b247200.SYS".
Note that all non alphanumeric characters must be stripped and the
MAC portion must be lower case, the extension upper.  Start mopd by
typing "mopd -a", if you've not configured it to run by default.

Next you need to export a directory for your new machine to mount over
NFS. This is accomplished by adding an entry to /etc/exports such as:

	/export/MACHINE -maproot=root quickvax

In a typical NFS install, the directory `/export/MACHINE' will contain
the ramdisk kernel image `bsd.rd', although it is possible to populate
it with a full VAX filesystem to act as a true NFS root. Ensure that your
server is configured to export NFS properly, and is running nfsd, mountd,
and the rpc portmapper. See the exports(5) manpage for more information.


Finally, you need to add an entry for your MACHINE in /etc/bootparams.
For example:

	quickvax	root=myserver:/export/MACHINE

Enable rpc.bootparamd either by turning it on in /etc/rc.conf and rebooting,
or by running it manually.

You are now ready to mopboot your MACHINE.

Typing "B <DEVICE>", where <DEVICE> is your VAX's Ethernet device, at the
chevron prompt should then load the OpenBSD booter.


Installing using the netboot procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	The OpenBSD bootloader will appear, and a countdown should begin;
	type any key on the console to interrupt and type

		boot bsd.rd

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially on a slow
	machine, or from a slow network connection, most likely more than
	a minute.  If some action doesn't eventually happen, or the
	spinning cursor has stopped and nothing further has happened,
	either your diskless setup is incorrect, or you may have a
	hardware or configuration problem.
