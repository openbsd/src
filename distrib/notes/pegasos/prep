To be able to boot the OpenBSD/MACHINE installation program, you will
need to acquire some limited knowledge of OpenFirmware, the low-level
process that controls the microprocessor after hardware initialization
and diagnostics are performed but before control is handed to the
operating system.

XXX

Important Open Firmware command examples:

boot cd:OFWBOOT /OSREV/MACHINE/bsd.rd
		(boot from an appropriately prepared
		OpenBSD CD in the CD/DVD drive)

boot net: ofwboot /bsd.rd
		(netboot from a pre-configured bootp/tftp/nfs
		server containing the "ofwboot" and "bsd.rd"
		files at the root directory of the tftp server)

boot /pci/ide/disk:3,ofwboot /bsd /bsd
		(After installation, boot /bsd from the primary
		 device on the first ATA bus, the /bsd is specified
		 TWICE because openfirmware seems to loose the first
		 argument)


printenv	(print current machine variables)
setenv		(set a machine variable)
devalias	(list device aliases; useful for locating other
		devices in the machine such as hard drives etc)

Other Open Firmware command examples:

setenv auto-boot? false
		(force the machine to wait at Open Firmware
		for user input at next reboot; options are true/false)

devalias hd /pci/ide/disk
		Create a devalias so that booting is simplied
setenv boot-device hd:3,ofwboot
		(force the machine to boot into OpenBSD
		automatically at next reboot)

dev /		(change to root level of the device tree)
pwd		(show current location in the device tree)
ls		(show items at current location in the device tree)
words		(show methods of items at current location in the device
		tree)
.properties	(show properties of items at current location in the
		device tree)

Autobooting OpenBSD/MACHINE

It is possible to automatically boot into OpenBSD
by setting up the following:

setenv auto-boot? true
setenv boot-device hd:3,ofwboot

These settings assume that the master of the first IDE bus has OpenBSD
installed on it, in MBR format.  It is not necessary to specify '/bsd'
on the boot line or in the boot-device variable, since it is the
default.

XXX

Sharing a disk with MorphOS:
It is not currently possible to share a disk with MorphOS, Amiga labeled
disks are not currently supported

OpenBSD/MACHINE is capable of booting from a dedicated disk using a
MBR partitioned disk, CD containing a ISO image or a firmware supported
ethernet card.

For dedicated disks, MACHINE port boots off a boot program in
the FFS 'a' filesystem. This is set up by the install program
and no special setup is required.
