Most MACHINE systems are shipped with a Linux system installed on the disk
drive or SSD.  This system will likely use two partitions, one for the
system and applications, and another for the user data. OpenBSD will in turn
need its own MBR partition.

If there is no unpartitioned space left on the disk, it will be necessary to
shrink and recreate the data partition; before installing OpenBSD/MACHINE,
you should make sure any important data on this partition is backed up.

If you intend to only use OpenBSD on your machine, please note that, at this
point, it is necessary to keep an ext2 or ext3 Linux partition, to be able
to boot the system.

Before you install your system, you should familiarize yourself with PMON,
the open source firmware and bootloader of your machine.

Entering PMON:
dnl maybe lemote specific, does gdium use a boot menu too?
    Upon power-up, or after a reset, a splash screen is displayed while PMON
    initializes, and then a text mode boot menu appears.

    At this menu, you can either select one of the systems to boot with the
    arrows keys and press enter, or abort the countdown sequence and get to
    the PMON commandline by hitting `c'.

    PMON command are entered at the ``PMON>'' prompt; you may correct typos
    using the backspace key, and retrieve previous commands from the history
    using Ctrl-P. Unfortunately, there is no cursor shape displayed, which
    can make command line editing quite tedious.

PMON file path concepts:

    The filenames used by PMON always mention explicitly the location of
    the filesystem they refer to, as well as the filesystem type. They
    are constructed as
    	/dev/fs/<filesystem type>@<device name>/<path within the filesystem>

dnl On the Lemote Yeeloong,
    The internal storage (either a disk drive or an SSD) is `wd0'.
dnl On the Gdium Liberty, the G-Key slot is `usbg0'.
    Devices connected to the USB ports are named `usb0', `usb1', etc, in the
    order PMON discovers them. At any time the ``devls'' command will list
    the devices you can boot from. Note that it is not possible to boot from
    the SD card reader.

    Supported filesystems are `ext2', for Linux ext2 and ext3 filesystem
    partition, and `iso9660' for CD-ROM.
dnl Your particular PMON version might
dnl also have some support for FAT-formatted USB keys using `fat' as the
dnl filesystem type.

    As an example, the /boot/vmlinux file on the first partition of the
    hard disk becomes
	/dev/fs/ext2@wd0/boot/vmlinux
