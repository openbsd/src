OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following Data General AViiON systems:

	- AV100/200/300/400, AV3000/4000 and AV4300 series
	- AV4600 and AV530 series

Note that the actual model number found of the chassis might not exactly
match the base number of its family, depending upon the number of processors
and the available options. For example, model AV4605 is a member of the
AV4600 family.

OpenBSD might be able to run on close relatives of these families without
much hassle. If your system is not currently supported under OpenBSD, please
contact <m88k@openbsd.org> and provide some information about your system,
especially the output of `dg_sysreport -p model architecture' from DG/UX.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV supports multiprocessor systems of the AV4600/AV530
family.  To support multiprocessor operation, a separate multiprocessor
kernel (bsd.mp) is included with the installation file sets.

While OpenBSD will boot single-user in 8MB, a minimum of 12MB of RAM is
necessary to install and boot multi-user, and 16MB of RAM are recommended
as a minimum for the system not to be swap-bound, with 32MB or more being
recommended for serious usage of the system.  A minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 250MB disk by installing only the `base' set and using a
small swap partition.

Note that until you have at least 32MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster system.
