There is currently no support for disk controllers in OpenBSD/MACHINE.
Because of this, the only way to use OpenBSD/MACHINE is to run as a
diskless system, with the whole system installed on an NFS filesystem.

Booting from Network:

OpenBSD/MACHINE can boot off any network interface supported by the machine
PROM (SCM), even if the device itself is not supported by OpenBSD.
The OpenSBD network boot loader, netboot, expects a Sun-compatible diskless
setup (bootparams and NFS root). Thus it will be necessary to set up a
complete diskless client configuration on a server. If the boot server is
an OpenBSD system, the diskless(8) manual page will provide detailed
information on the process.

If the server runs another operating system, the setup instructions will
likely be available as part of the documentation that came with it (on
SunOS systems, add_client(8) and the Sun System/Networks administrators
guide constitute a good start; on Solaris systems, share(1M) is a good
starting point as well).

The set up is similar to SunOS diskless setup, but not identical, because
the Sun setup assumes that the bootblocks load a kernel image, which then
uses NFS to access the exported root partition, while the OpenBSD bootblocks
use internal NFS routines to load the kernel image directly from the
exported root partition.

Please understand that no one gets this right the first try, since
there is a lot of setup and all the host daemons must be running and
configured correctly.  If you have problems, extract the diskless(8)
manpage, find someone who's been through it before and use the host
syslog and tcpdump(8) to get visibility of what's happening (or not).

Your MACHINE expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap
program via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RevARP when
instructed to boot "over the net". It will look for a filename composed of
the machine's IP address in hexadecimal. For example, a machine which has
been assigned IP address 130.115.144.11, will make a TFTP request for
`8273900B'.

Normally, this file is a symbolic link to the OpenBSD network boot loader,
which should be located in a place where the TFTP daemon can find it
(remember, many TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).

After the boot program has been loaded into memory and given control by
the PROM, it starts locating the machine's remote root directory through
the BOOTPARAM protocol. First a BOOTPARAM WHOAMI request is broadcast
on the local net. The answer to this request (if it comes in) contains
the client's name. This name is used in the next step, a BOOTPARAM GETFILE
request -- sent to the server that responded to the WHOAMI request --
requesting the name and address of the machine that will serve the client's
root directory, as well as the path of the client's root on that server.

Finally, this information (if it comes in) is used to issue a REMOTE MOUNT
request to the client's root filesystem server, asking for an NFS file
handle corresponding to the root filesystem. If successful, the boot
program starts reading from the remote root filesystem in search of the
kernel which is then read into memory.

Unpack `base{:--:}OSrev.tgz' and `etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz' on the server in the root directory
for your target machine. If you elect to use a separately NFS-mounted
filesystem for `/usr' with your diskless setup, make sure the "./usr" base
files in base{:--:}OSrev.tgz end up in the correct location. One way to do this is
to temporarily use a loopback mount on the server, re-routing <root>/usr to
your server's exported OpenBSD "/usr" directory. Also put the kernel and
the install/upgrade scripts into the root directory.

A few configuration files need to be edited:

	<root>/etc/hosts
		Add the IP addresses of both server and client.

	<root>/etc/myname
		This files contains the client's hostname; use the same
		name as in <root>/etc/hosts.

	<root>/etc/mygate
		This files contains the client's default gateway. It should
		be either an IP address or a name found in the `hosts' file.

	<root>/etc/fstab
		Enter the entries for the remotely mounted filesystems.
		For example:
			server:/export/root/client       /     nfs  rw 0 0
			server:/export/exec/MACHINE.OpenBSD /usr  nfs  rw 0 0

You can now boot the machine from the network by specifying the Ethernet
interface as the boot device, as in

    SCM> b inen()

to boot from the onboard interface, or

    SCM> b hken()

to boot from the Hawk Ethernet card.
