Before installing OpenBSD on your machine, you will want to check your
machine's NVRAM settings.

The defaults settings are usually suitable for OpenBSD; make sure the
environment is configured in BUG mode. You can check and change this with
the ENV command.

You will need to check that the ethernet address is correct as well, with
the LSAD command.

Some models also require specific preparation:
MVME147:
	Make sure the word at memory FFFE0764 is correct. Its value should
	be zero if you don't have any VMEBus memory cards. You can change
	its value with the MM command.

MVME162:
	Be sure to use the SET command to set the date before trying
	to use the ethernet support in the 162-Bug.

If you plan to boot from the network, make sure your ENV settings match
the following setup:

Network Auto Boot Enable [Y/N]   = N? y
Network Auto Boot at power-up only [Y/N] = Y? n
Network Auto Boot Abort Delay    = 5? 2
Network Auto Boot Configuration Parameters Pointer (NVRAM) = 00000000? fffc0080
