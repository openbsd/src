OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- MVME147 - Motorola with 68030 and 68881
	- MVME162 - Motorola with 68040 and IndustryPack slots
	- MVME167 - Motorola with 68040
dnl 172 support is not complete
dnl	- MVME172 - Motorola with 68060 and IndustryPack slots
	- MVME177 - Motorola with 68060

The minimal configuration requires 8M of RAM and ~100M of disk space. To
install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to compile the
system, more RAM is recommended (OpenBSD with 8M of RAM feels like Solaris
with 8M of RAM). Note that until you have 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is
more important than getting a faster CPU board.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:

MVME147:
	serial ports:
		on-board ttya-ttyd
	ethernet:
		on-board AMD 7990 Lance ethernet (le)
	SCSI:
		on-board WD33C93 controller
	VMEbus:
		not supported (some cards have issues)

MVME162, MVME172:
	serial ports:
		on-board tty00-03 - Zilog Z85230 SCC
	ethernet:
		on-board Intel 82596CA ethernet (ie)
	SCSI:
		on-board NCR53c710 controller
	VMEbus:
		drivers for short I/O access (untested)
	Flash:
		1MB flash, either Intel 28F008SA or 28F020
		A driver is available, but doesn't work correctly.
		Jumper GPIO3 selects Flash memory map and must
		be installed for booting with the Flash driver (default)
	SRAM:
		supported
	IndustryPack:
		untested

MVME167, MVME177:
	serial ports:
		on-board tty00 - tty03 - Cirrus Logic CD2401
	ethernet:
		on-board Intel 82596CA ethernet (ie)
	SCSI:
		on-board NCR53c710 controller
	SRAM:
		supported
	VMEbus:
		supported
		

Faithful clones of the above boards should also work.

Additional VMEbus devices supported by the OpenBSD/MACHINE port {:-include-:}:

	MVME328 SCSI controller (vs)

	MVME376 VME bus ethernet (le)
