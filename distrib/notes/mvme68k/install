OpenBSDInstallPrelude

There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk. The easiest way
in terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel that can
be booted from tape.

Alternatively, if the MACHINE is hooked up in a network, it is possible
to setup another machine as a server for diskless setup, which is a
convenient way to install on a machine whose disk does not currently
hold a usable operating system.
This is difficult to get set up correctly the first time, but easy to
use afterwards.  (See ``Installing using a diskless setup'' below).


Booting from the Installation Media:

Prior to attempting an installation, everything of value on the target
system should be backed up.  While installing OpenBSD does not necessarily
wipe out all the partitions on the hard disk, errors during the install
process can have unforeseen consequences and will probably leave the system
unbootable if the installation process is not completed. Availability
of the installation media for the prior installation, such as a Motorola
SystemV/MACHINE tape is always a good insurance, should it be necessary
to "go back" for some reason.

After taking care of all that, the system should be brought down gracefully
using the shutdown(8) and/or halt(8) commands, which will eventually go
bakc to the ``BUG>'' prompt (it may be necessary to send a break if the
system is completely halted).


Booting from SCSI tape:

Bootable tapes can be booted with the following command at the prompt:

	167-bug> bo xx yy

Where `xx' is the SCSI controller number (00 for the built-in SCSI
controller), and `yy' is ten times the tape drive ID, except for the
MVME147, where `xx' should be the tape drive ID, and `yy' should be 00.

For example, booting from a tape drive using SCSI id 4:
	147-bug> bo 04 00
for a MVME147, and
	167-bug> bo 00 40
for any other MACHINE board.


Installing using a diskless setup:

First, a diskless client configuration should be setup on a server. If
the boot server is an OpenBSD system, the diskless(8) manual page will
provide detailed information on the process.

If the server runs another operating system, the setup instructions will
likely be available as part of the documentation that came with it (on
SunOS systems, add_client(8) and the Sun System/Networks administrators
guide constitute a good start; on Solaris systems, share(1M) is a good
starting point as well).

Second, the MACHINE workstation should then be setup using the NIOT command
at the BUG prompt. The ``Load Address'' value should be 0x6F0000, and the
``Execution Address'' value should be 0x6F0000 as well.

Then, it should be possible to boot the machine from the server by entering
the NBO command at the BUG prompt:
	
	167-bug> nbo 00 00 bsd.rd

If the BUG version does not understand the NIOT and NBO commands (most
MVME147 don't), the alternative is to boot from S-Records.


Booting from S-Records:

First, a diskless client configuration should be setup on a server. Refer
to the short description above for details.

Second, using a terminal emulator able to read files from the local machine
and send their contents over the serial link, such as cu(1) and tip(1) - both
being available on OpenBSD - the MACHINE workstation should be put in
S-Records receive mode, with the LO command at the BUG prompr:

	147-bug> LO

If this command prints an error messages and returns to the BUG prompt
immediately, it might be necessary to switch directories, using the SD
command, before retrying.

Then, the contents of the ``sboot'' file should be sent From the terminal
emulator. Depending on the speed of the serial link, this will take some
time, but no more than a couple of minutes.

If a prompt does not come back after a few minutes, it is likely that the
S-Records download is hosed. In this case, the MACHINE board should be reset
before a further attempt to download the S-Records is made.

Once the transfer is finished, entering GO at the BUG prompt will start the
S-Records boot loader. This is a very crude bootloader which will attempt
to fetch a secondary boot program via TFTP requests, like the NBO command.

This will cause the kernel provided by the diskless setup to be booted.
After the initial probe messages you'll asked to start the install
or upgrade procedure.



Installing using the tape or netboot procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially from a slow
	network connection, most likely more than a minute.  If some action
	doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor has stopped and
	nothing further has happened, either your boot media is bad, your
	diskless setup isn't correct, or you may have a hardware or
	configuration problem.

OpenBSDBootMsgs

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  You should choose
	the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt100).

Net Boot or Diskless Setup Information:

The set up is similar to SunOS diskless setup, but not identical, because
the Sun setup assumes that the bootblocks load a kernel image, which then
uses NFS to access the exported root partition, while the OpenBSD bootblocks
use internal NFS routines to load the kernel image directly from the
exported root partition.

Please understand that no one gets this right the first try, since
there is a lot of setup and all the host daemons must be running and
configured correctly.  If you have problems, extract the diskless(8)
manpage, find someone who's been through it before and use the host
syslog and tcpdump(8) to get visibility of what's happening (or not).

Your MACHINE expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap
program via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RevARP when
instructed to boot "over the net". It will look for a filename composed of
the machine's IP address, followed by the machine's architecture, separated
by a period. For example, a MACHINE board which has been assigned IP
address 130.115.144.11, will make an TFTP request for `8273900B.MACHINE'.
Normally, this file is a symbolic link to an appropriate second-stage
boot program, which should be located in a place where the TFTP daemon
can find it (remember, many TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).

You can find the boot program in `/usr/mdec/netboot' in the OpenBSD/MACHINE
distribution.

After the boot program has been loaded into memory and given control by
the BUG, it starts locating the machine's remote root directory through
the BOOTPARAM protocol. First a BOOTPARAM WHOAMI request is broadcast
on the local net. The answer to this request (if it comes in) contains
the client's name. This name is used in next step, a BOOTPARAM GETFILE
request -- sent to the server that responded to the WHOAMI request --
requesting the name and address of the machine that will serve the client's
root directory, as well as the path of the client's root on that server.

Finally, this information (if it comes in) is used to issue a REMOTE MOUNT
request to the client's root filesystem server, asking for an NFS file
handle corresponding to the root filesystem. If successful, the boot
program starts reading from the remote root filesystem in search of the
kernel which is then read into memory.

Unpack `base{:--:}OSrev.tgz' and `etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz' on the server in the root directory
for your target machine. If you elect to use a separately NFS-mounted
filesystem for `/usr' with your diskless setup, make sure the "./usr" base
files in base{:--:}OSrev.tgz end up in the correct location. One way to do this is
to temporarily use a loopback mount on the server, re-routing <root>/usr to
your server's exported OpenBSD "/usr" directory. Also put the kernel and
the install/upgrade scripts into the root directory.

A few configuration files need to be edited:

	<root>/etc/hosts
		Add the IP addresses of both server and client.

	<root>/etc/myname
		This files contains the client's hostname; use the same
		name as in <root>/etc/hosts.

	<root>/etc/fstab
		Enter the entries for the remotely mounted filesystems.
		For example:
			server:/export/root/client       /     nfs  rw 0 0
			server:/export/exec/MACHINE.OpenBSD /usr  nfs  rw 0 0

Now you must populate the `/dev' directory for your client. If the server
runs SunOS 4.x, you can simply change your working directory to `<root>/dev'
and run the MAKEDEV script: `sh MAKEDEV all' (this might require the edition
of MAKEDEV to change the PATH for it to work properly).

On SunOS 5.x systems, MAKEDEV can also be used, but there'll be error
messages about unknown user and groups. These errors are inconsequential
for the purpose of installing OpenBSD. However, you may want to correct them
if you plan to the diskless setup regularly. In that case, you may re-run
MAKEDEV on your OpenBSD machine once it has booted.
