OpenBSD/sparc OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- sun4  -- 4/100, 4/200, and 4/300.   (note that support
		   for the 4/400 processor is incomplete)
	- sun4c -- SS1, SS1+, SS2, IPC, ELC, IPX, and SLC
	- sun4m -- Sparc Classic, LX, 4, 5, 10, and 20. *** See Notes Below
	- faithful clones of the above Sun systems (e.g. Integrix)

OpenBSD/sparc OSREV does NOT run on these machines (yet):
	- Sun 4/400 --  Lacking support for the I/O cache, and related
			ethernet problems.
	- Sun 4/6xx -- Sparcserver 600MP, Different registers (auxio
			vs. leds), VMEbus on sun4m arch, iommu issues.
	- sun4d -- SPARCcenter 2000, SPARCserver 1000,  XDBus and
			multiprocessor support issues.
	- sun4u (Ultrasparcs) --  currently no support for 64-bit Sparc
			architecture extensions.  sun4u will have its own port.
	- clones that are significantly different from the Sun systems 
			(e.g. Solbourne)

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (OpenBSD with 4M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)  Installation from "ramdisk" kernels requires 8M of RAM.

*** Note: sun4m and general sparc caveats

As of of the OpenBSD OSREV release there are still some outstanding problems
with OpenBSD on the various Sparc architectures.  The sun4m architecture,
particularly the Viking/SuperSPARC implementations, is probably the least
stable and is also lacking useful floppy/audio support.  

The supplied GENERIC kernel is the best attempt at a configuration that
works on the widest range of machinery (sun4, sun4c, and sun4m).  
If you have problems with the OpenBSD OSREV kernel in this distribution, 
please visit the OpenBSD web page (http://www.openbsd.org) and the mailing 
lists to review the current status and check for updates and distribution
errata.

If you have Sparc hardware you can donate or make available at nominal
cost, please mention this on the lists, many things aren't being tested
or developed simply because developers usually have only a Sparcstation
at hand, not an array of systems.  Donation or mid/long term loan of
UltraSparc (sun4u) or HyperSparc (sun4m) systems would help ensure the
long-term viability of OpenBSD on Sparc based systems.

Your support in terms of documenting previously unknown problems with
OpenBSD/sparc, helping debug known problems, implementing missing pieces,
and testing OpenBSD on various architectures is actively encouraged.
The OpenBSD mailing lists, web-pages and sendbug utility are your best
tools for helping make OpenBSD/sparc a better release.
