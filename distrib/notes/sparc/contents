Please note that there are multiple bootable images and kernels, intended
to allow installing OpenBSD/sparc in a variety of situations without
requiring a pre-existing working operating system.

The "kc{:--:}OSrev.fs" image is a bootable floppy image, which is used in conjunction
with "inst{:--:}OSrev.fs" or "upgr{:--:}OSrev.fs", to allow installing or upgrading systems
with supported floppy disk drives (not Sun4m at this time).

The "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs" is a small bootable root filesystem that can be used
for installation or upgrade where there is some means to copy the miniroot
image into a swap or unused partition on the system, and also for diskless
or net booting.  This can be convenient if you have a existing installation
of OpenBSD, NetBSD, SunOS, or Solaris and wish to test or upgrade the
existing system to OpenBSD.

The "floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs" is a new bootable floppy image, with contents similar
to a miniroot stored in a compressed kernel with pre-loaded ramdisk.  As
of release time, this version has not received adequate testing and may
not work reliably on many systems, but is provided as a convenience for
for people installing on Sun4m systems where the other floppy installation
method doesn't work due to lack of Sun4m floppy driver support.

These bootable images are also useful as "failsafe" boots for system
maintenance and disaster recovery.

The kernel and boot images are provided for net booting installations.
While the OpenBSD bootblocks will work with the provided miniroot images,
Sun bootblocks require a separate kernel image and root filesystem.


Bootable installation/upgrade floppies:
  
  kc{:--:}OSrev.fs
 	This disk is bootable, and only contains the boot loader and
        kernel.

  inst{:--:}OSrev.fs
	This disk contains an installation file system, and has enough 
	utilities on board to prepare your hard disk drive for OpenBSD.

  upgr{:--:}OSrev.fs
	This disk contains a file system, and has holds the utilities 
	needed in order to upgrade an existing OpenBSD (or NetBSD) system
	to a minimal working OpenBSD OSREV system.

  floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs
	This disk contains a compressed ramdisk filesystem, and holds
        all utilities needed to install or upgrade to OpenBSD OSREV
  
  miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs
	This is a miniroot filesystem image which can be copied to the
	swap partition of an existing OpenBSD, NetBSD, Linux, SunOS, 
	or Solaris installation to allow upgrading to OpenBSD OSREV
