		bsd.scsi3	A kernel with SCSI target 3 re-mapped as 0
				and 0 mapped as 3.

		installboot	The OpenBSD/MACHINE boot loader installation
				program
		bootxx		The OpenBSD/MACHINE boot block
		boot		The OpenBSD/MACHINE secondary boot loader
		boot.net	The OpenBSD/MACHINE network boot loader


Please note that there are multiple bootable images and kernels, intended
to allow installing OpenBSD/MACHINE in a variety of situations without
requiring a pre-existing working operating system.

The kernel and boot images are provided for net booting installations.
While the OpenBSD bootblocks will work with the provided miniroot images,
Sun bootblocks require a separate kernel image and root filesystem.

Bootable installation floppy image:

	The single floppy image can be copied to a floppy using rawrite.exe,
	ntrw.exe or `dd', as described later in this document.
	The floppy image is a bootable install floppy which can be used
	to install OpenBSD to the current version.
	It is also useful for maintenance and disaster recovery.
