Before you start you might need to consider your disk configuration
to sort out a quirk in SCSI-ID to SD-UNIT mapping that exists on
Sun Sparcstations.

Upon leaving the factory, SunOS and the OpenBOOT ROM map according to
this table:

    SCSI-ID ->	SunOS SD-UNIT
    0		sd3
    1		sd1
    2		sd2
    3		sd0
    4		sd4
    5		sd5
    6		sd6

Unlike SunOS and the OpenBOOT ROM, a generic NetBSD kernel numbers
scsi drives sequentially as it finds them.  The drive with the
lowest scsi-id will be called sd0, the next one sd1, etc.

To ease the installation process, the default NetBSD kernel in the
distribution is setup to match the Sun mapping above by hard-wiring
scsi-id#3 to sd0 and scsi-id#0 to sd3. The remaining drives will be
dynamically mapped to other sd* numbers.

A truely generic NetBSD kernel is also provided as `/netbsd.GENERIC',
which will do the standard NetBSD probe ordering. If your configuration
differs from the default Sun setup, you can try to use this kernel to
complete the installation.

NOTE: this is also a concern when you start building your own customised
kernels.


Your OpenBOOT ROM may need some setup.  make sure you boot from `new
command mode'.  If your machine comes up and gives you a `>' prompt
instead of `ok', type:

    >n
    ok setenv sunmon-compat? false
    ok

This is needed because netbsd cannot handle the old-mode yet, and will
firework on you.

Also, you cannot use the security modes of the sparc OpenBOOT ROM.

    ok setenv security-mode none
