Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM
	FFS partitions
	HFS partitions (bootloader/kernel only, using another media for D/L)
	Tape
	FTP
	HTTP

OpenBSD now can be booted from a CD-ROM by holding down the 'c' key
during reboot. If ofwboot and bsd.rd are copied to a HFS partition, it
is possible to boot from those files.  Then install the rest of the files
from any of the above sources.

Note: Once a OpenBSD partition exists, it is not possible to load the
kernel (bsd.rd) from a HFS partition on that disk.
