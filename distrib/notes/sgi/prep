Before you install your system, you should identify your system family and
familiarize yourself with the ARCBios setup and how to run programs from
the Command monitor prompt.

Identifying your system:

    Due to significant design differences in SGI systems, OpenBSD
    needs to use different kernels, depending on the system family.

    There are currently four system families supported by OpenBSD:

    IP27 family:
	Origin 200, Onyx 2
	Origin 2000

    IP30 family:
	Octane, Octane 2

    IP32 family:
	O2, O2+

    IP35 family:
dnl	Origin 300, Origin 3000, Onyx 300
	Origin 350, Onyx 350, Onyx 4
	Fuel
	Tezro

    You should use the kernels (bsd and bsd.rd) with the IP suffix
    matching your family number, except for IP35 systems which use
    IP27 kernels.

Accessing the Maintenance Console:

    When the system starts up, press the ESC key or use the mouse and
    click the ``stop for maintenance'' button. Once in the System
    Maintenance Menu, select '5' (or click the appropriate icon if you
    are using the graphics console) to go into the Command Monitor.

    If the internal disk with the lowest SCSI ID does not contain a
    valid Volume Header, but is bootable, the Maintenance Console will
    be entered by default.

    The first time the Maintenance Console is entered, it may be
    necessary to force a reset of the environment to its default
    settings by entering the ``resetenv'' command at the chevron
    prompt. If some variables have been set explicitly, this may
    disturb the normal OpenBSD boot process.

Switching from serial to graphics console and vice versa:

    To change to serial console, go into the ARCBios Maintenance Console
    and change the ``console'' environment variable, and power-cycle
    the machine.

    >> setenv console d

    will select 8N1, no flow control, serial console on the first serial
    port (labeled ``(1)''), while

    >> setenv console g

    will select the graphics console.

    The speed of the serial console is controlled by the ``dbaud'' environment
    variable, and defaults to 9600 bps if this variable is not set.

    Not all graphics options are currently supported by OpenBSD. If your
    system is configured for graphics console but the kernel does not
    support your frame buffer, it will fallback to serial console on the
    first serial port.

    As of OpenBSD OSREV, supported graphics console devices are:
    - the onboard frame buffer on IP32 systems (gbe)
    - VPro family frame buffers on IP27, IP30 and IP35 systems (odyssey)

    And the following graphics devices are not supported yet:
    - ImpactSR (Mardigras) frame buffer on IP30 (I-Series and E-Series)
    - Infinite Reality (Kona) frame buffer on IP27/IP35 Onyx systems
    - Voyager (Ultimate Vision) frame buffer on IP35 Onyx 4 systems

Switching from L1 console to serial console and vice versa:

    IP35 systems without a graphics console can have the PROM console output
    either on the L1 console serial port, or the regular serial port. 

    The `console' command at the PROM prompt, can select between them:

    >> console sc

    will switch to the L1 serial port, while

    >> console ioc3

    or

    >> console ioc4

    will select the regular serial port, depending on the I/O board type.

    On Fuel systems, there is no external L1 serial port, so `console sc'
    should never be used on these machines.

    Origin 300 and 3000 families can switch between `sc' and `ioc3', while
    Origin 350 and 3500 families can switch between `sc' and `ioc4'.

    The OpenBSD kernel only supports serial console on the regular serial
    ports; if your PROM console is on the L1 port, the kernel console will
    nevertheless pick the first IOC3 or IOC4 serial port.

Setting the environment:

    When setting up the system to boot from disk, the ``OSLoader''
    environment variable will need to be changed.

    Its default value is ``sash'', which is IRIX's standalone
    shell and loader. Set it to ``boot'', the OpenBSD boot loader.

    Also, by default it tries to boot a kernel named ``/unix''. To
    make it boot OpenBSD, set ``OSLoadFilename'' to ``/bsd''.

    To enable automatic booting of OpenBSD once the machine has passed its
    diagnostic tests, change the value of ``AutoLoad'' to ``Yes''.
