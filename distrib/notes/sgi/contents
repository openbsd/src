dnl five flavours of OpenBSDbsd
	bsd.IP22	A stock GENERIC-IP22 MACHINE kernel for IP22 class
			machines, which will be installed on such systems
			during the install.

	bsd.IP27	A stock GENERIC-IP27 MACHINE kernel for IP27 and IP35
			class machines, which will be installed on such
			systems during the install.

	bsd.IP28	A stock GENERIC-IP28 MACHINE kernel for IP28 class
			machines, which will be installed on such systems
			during the install.

	bsd.IP30	A stock GENERIC-IP30 MACHINE kernel for IP30 class
			machines, which will be installed on such systems
			during the install.

	bsd.IP32	A stock GENERIC-IP32 MACHINE kernel for IP32 class
			machines, which will be installed on such systems
			during the install.

dnl one flavour of OpenBSDbsdmp so far...
	bsd.IP30.mp	A stock GENERIC-IP30.MP MACHINE kernel for IP30 class
			machines, with support for multiprocessor systems,
			which can be used instead of the GENERIC-IP30 kernel
			after the install.

dnl five flavours of OpenBSDrd
	bsd.rd.IP22	A RAMDISK-IP22 kernel; the embedded filesystem
			contains the installation tools.
			Used for installation and upgrades.

	bsd.rd.IP27	A RAMDISK-IP27 kernel; the embedded filesystem
			contains the installation tools.
			Used for installation and upgrades.

	bsd.rd.IP28	A RAMDISK-IP28 kernel; the embedded filesystem
			contains the installation tools.
			Used for installation and upgrades.

	bsd.rd.IP30	A RAMDISK-IP30 kernel; the embedded filesystem
			contains the installation tools.
			Used for installation and upgrades.

	bsd.rd.IP32	A RAMDISK-IP32 kernel; the embedded filesystem
			contains the installation tools.
			Used for installation and upgrades.

dnl can't use OpenBSDcd because of the multiple bsd.rd
	cd{:--:}OSrev.iso	A simple bootable filesystem image consisting of
			all the bsd.rd.* installation kernels above, suitable
			to be used as a bootable CD-ROM image, but will require
			the base and X sets be found via another media or
			network.

	boot32		A 32-bit ELF boot block for IP32 systems; will be
			installed into the ``volume header'' of the boot
			disk.

	boot64		A 64-bit relocatable ELF boot block for IP27, IP28,
			IP30 and IP35 systems; will be installed into the
			``volume header'' of the boot disk.

	bootecoff	A 32-bit ECOFF boot block for IP22 systems, also
			used to boot ELF kernels over the network on
			ELF-unaware PROM; will be installed into the
			``volume header'' of the boot disk.
