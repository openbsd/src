dnl three flavours of OpenBSDbsd
	bsd.IP27	A stock GENERIC-IP27 MACHINE kernel for IP27 and IP35
			class machines, which will be installed on such
			systems during the install.

	bsd.IP30	A stock GENERIC-IP30 MACHINE kernel for IP30 class
			machines, which will be installed on such systems
			during the install.

	bsd.IP32	A stock GENERIC-IP32 MACHINE kernel for IP32 class
			machines, which will be installed on such systems
			during the install.

dnl one flavour of OpenBSDbsdmp so far...
	bsd.IP30.mp	A stock GENERIC-IP30.MP MACHINE kernel for IP30 class
			machines, with support for multiprocessor systems,
			which can be used instead of the GENERIC-IP30 kernel
			after the install.

dnl three flavours of OpenBSDrd
	bsd.rd.IP27	A compressed RAMDISK-IP27 kernel; the embedded
			filesystem contains the installation tools.
			Used for simple installation from a pre-existing
			system.

	bsd.rd.IP30	A compressed RAMDISK-IP30 kernel; the embedded
			filesystem contains the installation tools.
			Used for simple installation from a pre-existing
			system.

	bsd.rd.IP32	A compressed RAMDISK-IP32 kernel; the embedded
			filesystem contains the installation tools.
			Used for simple installation from a pre-existing
			system.

dnl can't use OpenBSDcd because of the multiple bsd.rd
	cd{:--:}OSrev.iso	A miniroot filesystem image suitable to be used
			as a bootable CD-ROM image, but will require the base
			and X sets be found via another media or network;
			otherwise similar to the bsd.rd* images above.
