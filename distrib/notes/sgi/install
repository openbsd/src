There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk. The easiest way
in terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel that
can be booted via BOOTP. Booting from CD is not yet supported.


Installing using the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel.

The ramdisk kernel is a self-contained OpenBSD filesystem including all
utilities necessary to install OpenBSD on a local disk, embedded in a
GENERIC kernel image. It is distributed as a plain ELF executable file
designed to be loaded into the system by the ARCS firmware.

Booting the ramdisk kernel can be done from the ARCS graphic console
although it might be more convenient to use the serial console since
the kernel currently only supports the serial console. Some systems
come with the serial console but enabled by default but sometimes this
must be changed.

To change to serial console, go into the ARCS Maintenance console. When
the system starts up, press the ESC key or use the the mouse and click
the STOP FOR MAINTENANCE button. Once in the System maintenance meny,
select '5' to go into the Command monitor. If the installed disk does
not contain a valid Volume Header and is bootable the Maintenance
console will be entered by default.

It may be necessary to do a reset of the environment to its default setting
by entering the command:

> resetenv


To switch the console to serial mode, change the console environment
variable:

> setenv console d

and reboot the system. A serial console at 9600B8N1 and no flow control
should be attached to the serial port marked (1).

If changing back to the graphics console is required do:

> setenv console g

After reboot, when the message:
        To perform system maintenance instead, press <Esc>
is displayed, press the ESCAPE key to get into maintenance mode. Again,
select '5' to get to the Command monitor.

When setting up the system to boot from disk, one environment variable
needs to be changed. Set 'OSLoader' to 'boot'. By default it is set to
'sash' which is the IRIX stand alone shell and loader. It may be convenient
to do this setup now so the system will diskboot once the 'reboot' command
is entered after the installation is complete.

To be able to boot, a bootp/dhcpd server needs to be set up. See the dhcpd(8)
man page for information on how to set up the dhcp server to respond to
a bootp client. The dhcp server needs to know the ethernet address of the
system. This address can be found by using the 'printenv' command and looking
for the 'eaddr' variable.

Loading the ramdisk kernel into your system is done with the appropriate
ARCS boot command on Your system. Usually this is done by typing in the
following string at the ARCS prompt:

	bootp()/bsd.rd

to boot from Your TFTP server.

This will cause the ramdisk kernel to be booted. After the initial probe
messages you'll will see the question:

TBD.

The script will do most of the work of transferring the system from the
tar files onto your disk. You will frequently be asked for confirmation
before the script proceeds with each phase of the installation process.
Occasionally, you'll have to provide a piece of information such as the
name of the disk you want to install on or IP addresses and domain names
you want to assign.

The installation script goes through the following phases:

	- determination of the disk to install OpenBSD on
	- checking of the OpenBSD partition information on the disk
	- creating and mounting the OpenBSD filesystems
	- setup of IP configuration
	- extraction of the distribution tar files
	- installation of kernel and the bootable kernel

The installation program will guide you through the installation.
