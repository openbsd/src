OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the systems built around the following
MVME boards:

	- MVME181 (Barebone system with 88100 processor)
	- MVME187/M8120 (Single board computer with 88100 processor)
	- MVME188 (HYPERmodule-based systems with up to 4 88100 processors)
	- MVME197LE (Single board computer with 88110 processor)
	- MVME197SP/DP (Single board computer with up to two 88110 processors)

Besides various Motorola complete systems (M8120, Series 900, etc),
OpenBSD/MACHINE also runs on the MVME187-based Triton Dolphin
System 100.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV supports MVME188 and MVME197DP SMP (Symmetrical
MultiProcessor) systems.  To support SMP operation, a separate SMP kernel
(bsd.mp) is included with the installation file sets.

While OpenBSD will boot single-user in 8MB, a minimum of 12MB of RAM is
necessary to install and boot multi-user, and 16MB of RAM are recommended
as a minimum for the system not to be swap-bound, with 32MB or more being
recommended for serious usage of the system.  A minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 250MB disk by installing only the `base' and `etc' sets
and using a small swap partition.

Note that until you have at least 32MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU board.
