OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- MVME187 - Motorola with 88100

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~80M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to 
compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (OpenBSD with 4M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)
