OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- MVME187 - Single board computer with 88100 processor
	- Motorola 8120 - non expandable MVME187

The minimal configuration requires 8M of RAM and ~250M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to
compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:

MVME187, Motorola 8120:
	serial ports:
		on-board tty00 - tty03 - Cirrus Logic CD2401
	ethernet:
		on-board Intel 82596CA ethernet ("ie0")
	SCSI:
		on-board SCSI controller NCR53c710
	SRAM:
		supported
	VMEbus:
		supported (on MVME187 only, the 8120 does not have VME)

Additional VMEbus devices supported by the OpenBSD/MACHINE port {:-include-:}:

	MVME328 SCSI controller (vs)

	MVME332 Serial controller (vx)

	MVME376 Ethernet controller (ve)
