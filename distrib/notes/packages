As complete as your OpenBSD system is, you may want to add any of several
excellent third party software applications.  There are several ways to do
this.  You can:

1) Obtain the source code and build the application based
   upon whatever installation procedures are provided with the
   application.

2) Use the OpenBSD ``ports'' collection to automatically get any
   needed source file, apply any required patches, create the
   application, and install it for you.

3) Use the OpenBSD ``package'' collection to grab a pre-compiled
   and tested version of the application for your hardware.

If you purchased the OpenBSD CD-ROM you already have several popular
``packages'', the ``ports'' collection, and some of the ``ports''
source file releases.

 NOTE:	Some important packages which are not permitted on the CD (due to
	patents) are available on our FTP servers.  In 	particular, we
	provide  the USA and international versions of both SSH and PGP.
	The filenames are:
		ssh-usa-1.2.26.tgz	ssh-intl-1.2.26.tgz
		pgp-usa-2.6.3.tgz	pgp-intl-2.6.3.tgz

	You are STRONGLY urged to install one of the above ssh packages and
	use ssh instead of telnet, rlogin, or rsh.  See below for
	instructions on installing packages using ftp.

Instructions for installing applications from the various sources using
the different installation methods follow.  If emacs is to be installed
it should be installed first as it creates the ``info'' directory file
that may be modified by other applications.

Installing applications from the CD-ROM package collection:

	The OpenBSD CD-ROM ships with several applications pre-built
	for various hardware architectures.  The number of applications
	vary according to available disk space.  Check the directory
	OSREV/packages/MACHINE to see which packages are available for
	your hardware architecture.  That directory will be on the same
	CD-ROM containing the OS installation files for your architecture.

	To install one or more of these packages you must
	1) become the superuser (root)
	2) mount the appropriage CD-ROM
	3) use the ``pkg_add'' command to install the software

	Example (in which we use su(1) to get superuser privileges, thus
	you have to be in group "wheel", see the manual page for su(1)).

    $ su
    Password: <enter your root password>
    # mkdir -p /cdrom
    # mount /dev/cd0a /cdrom
    {:-#-:} pkg_add /cdrom/OSREV/packages/MACHINE/<package-name>
    # <add more packages if desired>
    # umount /cdrom
	
	Package names are usually the application name and version
	with .tgz appended, e.g. emacs-20.3.tgz

Installing applications from the ftp.openbsd.org package collection:

	All available packages for your architecture have been placed on
	ftp.openbsd.org in the directory pub/OpenBSD/OSREV/packages/MACHINE/
	You may want to peruse this to see what packages are available.  The
	packages are also on the OpenBSD FTP mirror sites.  See

		http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html

	for a list of current ftp mirror sites.

	Installation of a package is very easy.
	1) become the superuser (root)
	2) use the ``pkg_add'' command to install the software

	``pkg_add'' is smart enough to know how to download the software
	from the OpenBSD ftp server.  Example:

    $ su
    Password: <enter your root password>
    {:-#-:} pkg_add ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/{:--:}OSREV/packages/MACHINE/emacs-20.3.tgz

	Note: there are both USA and INTERNATIONAL versions of ssh and
	pgp on the ftp server.  Be sure to grab the correct version.
	The USA versions, ssh-usa-1.2.26.tgz and pgp-usa-2.6.3.tgz, use
	RSAREF, a legal requirement for use within the United States due
	to patent issues.

Installing applications from the CD-ROM ports collection:

	The CD-ROM ``ports'' collection is a set of Makefiles, patches,
	and other files used to control the building and installation
	of an application from source files.  The source files come
	from archives which are also, for the most part, on the
	OpenBSD CD-ROM.

	Creating an application from sources can require a lot of
	disk space, sometimes 50 megabytes or more.  The first step is
	to determine which of your disks has enough room.  Once you've
	made this determination read the file README.ports on CD-ROM 2
	to see how to copy or mount the ports directory.

	To build an application you must:

	1) become the superuser (root)
	2) mount CD-ROM number 2 on the directory /cdrom.  This is
	   necessary to find the application source files.
	3) cd to the ports directory containing the port you wish
	   to build.  To build samba, for example, where you'd
	   previously copied the ports files into the /usr/ports
	   directory: cd /usr/ports/net/samba
	4) make FETCH_SYMLINK_DISTFILES=YES
	5) make FETCH_SYMLINK_DISTFILES=YES install
	6) make FETCH_SYMLINK_DISTFILES=YES clean

	The FETCH_SYMLINK_DISTFILES=YES parameter tells make not to copy
	the application's distribution sources from the cdrom to your hard
	disk, but instead create a symbolic link pointing to the CD-ROM.
	This is done to conserve disk space.

Installing applications from the OpenBSD ports collection:

	See http://www.openbsd.org/ports.html for current instructions
	on obtaining and installing OpenBSD ports.

Installing other applications:

	If an OpenBSD package or port does not exist for an application
	you're pretty much on your own.  The first thing to do is ask
	ports@openbsd.org if anyone is working on a port -- there may
	be one in progress.  If no luck there you may try the FreeBSD
	ports or NetBSD package collection.  If you are on an i386 based
	machine it is quite possible that the FreeBSD port, if one exists,
	will work for you.

	If you can't find an existing port try to make your own and
	feed it back to OpenBSD.  That's how our ports collection grows.
	Some details can be found at http://www.openbsd.org/porting.html
	with more help coming from the mailing list, ports@openbsd.org.
