There is no automated upgrade program in this release.
(This is the first official release for the Sun3 anyway.)
However, it is possible to upgrade your system manually.

Manual upgrade procedure:

	* Place _at least_ the `base' binary set in a filesystem
	  accessible to the target machine.  A local filesystem
	  is preferred, since there may be incompatibilities
	  between the OpenBSD OSREV kernel and older route(8)
	  binaries.

	* Back up your pre-existing kernel and copy the OSREV
	  kernel into your root partition.

	* Reboot with the OSREV kernel into single-user mode.

	* Check all filesystems:

		/sbin/fsck -p

	* Mount all local filesystems:

		/sbin/mount -a -t nonfs

	* If you keep /usr or /usr/share on an NFS server, you
	  will want to mount those filesystems as well.  To do
	  this, you will need to enable the network:

		sh /etc/netstart

	  NOTE: the route(8) commands may fail due to potential
	  incompatibilities between route(8) and the OpenBSD OSREV
	  kernel.  Once you have enabled the network, mount the
	  NFS filesystems.  If you use amd(8), you may or may not
	  have to mount these filesystems manually.  Your mileage
	  may vary.

	* Make sure you are in the root filesystem and extract
	  the `base' binary set:

		cd /
		tar -xzvpf /path/to/base{:--:}OSrev.tar.gz

	* Install a new boot block:

		cd /usr/mdec
		cp -p ./ufsboot /mnt/ufsboot
		sync ; sleep 1 ; sync
		./installboot /mnt/ufsboot bootxx /dev/rsd0a
		# Substitute your root partition here -^

	* Sync the filesystems:

		sync

	* At this point you may extract any other binary sets
	  you may have placed on local filesystems, or you may
	  wish to extract additional sets at a later time.
	  To extract these sets, use the following commands:

		cd /
		tar -xzvpf <path to set>

NOTE: you SHOULD NOT extract the `etc' set if upgrading.  Instead,
you should extract that set into another area and carefully merge
the changes by hand.
