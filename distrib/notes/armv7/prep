Please be aware that OpenBSD support for this platform is far from
complete.

At the moment the only way to boot the OpenBSD install is to copy the
miniroot for your board "miniroot-{am335x,beagle,imx,panda,sunxi}-{:--:}OSrev.fs"
image to an sdcard.

As a result you need another machine to plug the sdcard in. Any
machine type will do, as long as it supports sdcard storage devices.
Under OpenBSD, it will appear as a ``sd'' device, for example sd1.

Use the dd(1) utility to copy the miniroot to the hard drive.
The command would likely be, under OpenBSD:
	dd if=miniroot-beagle-{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rsd1c

When you have connected the BeagleBoard to you computer, a command such
as "cu -l cuaU0 -s 115200" (assuming cuaU0 is your serial port device)
should connect you to the board's console.

Note: By default the BeagleBone Black will boot from the internal emmc.
In order to make it boot from the micro sdcard, you will need to hold down
the small button located by the sdcard slot while powering on the board.
Once you have done this the board will boot from the sdcard as the default.
