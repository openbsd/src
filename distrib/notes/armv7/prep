Please be aware that OpenBSD support for this platform is far from
complete.

OpenBSD can be installed onto a disk by copying the miniroot for your
board "miniroot-{am335x,beagle,imx,panda,cubie}-{:--:}OSrev.fs"
image to an SD card or by booting the ramdisk kernel over the network
using a TFTP server.

Booting from an SD card:

  To use the miniroot image you will need another machine to plug the
  SD card in to. Any machine type will do, as long as it supports SD card
  storage devices.  Under OpenBSD, it will appear as a ``sd'' device, for
  example sd1.
  
  Use the dd(1) utility to copy the miniroot to the hard drive.
  The command would likely be, under OpenBSD:
  	dd if=miniroot-beagle-{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rsd1c
  
  When you have connected the BeagleBoard to you computer, a command such
  as "cu -l cuaU0 -s 115200" (assuming cuaU0 is your serial port device)
  should connect you to the board's console.
  
  Note: By default the BeagleBone Black will boot from the internal emmc.
  In order to make it boot from the micro SD card, you will need to hold down
  the small button located by the SD card slot while powering on the board.
  Once you have done this the board will boot from the SD card as the default.

Booting over the network:

  To interrupt the U-Boot boot process press a key after the banner is
  displayed on the serial console.

  Then the U-Boot image of the ramdisk kernel can be loaded via TFTP.

  Configure the local IP address via DHCP:

      U-Boot# setenv autoload no
      U-Boot# dhcp

  Or with a static address:

      U-Boot# setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.2

  Set the IP address of the TFTP server:

      U-Boot# setenv serverip 192.168.1.1

  To load an OMAP ramdisk image via TFTP:

      U-Boot# tftpboot bsd.rd.OMAP.umg
      U-Boot# bootm
