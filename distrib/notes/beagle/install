Now you are ready to power up the board. It will print some hardware
information and if your SD card has been properly setup the autoboot
script will be loaded:

	Hit any key to stop autoboot:  0 
	mmc1 is available
	The user button is currently NOT pressed.
	reading boot.scr

	123 bytes read
	Running bootscript from mmc ...
	## Executing script at 80200000
	reading bsd.umg

	2634332 bytes read

	## Booting kernel from Legacy Image at 82800000 ...
	   Image Name:   boot
	   Image Type:   ARM Linux Kernel Image (uncompressed)
	   Data Size:    2634268 Bytes =  2.5 MB
	   Load Address: 80300000
	   Entry Point:  80300000
	   Verifying Checksum ... OK
	   Loading Kernel Image ... OK
	OK

	Starting kernel ...

	OpenBSD/beagle booting ...

Alternatively you can manually boot OpenBSD when you hit any key
during the time-out and you will be presented with the following
prompt:

	OMAP3 beagleboard.org #

Now type 'mmc init' to check that the SD card has been found:

	OMAP3 beagleboard.org # mmc init
	mmc1 is available
	OMAP3 beagleboard.org # 

When the card has been found you should load the U-Boot image into memory:

	OMAP3 beagleboard.org # fatload mmc 0 0x80800000 bsd.umg
	reading bsd.umg

	2634332 bytes read
	OMAP3 beagleboard.org # 

To load that image from memory and thus boot OpenBSD type:

	OMAP3 beagleboard.org # bootm 0x80800000

Note that no ramdisk kernels are provided at this moment, so you won't
be able to actually install OpenBSD/MACHINE yet..
