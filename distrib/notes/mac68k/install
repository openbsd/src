The installation can be broken down into three basic steps:
	* Running Mkfs to build a filesystem or filesystems.
	* Running Install Utility to load the files onto your filesystems.
	* Running the booter to boot the system.

**** Preparing the filesystem(s)

Double-click on the Mkfs application icon to start it up.  It will ask
you for the SCSI ID of the drive that you are installing upon.  Once
this is selected, it will present a list of the partitions on that disk.
Select the partition on which you wish to build a filesystem and click
on the "Format" button.  You will now be asked for a bunch of parameters
for the hard drive and the filesystem.  Usually, you can just take the
defaults.  If you are installing onto a Syquest, please see the FAQ.
Note that although this dialog only has the "OK" button, you are not
committed, yet.  Once you get the values you want, press the "OK" button.
A dialog will be presented at this point with two options: "Format" and
"Cancel."  If you choose "Cancel," nothing will be written to your drive.
If you choose "Format," the program will proceed to make a filesystem.

Mkfs is not a well-behaved MacOS application.  It will not allow
any other tasks to run while it does (cooperative multitasking at its
best).  When it's finished, the program will put up a dialog to ask if
you have scanned the output for any error messages.  Usually there won't
have been any errors, but do scan the output to make sure.  Simply click
on the "I Read It" button and the program will quit.

Repeat as necessary for any extra partitions that you wish to make
filesystems on.  Note that you do _not_ need a filesystem on your swap
partition.

**** Installing the files

Double-click on the Install Utility icon to start it up.  The installer
will present the same SCSI ID menu that mkfs did.  Select the same SCSI
ID that you did for mkfs--i.e., the one you are installing onto.

If you are installing onto a single root partition, proceed to the
"Installation of base files" section, below.

	If you have not created filesystems for the root, usr, and
	any other partitions, go back to "Preparing the filesystem(s),"
	above.

	When you started the installer, it mounted your root partition.
	Just before it printed, "Mounting partition 'A' as /," it printed
	lines like:
		sd1 at scsi ID 5.
	This means that the device for scsi ID 5 is sd1.  The partitions
	are signified by a trailing letter.  For instance, sd1a would be
	the root partition of the second scsi disk in the chain, and sd0g
	would be the first usr partition on the first scsi disk.  It is
	important to emphasize that device numbers after the 'sd' do not
	correspond to SCSI IDs of disks but rather to logical disks.  The
	lowest SCSI ID will always be sd0 proceeded by increasing ID
	numbers.

	You will need to know the proper device to mount the remaining
	partition(s) by hand:

		* Select "Build Devices" from the "File" menu.  This builds
		  the necessary tree of device files on your filesystem in
		  /dev.

		* Select "Mini Shell" from the "File" menu.

		* Mount the filesystems you wish with the command:
			mount device path
		  For example, if you wish to mount the second partition from
		  the first scsi disk, sd0, on /usr, you would type:
			mount /dev/sd0b /usr

		* Type "quit" to exit the minishell after you have mounted
		  all the filesystems.

Installation of base files:

	Select the "Install" menu item from the "File" menu and install
	base{:--:}OSrev.tar.gz, bsd-generic.tar.gz, comp{:--:}OSrev.tar.gz, and any other 
	packages you wish to install at this time (see the contents section 
	for information about what's in each package).  The installer will
	print out the filename of each file as it is installed and will
	take quite some time to install everything.

	As is the case with Mkfs, this is not a particularly well-behaved
	MacOS application and the machine will be completely tied up
	while the installation takes place.

	At some point after installing the base package, select the "Build
	Devices" option from the "File" menu.  This will create a bunch of
	device nodes for you in /dev and your initial /etc/fstab.  The
	installer program also has an option to give you a mini-shell.

**** Booting the system

Double-click on the BSD/Mac68k Booter icon to start the application.  Check
that the options in the Booting dialog look sane--especially the SCSI ID.
If not, correct them to your preference.  When you are satisfied with
your choices, try booting OpenBSD.

If you wish to save your preferences, choose the "Save Preferences"
option in the "File" menu, then quit the application and restart.  Due
to a long-standing bug, the preferences will not be saved unless you
quit.
