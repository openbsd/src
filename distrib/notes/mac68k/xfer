Installation is really only supported from the local Macintosh
hard drive or from an AppleShare volume.  This means that you'll
need at least enough room for the largest file that you will have
to install.  This is the 6.2M base23 file.  There has been talk
of allowing an install from split files.  If you have the time,
desire, and knowledge, please feel free to add that functionality.

You will also need to collect the MacOS tools:
	Mkfs,
	BSD Install Utility, and
	BSD/Mac68k Booter.

These three are compacted and in binhex form as mkfs.hqx,
installer.hqx, and booter.sea.hqx, respectively.

Extract them as you would any other Macintosh applications.  The
source code for these utilities should be in the same directory with the
word "src" somewhere in the filename.
