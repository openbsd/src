Installation is really only supported from the local Macintosh hard drive or
from an AppleShare volume.  This means that you'll need at least enough room
on the HFS partition or AppleShare volume for the largest file that you will
have to install.

You will also need to collect the following Mac OS tools:
	Mkfs,
	BSD Install Utility, and
	BSD/Mac68k Booter.

These three are compacted and in binhex form as mkfs.hqx,
installer.hqx, and booter.sea.hqx, respectively.

Extract them as you would any other Macintosh applications.  The
source code for these utilities should be in the same directory with the
word "src" somewhere in the filename.
