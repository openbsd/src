Find your favorite disk partitioning utility.  Some
of the ones that have been tried and seem to work are:
	SCSI Directory Lite
	Disk Manager Mac from OnTrack
	HD SC Setup from Apple
	I/O Formatter from Diversified (?)
	Silverlining from LaCie

** First, be sure you have a reliable backup of any data
** which you may want to keep.  All information on the hard
** drive you will be repartitioning will be lost.

That done, use your favorite partitioning utility to make
at least one A/UX "Root & Usr" partition and an A/UX "Swap"
partition.  The "Root & Usr" partition should be _at least_
50MB in size if you wish to install all the sets.  This partition
will be the root partition of your OpenBSD system.

Generally, you should allocate twice as much swap space as you have real
memory (so, if you have 8MB of RAM, specify 16MB of swap space).
Systems that will be heavily used or that are low on real
memory should have more swap space allocated.  Systems that
will be only lightly used can get away with less.

If you like, you can also create a smaller root partition
and a larger /usr.  If you plan to use this machine as a
server, you may also want a separate /var.  Create these
partitions as the BSD "usr" or "User slice X" type.

You are now set to install OpenBSD on your hard drive.
