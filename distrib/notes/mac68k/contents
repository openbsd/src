	bsd.tgz		The OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV kernel binary. You MUST
			install either this file or bsd-sbc.tgz below. It is
			the kernel that you need to boot the system.

	bsd-sbc.tgz	Another OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV kernel binary. This is
			identical in every way to bsd.tgz except that it
			enables a different SCSI driver which may allow some
			otherwise incompatible SCSI disks to function with
			OpenBSD/MACHINE.  You must install either this or
			bsd.tgz.

	utils/		The MACHINE installation utilities for Mac OS.

The directory '../OSREV/MACHINE/utils' contains a number of utilities for the
Mac OS to aid the installation and configuration of OpenBSD.  The files are
distributed in Macintosh BinHex format, which is used to make SEA (Self-
Extracting Archive) files, which are then used to make the executables.  The
files in this directory are as follows:

	Booter1.11.3.sea.hqx
		 This Mac OS program is used to load the OpenBSD kernel and
		 start the operating system.  In all cases, you will need to
		 download this file.

	Installer_1.2.sea.hqx
		 This is the Mac OS program used to install downloaded sets
		 (such as those from the bins directory) onto a BSD partition.
		 It is necessary in either the case of a fresh install or an
		 upgrade.

	Mkfs_1.45.sea.hqx
		 A Mac OS program to build BSD filesystems on various
		 partitions you have created (see below).  You will need this
		 if you are performing a new installation.
