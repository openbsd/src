The directory '../OSREV/MACHINE/utils' contains a number of utilities for the
MacOS to aid the installation and configuration of OpenBSD.  The files are
distributed in Macintosh BinHex format, which is used to make SEA (Self-
Extracting Archive) files, which are then used to make the executables.  The
files in this directory are as follows:

	Booter1.11.3.sea.hqx
		 This MacOS program is used to load the OpenBSD kernel and
		 start the operating system.  In all cases, you will need to
		 download this file.
		 [ 141K binhexed, 110K SEA, 99K executable, 182K doc ]

	Installer_1.3.sea.hqx
		 This is the MacOS program used to install downloaded sets
		 (such as those from the bins directory) onto a BSD partition.
		 It is necessary in either the case of a fresh install or an
		 upgrade.
		 [ 131K binhexed, 105K SEA, 165K executable ]

	Mkfs_1.47.sea.hqx
		 A MacOS program to build BSD filesystems on various
		 partitions you have created (see below).  You will need this
		 if you are performing a new installation.
		 [ 78K binhexed, 66K SEA, 72K executable ]
