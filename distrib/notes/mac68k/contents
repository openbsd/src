The directory '../OSREV/mac68k/utils' contains a number of utilities for the
MacOS to aid the installation and configuration of OpenBSD.  The files in
this directory are as follows:

	Booter1.11.1.sea.hqx
		This MacOS program is used to load the OpenBSD kernel and
		start the operating system.  In all cases, you will need to
		download this file.

	Installer_1.1g.sea.hqx
		This is the MacOS program used to install downloaded sets
		(such as those from the bins directory) onto a BSD partition.
		It is necessary in either the case of a fresh install or an
		upgrade.

	Mkfs_1.45.sea.hqx
		A MacOS program to build BSD filesystems on various
		partitions you have created (see below).  You will need this
		if you are performing a new installation.
