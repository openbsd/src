MacOS to aid the installation and configuration of OpenBSD.  The files in
this directory are as follows:

	Booter1.11.1.sea.hqx

		 start the operating system.  In all cases, you will need to
		 download this file.

	Installer_1.1g.sea.hqx
		 This is the MacOS program used to install downloaded sets
		 (such as those from the bins directory) onto a BSD partition.
		 It is necessary in either the case of a fresh install or an
		 upgrade.

	Mkfs_1.45.sea.hqx
		 A MacOS program to build BSD filesystems on various
		 partitions you have created (see below).  You will need this
		 if you are performing a new installation.
