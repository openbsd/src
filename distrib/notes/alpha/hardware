OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV is expected to run on the following hardware.
If you have hardware that is listed here and are unable to run
OpenBSD, or if you are able to run OpenBSD on hardware not listed
here, please send mail to <tech@openbsd.org> with as much information
as possible.

Supported hardware:

	DEC 3000/[3456789]00 series with the following peripherals:

		Supported hardware:
			Built-in serial ports.
			Built-in LANCE ethernet.
			Built-in SCSI chips (53c[f]94), though both
			    may not work at the same time.

		Things that may work but haven't been tested:
			TurboChannel option slot LANCE (PMAD-A).

		Things are *not* supported at this time:
			Frame buffers of any type.
			Other TurboChannel option boards.
			The ISDN/Audio chip.

	AlphaStation {200,250,255,400,500} and AXPpci systems
	    (including the Multia) using the following peripherals:

		Supported hardware:
			NCR 53c810 SCSI (built-in or PCI board).
			Built-in ns16550 serial ports.
			DC21040-based ethernet (built-in or PCI board).
			DC21140-based PCI ethernet boards.
			DC21050-based PCI-PCI bridges (though other
			    types of PCI-PCI bridges should work).
			PCI VGA video boards.
			DEC ZLXp-E1 (DC21030-based, "TGA") video boards.
			PCI and ISA NE2000-compatible ethernet cards.
			SMC/WD 8003, 8013, and the SMC "Elite16" ISA boards.
			Integrated AXPpci33 and other ISA IDE controllers,
			    and associated disks.
				[Note: With single ATAPI device IDE busses, the
				ATAPI device should be set to SLAVE.]
			Keyboard.
			PS/2-style mice.

		Things that may work but haven't been tested:
			Built-in parallel ports.
			ISA ns16x50-family serial port boards.
			ISA ns16x50 multi-port serial boards.
			Other NCR 53c8xx SCSI boards.
			ST506/MFM/ESDI ISA controllers.

		Things that are *not* supported at this time:
			ISA VGA boards.
			Sound hardware (including Windows Sound System
			    built-in on some machines).
			DEC ZLXp-E2 and ZLXp-E3 PCI video boards.
			The built-in scsi controller on the AlphaStation 600.
			PCI boards not listed above.
			The floppy drive.
			IDE controllers (including the built-in IDE
			    controller on some machines).

At this time none of the following systems are supported:
	DECpc AXP 150 systems (EISA-bus PC-like systems)
	Alpha "server" systems (other than perhaps the AlphaServer
	    400, which might be an AlphaStation 400 in disguise).
	Multiprocessor Alpha systems

Console frame buffers and keyboards are only supported on systems
explicately mentioned above.  On other systems, including all
TurboChannel-based machines, OpenBSD/Alpha *must* be used with a
serial console.  Setting an Alpha system to use a serial console
is system-specific.  The procedure for most common hardware is:

	DEC 3000/[4-9]00's:
		Flip the appropriate switch on the back of the machine.

	DEC 3000/300 family machines:
		Boot the machine with the keyboard/mouse connector
		unplugged.

	AlphaStations, AXPpci systems and most others:
		Get to the SRM console prompt.  Enter "set console serial",
		then enter "init" or cycle power.

See your owner's manual for more details on how to set your machine
to use a serial console.
