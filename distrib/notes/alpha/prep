OpenBSD/MACHINE requires the SRM console.  Some alphas come with
the ARC firmware instead (this is what Windows NT uses).  It is
fairly simple to replace the ARC firmware with the SRM version.
You can get replacement firmware either from a firmware update
CD or via ftp from ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/.
Please refer to http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/readme.html
for more information.

AXPpci33 Motherboard specific notes:
    The 1994 version of the OEM guide has an incorrect pinout
    for the serial ports.  The newer version from
    ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/axppci/design_guide.ps.Z
    has a corrected pinout (as well as more information than
    the 1994 edition).  Note that there are two flavors
    of PC serial connectors.  If you have the wrong kind,
    you won't get any output from the serial console.

Using the SRM console:
    This is not intended to be an exhaustive guide on using the
    SRM firmware console.  It should, however, give you enough
    information to boot OpenBSD/MACHINE.

    To see a list of devices connected to your alpha, you can
    use the "show device" command.  For booting the devices you
    are interested in are "dva0" (the floppy drive) and
    "dka*" (the disk drives).

    You can set ROM variables by saying "set VARIABLE VALUE".
    Some variables you will want to set:
	auto_action	Determines what happens when you turn power on,
			halt, or crash your machine.  Valid values
			{:-include-:} "halt", "boot", and "restart".
			Most users will want to set this to "boot".
	bootdef_dev	Default boot device (or list of devices).
	boot_file	Name of the kernel to boot.  If this variable is
			empty, "bsd" will be loaded.
	boot_osflags	Flags to pass to the kernel.
			IMPORTANT! For multiuser boot, this needs to be
			set to "-a".
	booted_osflags	Don't try to set this one directly.  It will
			contain whatever flags the OS was last booted
			with.
			To set it indirectly, boot with the -flags
			option; for example "b dka0 -flags a" will boot
			multiuser from dka0 and set booted_osflags to "a".
    To see a list of all variables on your machine use the "show"
    command with no arguments.


dnl Change back when TC support is back
dnl On systems with no framebuffer supported, including all
dnl TurboChannel-based machines, OpenBSD/MACHINE must be used with a
dnl serial console.  Setting an Alpha system to use a serial console
dnl is system-specific.  The procedure for most common hardware is:
dnl
dnl	DEC 3000/[4-9]00's:
dnl		Flip the appropriate switch on the back of the machine.
dnl
dnl	DEC 3000/300 family machines:
dnl		Boot the machine with the keyboard/mouse connector
dnl		unplugged.
dnl
dnl	Other machines running the SRM console on local display:
dnl		Get to the SRM console prompt.  Enter "set console serial",
dnl		then enter "init" or cycle power.
dnl
On systems with no framebuffer supported, OpenBSD/MACHINE must be used
with a serial console.  Setting an Alpha system to use a serial console
is system-specific.  From the SRM console on local display, enter
	set console serial
at the SRM prompt, then enter
	init
or cycle power.

See your owner's manual for more details on how to set your machine
to use a serial console.

dnl Uncomment when TC support is back
dnl Note that some MACHINE computers currently *require* a serial console
dnl and can't be used from a regular keyboard/display console, even though
dnl the motherboard has appropriate connectors.
dnl Currently, only the TurboChannel MACHINE computers (DEC 3000) require use
dnl of a serial console.
dnl
If booting using the regular console aborts with ``not configured to use
display && keyboard console'', then you need to use a serial console.
dnl If your machine was not listed in the list above, please report this on
dnl <alpha@openbsd.org>.
If this is the case, please report this on <alpha@openbsd.org>.
