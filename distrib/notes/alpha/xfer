Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM (NOT supported if booting from floppy)
	FFS partitions
	HTTP

If you can burn the bootable CD-ROM mini image, you can boot from it.
Otherwise, you will need to create a bootable floppy disk.

If you neither have a floppy drive nor a CD-ROM drive on your alpha:

	If you don't have a floppy drive you can copy the floppy
	image onto the hard disk you intend to install OpenBSD on.
	Doing so will overwrite the disk's old contents, however.

	You must use a UN*X-like system to write the floppy image
	to the hard disk you will be using for OpenBSD/MACHINE.  You
	should use the "dd" command to copy the file system image
	(floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs or floppyB{:--:}OSrev.fs) directly to the raw 'c'
	device (whole disk) of the target hard disk.  It is suggested
	that you read the dd(1) manual page or ask your system
	administrator to determine the correct set of arguments to use;
	it will be slightly different from system to system, and a
	comprehensive list of the possibilities is beyond the scope of
	this document.

	Please note that this will put a floppy disklabel on your
	disk which will confuse the install script.  To fix this
	you need to ask for a shell (answer "s" to the first question)
	when booting your disk and do "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd0c
	count=20", assuming you booted from sd0.  After doing this you will
	not be able to boot that disk again unless you complete
	the install.  You can now enter "install" and start the
	actual install process.
