There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk.  The easiest way
is to boot from the OpenBSD CD-ROM.  You can also use one of the OpenBSD
installation floppies, if your machine has a floppy drive.

Booting from Floppy Disk installation media:

	At the SRM console prompt, enter "boot dva0" and hit return.
	You should see info about the primary and secondary boot
	and then the kernel should start to load.  It will take a
	while to load the kernel from the floppy, most likely more
	than a minute.  If some action doesn't eventually happen,
	or the spinning cursor has stopped and nothing further has
	happened, or the machine spontaneously reboots, then either
	either you have a bad boot floppy (in which case you should
	try another) or your alpha is not currently supported by OpenBSD.

Booting from CD-ROM installation media:

	At the SRM console prompt, enter "show device" and hit return
	to find the device ID of your CD-ROM drive (the device ID is
	in the second column and should start with DKA for a SCSI
	CD-ROM drive).  If your drive shows up with a drive number
	with trailing zeros, you will want to ignore them (unless
	it is DKA0).  For example, if your CD-ROM drive is listed
	as DKA600, you want to use dka6 (device ID's are case
	insensitive).
	Insert the OpenBSD/MACHINE CD and enter
	"boot -fi OSREV/MACHINE/bsd.rd DEVICE"
	where DEVICE is the dka device name.  Note that the argument
	order is important here.
	You should see info about the primary and secondary boot
	and then the kernel should start to load.  If the kernel
	fails to load or the spinning cursor has stopped and nothing
	further has happened, you either have a hardware problem or
	your alpha is not currently supported by OpenBSD; try booting
	from a floppy instead.


Installing using the Floppy or CD-ROM procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

OpenBSDBootMsgs

	If you boot from a floppy, you will probably see several
	warnings.  You should be warned that the kernel can't figure
	out what device it booted from and that no swap space is
	present.  Do not be alarmed, these are completely normal.
	The first warning occurs because while OpenBSD/MACHINE can
	boot from the floppy drive, the kernel itself lacks a floppy
	driver.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  If you are
	installing from a non-serial console, the default of "sun"
	is correct.  If you are installing from a serial console
	you should choose the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt100).

 The flags usually carry the following
	meaning:

		-link0 -link1	Use BNC (coaxial) port [default]
		link0 -link1	Use AUI port
		link0 link1	Use UTP (twisted pair) port
