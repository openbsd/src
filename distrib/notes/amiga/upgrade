The upgrade to OpenBSD 2.3 is a binary upgrade; it would be prohibitive
to make users upgrade by compiling and installing the 2.3 sources, and
it would be very difficult to even compile a set of instructions that
allowed them to do so.

To do the upgrade, and if you are using the miniroot installation, you
must have the OpenBSD kernel on AmigaDOS and you must transfer the root
filesystem miniroot23.fs onto the swap partition of the OpenBSD hard disk.
If you are using the ramdisk installation, the bsd.rd kernel is enough.
You must also have at least the "base23" binary distribution set available,
so that you can upgrade with it, using one of the upgrade methods described
above.  Finally, you must have sufficient disk space available to install
the new binaries.  Since the old binaries are being overwritten in place,
you only need space for the new binaries, which weren't previously
on the system.  If you have a few megabytes free on each of your
root and /usr partitions, you should have enough space.

Since upgrading involves replacing the kernel, and most of the system
binaries, it has the potential to cause data loss.  You are strongly
advised to BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT DATA ON YOUR DISK, whether on the
OpenBSD partition or on another operating system's partition, before
beginning the upgrade process.

To upgrade your system, follow the following instructions:

	If you know you need an -I option to loadbsd, you should add it
	to the loadbsd invocation you'll use for the upgrade.

	Miniroot installation:

	Transfer the upgrade miniroot filesystem onto the hard disk
	partition used by OpenBSD for swapping, as described in the
	"Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation" section above.

	Now boot up OpenBSD using the 2.3 kernel using the loadbsd
	command:

		loadbsd -b bsd

	You should see the screen clear and some information about
	your system as the kernel configures the hardware.  Note which
	hard disk device is configured that contains your root and
	swap partition.  When prompted for the root device, type
	'sd0*' (replacing 0 with the disk number that OpenBSD used for
	your root/swap device).  The '*' character indicates that the
	root filesystem is contained on the swap partition.  Continue
	reading below the ramdisk installation description:

	Ramdisk installation:

	Now boot up OpenBSD using the 2.3 kernel using the loadbsd
	command:

		loadbsd bsd.rd

	You should see the screen clear and some information about
	your system as the kernel configures the hardware.

	Common instructions for both miniroot/ramdisk installations:

	When you reach the prompt asking you for a shell name, just
	hit return.

	You will be asked which terminal type to use, you should just
	hit return to select the default (vt220).

	At the question whether to (I)nstall or (U)pgrade choose "U".

	You will be presented with some information about the upgrade
	process and a warning message, and will be asked if you wish
	to proceed with the upgrade process.  If you answer
	negatively, the upgrade process will stop, and your disk will
	not be modified.  If you answer affirmatively, the upgrade
	process will begin, and your disk will be modified.  You may
	hit Control-C to stop the upgrade process at any time.
	However, if you hit it at an inopportune moment, your system
	may be left in an inconsistent (and possibly unusable) state.

	The upgrade program will then chack & mount your root filesystem
	under /mnt and grab some configuration info from it for the
	continued upgrade process.  You'll be asked if the network
	should be enabled at this point.  After that is done the rest
	of the filesystems will be checked and mounted.

	If you don't already have the OpenBSD distribution sets on your
	disk, look in the installation section for information on how
	to transfer them to your disk.

	Once the distribution sets are transferred to your disk,
	continue here.  (Obviously, if the OpenBSD distribution sets
	are already on your disk, because you've transferred them
	before starting the upgrade process, you don't need to
	transfer them again now!)

	After the software has been transferred to the machine (or
	mounted, in the case of upgrading via NFS).

Your system has now been upgraded to OpenBSD 2.3.

	After all this, your machine is a complete OpenBSD 2.3 system.
	However, that doesn't mean that you're finished with the upgrade
	process.  There are several things that you should do, or might
	have to do, to insure that the system works properly.

	First, you will probably want to get the etc23.tar.gz distribution,
	extract it, and compare its contents with those in your /etc/
	directory.  You will probably want to replace some of your
	system configuration files, or incorporate some of the changes
	in the new versions into yours.

	Second, you might want to check your /dev against the new MAKEDEV
	script found there, if you have changed the nodes locally.  The
	upgrade process runs "sh MAKEDEV all" but that may not be enough
	for your personal setup.

	Third, you must deal with certain changes in the formats of
	some of the configuration files.  The most notable change is
	that the "options" given to many of the file systems in
	/etc/fstab or by hand have changed, and some of the file
	systems have changed names.  To find out what the new options
	are, it's suggested that you read the manual page for the
	file systems' mount commands, for example mount_nfs(8) for
	NFS.  (Note that the information for mounts of type "ufs",
	i.e. Fast File Systems, are contained in the mount(8) man
	page.)

	Finally, you will want to delete old binaries that were part
	of the version of OpenBSD that you upgraded from and have since
	been removed from the OpenBSD distribution.  You might also
	want to recompile any locally-built binaries, to take
	advantage of the shared libraries.  (Note that any new
	binaries that you build will be dynamically linked, and
	therefore take advantage of the shared libraries, by default.
	For information on how to make statically linked binaries,
	see the cc(1) and ld(1) manual pages.)
