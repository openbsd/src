OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on any amiga that has a 68020, 68030, 68040 or
68060 CPU with some form of FPU and MMU.  It should also run on
MacroSystem's DraCo computer.
6MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and a minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 100MB partition by installing just the minimum sets.
To actually do much compiling or anything more interesting than
booting, more RAM and disk space is highly recommended. About 250MB will be
necessary to install all of the OpenBSD OSREV binary distribution (note that
this does not count swap space!).  Much more disk space is required to
install the source and objects as well (about another 600MB).
An AmigaDOS partition is also required to install OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV and
boot it, see below.
