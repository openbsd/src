OpenBSD/amiga 2.1 runs on any amiga that has a 68020, 68030, 68040 or
68060 CPU with some form of FPU and MMU.  The minimal configuration
requires 4M of RAM and about 75M of disk space.  To install the entire
system requires much more disk space, and to run X or compile the system,
more RAM is recommended.  (4M of RAM will actually allow you to
compile, however it won't be speedy.  X really isn't usable on a
4M system.)

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	20M	20M	15M	15M
	user (/usr)	95M	130M	75M 	110M
	swap		---- 1MB for every MB RAM ----
			-- but the sum of swap and ---
			- RAM should be at least 16 --

As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC and
INSTALL are large and bulky to accommodate all people).

If you only have 4M of fast memory, you should make your swap partition
larger, as your system will be doing much more swapping.
