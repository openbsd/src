The amiga-specific portion of the OpenBSD 2.3 release is found in the
"amiga" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../2.3/amiga/
		INSTALL.amiga	This file.

		CKSUM		Output of the cksum(1) and md5(1) programs
		MD5		usable for verification of the correctness
				of downloaded files.

		bsd		A generic OpenBSD kernel used both for
				miniroot installation and as the first
				"real" kernel your OpenBSD installation
				will use.

		bsd.rd		A ramdisk OpenBSD kernel used for simple
				installation.

		miniroot23.fs	A miniroot filesystem image to be used
				if you for some reason can't or don't
				want to use the ramdisk installation
				method.

		*.tar.gz	amiga binary distribution sets;
				see below.

		utils/		Miscellaneous amiga installation
				utilities; see installation section, below.

Installation/upgrade miniroot file system:

	This file contains a BSD root file system setup to help
	you install or upgrade the rest of OpenBSD.  This includes
	formatting root and /usr partitions in the case of an install
	or converting existing ones if doing an upgrade (this conversion
	is only needed if you are coming from a real old NetBSD world),
	then mounting your root and /usr partitions and getting
	ready to extract (and possibly first fetching) the distribution
	sets.  There is enough on this file system to allow you to
	make a slip or ppp connection, configure an Ethernet, mount an
	NFS file system or ftp.  You can also load distribution sets from
	a SCSI tape or from one of your existing AmigaDOS partitions.

	This file is named "miniroot23.fs".


The OpenBSD/amiga binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the OpenBSD 2.3 release for the amiga.  There are seven binary
distribution sets.  The binary distribution sets can be found in
the "amiga" subdirectory of the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution tree,
and are as follows:

	base23	The OpenBSD/amiga 2.3 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base OpenBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 11.2M gzipped, 33.9M uncompressed ]

	comp23	The OpenBSD/amiga Compiler tools.  The C, C++, and
		FORTRAN language environments are supported.  This set
		includes the system include files (/usr/include), the
		linker, the compiler tool chain, and the various system
		libraries (except the shared libraries, which are
		included as part of the base set).  This set also
		includes the manual pages for all of the utilities it
		contains, as well as the system call and library manual
		pages.
		[ 7.0M gzipped, 23.6M uncompressed ]

	etc23	This distribution set contains the system configuration
		files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
		This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ 92K gzipped, 490K uncompressed ]

	game23	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.7M gzipped, 6.7M uncompressed ]

	man23	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.4M gzipped, 9.2M uncompressed ]

	misc23	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.7M gzipped, 5.8M uncompressed ]

	text23	This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 945K gzipped, 3.5M uncompressed ]

	xbase23 This set includes the base X distribution.  This includes
		programs, headers, libraries, configuration files.

	xfont23 This set includes all of the X fonts.

	xserv23 This set includes all of the X servers.
