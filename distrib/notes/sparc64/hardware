		SPARCengineUltra AX

	- CompactPCI boards:
		SPARCengine CP1500
	- faithful clones of the above Sun systems.

If your machine is not listed above, it is very likely that OpenBSD/MACHINE
does not work on it (yet).

The minimal configuration requires 32M of RAM and ~160M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
	SCSI Host Adapters:
		SBus NCR53c9x adapters (esp)
		SBus 10/100Mbit SunSwift Ethernet+SCSI cards, aka HME + FAS366
		  cards (esp)
		SBus QLogic adapters (isp)
		PCI NCR53c8xx adapters (siop)

	PCI IDE Controllers: (pciide)
		Acer Labs M5229
		Command Technologies PCI0646
		National Semiconductor PC87415
		Other PCI IDE controllers may work, but have not been tested
