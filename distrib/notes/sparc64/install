OpenBSDInstallPrelude

There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk. The easiest way
in terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD installation
dnl XXX change back if more than one floppy again.
dnl cdrom, or an installation floppy.
cdrom, or the installation floppy.

If your machine is hooked up in a network and you can find a server to
arrange for a diskless setup, which is a convenient way to install on a
machine whose disk does not currently hold a usable operating system.
This is difficult to get set up correctly the first time, but easy to
use afterwards.  (see ``Installing using a diskless setup'' below).

It is also possible to install OpenBSD "manually" from a running Solaris
system, using the system tools, as well as gunzip; see ``Installing from
Solaris'' below.


Booting from the Installation Media:

Prior to attempting an installation, you should make sure that everything
of value on the target system has been backed up.  While installing OpenBSD
does not necessarily wipe out all the partitions on the hard disk, errors
during the install process can have unforeseen consequences and you will
probably render the system unbootable if you start, but do not complete
the installation.  Having the installation media for the prior installation,
be it a Solaris or OpenBSD CD-ROM or OpenBSD install diskettes is good
insurance if you want to be able to "go back" for some reason.

After taking care of all that, bring your system down gracefully using
the shutdown(8) and/or halt(8) commands.  This will get you to the monitor
prompt.


Booting from Floppy Disk installation media:

       ok boot floppy bsd

This will cause the kernel contained in the floppy to be booted.
Please note that PCI systems are not able to boot from floppy; also,
Ultra 1, 1E and 2 systems might need a firmware update to be able to boot
from floppy; refer to the ``Updating your firmware'' section earlier in
this document for details.


Booting From CD-ROM installation media:

dnl No args! not a typo
	ok boot cdrom

If the boot is successful, you will get a loader version message,
executable sizes and then the Kernel copyright and device probe
messages.  Boot failure modes are typically a lot of CD-ROM drive
activity, but no messages or complaints about magic numbers,
checksums or formats.


Booting from disk (miniroot or floppy image):

Boot the miniroot by typing the appropriate command at the PROM:

	ok boot disk:b bsd

If you've loaded the miniroot onto some other disk than the default
drive 0, modify the boot specifier accordingly, keeping in mind the
partition naming a=0, b=1... 

	ok boot disk1:b bsd     # example - scsi target 1 or
				# second ide drive

During the boot, the kernel might not be able to determine by itself
which device it has been booted from.  In this case, it will ask you
for the root and swap devices.  Answer the device and partition you
booted from as the root partition (likely sd0b or wd0b); you might
want to rely on the boot messages to find the correct device name
(see below).  When the kernel asks your for the swap device, just
validate the suggested device name; since the installation procedure
does not use swap, it doesn't matter.


Installing using a diskless setup:

First, you must setup a diskless client configuration on a server. If
you are using a OpenBSD system as the boot-server, have a look at the
diskless(8) manual page for guidelines on how to proceed with this.
If the server runs another operating system, you'll have to consult
documentation that came with it (on SunOS systems, add_client(8) and
the Sun System/Networks administrators guide constitute a good start;
on Solaris systems, share(1M) is a good starting point as well).


Boot your workstation from the server by entering the appropriate `boot'
command at the monitor prompt:

	ok boot net bsd.rd


Installing using the Floppy, CD-ROM, miniroot or netboot procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially from a floppy
	or slow network connection, most likely more than a minute.  If
	some action doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor has
	stopped and nothing further has happened, either your boot media
	is bad, your diskless setup isn't correct, or you may have
	a hardware or configuration problem.

OpenBSDBootMsgs

	While booting, you will probably see several warnings.  You
	may be warned that the kernel can't figure out what device
	it booted from.  Do not be alarmed, this is completely normal.
	This warning occurs because while OpenBSD/MACHINE can boot from
	the floppy drive, the kernel itself lacks a floppy driver.
	On some machines, you might also get this kind of warning:
	"No counter-timer -- using %tick at 179MHz as system clock."
	Unless the frequency displayed does not match your CPU speed,
	this is nothing to worry about.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  If you are
	installing from a keyboard/monitor console, the default of
	"sun" if correct.  If you are installing from a serial console
	you should choose the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt100).

	After entering the terminal type you will be asked whether you
	wish to do an "(I)nstall" or an "(U)pgrade".  Enter 'I' for a
	fresh install or 'U' to upgrade an existing installation.

	You will be presented with a welcome message and asked if
	you really want to continue. Assuming you answered yes, the
	install program will then tell you which disks of that type
	it can install on, and ask you which it should use.  The name
	of the disk is typically "sd0" for SCSI drives and "wd0" for
	IDE drives. Reply with the name of your disk.

	Next you will have to edit or create a disklabel for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  The installation script will
	invoke the text editor allowing you to do this.  Note that
	partition 'c' inside this disk label should ALWAYS reflect the
	entire disk, including any non-OpenBSD portions.  The root file
	system should be in partition 'a', and swap is usually in partition
	'b'.  It is recommended that you create separate partitions for
	root and /usr, you may also want to specify /var and /home
	partitions.

	The swap partition (usually 'b') should have a type of "swap", all
	other native OpenBSD partitions should have a type of "4.2BSD".
	Block and fragment sizes are usually 8192 and 1024 bytes, but can
	also be 16384 and 2048 bytes.

	The install program will now label your disk and ask which file
	systems should be created on which partitions.  It will auto-
	matically select the 'a' partition to be the root file system.
	Next it will ask for which disk and partition you want a file
	system created on.  This will be the same as the disk name (e.g.
	"sd0") with the letter identifying the partition (e.g. "d")
	appended (e.g. "sd0d").  Then it will ask where this partition is
	to be mounted, e.g. /usr.  This process will be repeated until
	you type "done".

	At this point you will be asked to confirm that the file system
	information you have entered is correct, and given an opportunity
	to change the file system table.  Next it will create the new file
	systems as specified, OVERWRITING ANY EXISTING DATA.  This is the
	point of no return.

	After all your file systems have been created, the install program
	will give you an opportunity to configure the network.  The network
	configuration you enter (if any) can then be used to do the install
	from another system using NFS, HTTP or FTP, and will also be the
	configuration used by the system after the installation is complete.

	If you select to configure the network, the install program will
	ask you for a name of your system and the DNS domain name to use.
	Note that the host name should be without the domain part, and that
	the domain name should NOT {:-include-:} the host name part.

	Next the system will give you a list of network interfaces you can
	configure.  For each network interface you select to configure, it
	will ask for the IP address to use, the symbolic host name to use,
	the netmask to use and any media flags to set. It is usually safe
	to keep the default settings.

	After all network interfaces have been configured the install pro-
	gram will ask for a default route and IP address of the primary
	name server to use.  You will also be presented with an opportunity
	to edit the host table.

	At this point you will be allowed to edit the file system table
	that will be used for the remainder of the installation and that
	will be used by the finished system, following which the new file
	systems will be mounted to complete the installation.

	After these preparatory steps have been completed, you will be
	able to extract the distribution sets onto your system.  There
	are several install methods supported; FTP, HTTP, tape, CD-ROM, NFS
	or a local disk partition.  Note that installation from floppies
	is not currently supported.

After completing an installation:

Now try a reboot.  (If needed, swap your scsi id's first).  Initially
I'd suggest you "boot sd()bsd -bs", then try multiuser after that.
if you boot single-user the OpenBSD incantation to make the root
filesystem writable is

    OpenBSD# mount -u /dev/sd0a /

The UltraSPARC OpenFirmware will normally load the kernel from the device
and filename as instructed by the ``boot-device'' and ``boot-file''
variables.  If the ``boot-file'' variable is empty, the OpenBSD bootloader
will look for a kernel named ``bsd'', unless a different filename has been
specified in the boot command.  To reset this variable to its default,
empty, value, type the following:

    ok set-default boot-file


OpenBSDCongratulations

If you will be running your OpenBSD system from a serial console, you may
need to edit /etc/ttys and change the terminal type, and getty method from
"sun" and "suncons" to "vt100" and "std.9600" or something similar.  Also
when running from a serial console, you may wish to adjust the eeprom
settings for input-device, output-device, screen-#columns, and screen-#rows
as appropriate.  

In order to use 'tip' on OpenBSD/MACHINE, you'll need to edit /etc/ttys
and add "local" to the end of the tty configuration line, and run 
'ttyflags -a' to put your changes into effect.


Installing from Solaris:

You need a machine running under Solaris to install OpenBSD.  You will
also need at least the following pieces:

  - the *.tgz files you want to install (as a minimum, base{:--:}OSrev.tgz and
    etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz)
  - gunzip (GNU gzip) Solaris binary
  - a boot block file from a Solaris machine that matches your machine type,
    for ufs filesystem, such as /usr/platform/`uname -i`/lib/fs/ufs/bootblk
  - an OpenBSD kernel

All these pieces, except the boot block and the GNU utilities are supplied
in the OpenBSD/MACHINE distribution.

You need to format and partition the disk using Solaris (since
OpenBSD/MACHINE uses Sun compatible disk labels.)  Give yourself adequate
partition sizes.  Here is an example layout:

    solaris# prtvtoc -s /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2
    *                          First     Sector    Last
    * Partition  Tag  Flags    Sector     Count    Sector  Mount Directory
           0      2    00          0     80000     79999   /
           1      3    01      80000    256000    335999
           2      5    00          0   4165271   4165270
           3      7    00     336000    100000    435999   /tmp
           4      7    00     436000    100000    535999   /var
           5      7    00     536000    400000    935999   /var/tmp
           6      4    00     936000   3229271   4165270   /usr

Use Solaris to newfs the partitions which will have filesystems on them.
(OpenBSD's filesystem format is almost identical to Solaris).

    solaris# newfs /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s0
    [... lots of output]
 
Repeat for any other partition (in this example, /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s3,
/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s4, /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s5 and /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s6).

dnl XXX I had no time to check the -O restriction is still necessary.
NOTE: If you are able to, there is a performance benefit from
newfs'ing using OpenBSD.  If you newfs using the OpenBSD newfs command,
be sure to use the -O flag for your / partition, so that newfs will
use the 4.3BSD filesystem format, rather than the new 4.4BSD filesystem
format.  If you forget, you will not be able to boot -- the Solaris boot
blocks do not understand the extended 4.4BSD filesystem format.

Mount those partitions in a tree formation, under /mnt; ie:

    solaris# df -k
    Filesystem            kbytes    used   avail capacity  Mounted on
    [...]
    /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s0      38427       0   38427     0%    /mnt
    /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s3      48249       0   48249     0%    /mnt/tmp
    /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s4      48249       0   48249     0%    /mnt/var
    /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s5     193536       0  193536     0%    /mnt/var/tmp
    /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s6    1564024       0 1564024     0%    /mnt/usr

Place the boot block in /mnt (your new root partition), and use the Solaris
command "installboot" to make it work.
The installboot man page says to do something like this:

    solaris# cp /usr/platform/`uname -i`/lib/fs/ufs/bootblk /mnt/bootblk
    solaris# sync; sync
    solaris# /usr/sbin/installboot /mnt/bootblk /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s0

You can now extract the provided "*.tgz files onto your disk.

    solaris# ls -FC
    base{:--:}OSrev.tgz     etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz      misc{:--:}OSrev.tgz     xserv{:--:}OSrev.tgz
    bsd            game{:--:}OSrev.tgz     xbase{:--:}OSrev.tgz    xshare{:--:}OSrev.tgz
    comp{:--:}OSrev.tgz     man{:--:}OSrev.tgz      xfont{:--:}OSrev.tgz
    solaris{:-#-:} gunzip < base{:--:}OSrev.tgz | (cd /mnt; tar xvpf -)
    [...] for each set

And finally copy the OpenBSD kernel onto your disk.

    solaris# cp bsd /mnt/bsd

The GNU gunzip program is not distributed as part of Solaris, but may be
present in your /usr/local/bin.  If not, you will need to obtain it from a
GNU archive and install before proceeding.

After the files have been extracted, setup /mnt/etc/fstab to match
your actual disk layout.  (Minus the "/mnt" component of each path, of
course :-)

Now proceed to reboot the machine and the customize your installation.


Net Boot or Diskless Setup Information:

The set up is similar to the diskless setup, but not identical, because
the Sun setup assumes that the bootblocks load a kernel image, which then
uses NFS to access the exported root partition, while the OpenBSD bootblocks
use internal NFS routines to load the kernel image directly from the
exported root partition.

Please understand that no one gets this right the first try, since
there is a lot of setup and all the host daemons must be running and
configured correctly.  If you have problems, extract the diskless(8)
manpage, find someone who's been through it before and use the host
syslog and tcpdump(8) to get visibility of what's happening (or not).

Your UltraSPARC expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap
program via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RevARP when
instructed to boot "over the net". It will look for a filename composed of
the machine's IP address. For example, a machine which has been assigned IP
address 130.115.144.11, will make an TFTP request for `8273900B'.
Normally, this file is a symbolic link to an appropriate second-stage
boot program, which should be located in a place where the TFTP daemon
can find it (remember, many TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).

You can find the boot program in `/usr/mdec/boot' in the OpenBSD/MACHINE
distribution.

After the boot program has been loaded into memory and given control by
the PROM, it starts locating the machine's remote root directory through
the BOOTPARAM protocol. First a BOOTPARAM WHOAMI request is broadcast
on the local net. The answer to this request (if it comes in) contains
the client's name. This name is used in next step, a BOOTPARAM GETFILE
request -- sent to the server that responded to the WHOAMI request --
requesting the name and address of the machine that will serve the client's
root directory, as well as the path of the client's root on that server.

Finally, this information (if it comes in) is used to issue a REMOTE MOUNT
request to the client's root filesystem server, asking for an NFS file
handle corresponding to the root filesystem. If successful, the boot
program starts reading from the remote root filesystem in search of the
kernel which is then read into memory.

You will want export the miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs filesystem to the client.  You
can dd this filesystem image to some spare partition, mount and export
that partition or use tar to copy the contents to a more convenient spot.

Alternatively you can build a bootable partition from the distribution sets
as follows:

Unpack `base{:--:}OSrev.tgz' and `etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz' on the server in the root directory
for your target machine. If you elect to use a separately NFS-mounted
filesystem for `/usr' with your diskless setup, make sure the "./usr" base
files in base{:--:}OSrev.tgz end up in the correct location. One way to do this is
to temporarily use a loopback mount on the server, re-routing <root>/usr to
your server's exported OpenBSD "/usr" directory. Also put the kernel and
the install/upgrade scripts into the root directory.

A few configuration files need to be edited:

	<root>/etc/hosts
		Add the IP addresses of both server and client.

	<root>/etc/myname
		This files contains the client's hostname; use the same
		name as in <root>/etc/hosts.

	<root>/etc/fstab
		Enter the entries for the remotely mounted filesystems.
		For example:
			server:/export/root/client       /     nfs  rw 0 0
			server:/export/exec/MACHINE.OpenBSD /usr  nfs  rw 0 0

Now you must populate the the `/dev' directory for your client. If you server
runs SunOS 4.x, you can simply change your working directory to `<root>/dev'
and run the MAKEDEV script: `sh MAKEDEV all'.

On Solaris (SunOS 5.x) systems, MAKEDEV can also be used, but there'll be
error messages about unknown user and groups. These errors are
inconsequential for the purpose of installing OpenBSD. However, you may
want to correct them if you plan to the diskless setup regularly. In that
case, you may re-run MAKEDEV on your OpenBSD machine once it has booted.
