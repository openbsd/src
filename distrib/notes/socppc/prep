To be able to boot the OpenBSD/MACHINE installation program on the
Thecus N1200, you will need to learn a bit about Das U-Boot, the
low-level process that controls the microprocessor after hardware
initialization.  On the RouterBOARD RB600A, that task is handled by
RouterBOOT.

Talking to the Thecus

The Thecus N1200 needs a serial cable. On the back of the disk drive
circuit board, there is either a 10-pin header (with one pin removed),
or 9 holes for you to solder in your own header.  The ribbon cable
that connects from there to your serial cable or the serial port on
your computer is of the same type as used on older i386 PCs, but
be aware that there are two different types of 10-pin IDC to DB-9M
ribbon cable in use, which look identical (the differences are hidden
inside the DB-9 connector). The cable you need is wired using the
"AT-Everex" or "Asus" pinout, as described here:

    http://www.pccables.com/07120.htm

and *not* the more straightforward to solder "crossed" type:

    http://www.pccables.com/07121.htm.

If you wish to check a cable, or make your own, the pinouts are:

    DB9           IDC10
    ===           =====
    1 2 3 4 5     1 3 5 7 9
     6 7 8 9      2 4 6 8 10

Wire pin 1 to 1, 2 to 2 etc, with 10 not connected.


Booting Thecus N1200

When you have connected your computer, a command like "tip -115200 tty00"
(assuming you're using the first serial port on your machine) should 
connect you to the Thecus console. Now apply power to the Thecus
and start it.

After some device probe information, you should see this prompt:

    Hit any key to stop autoboot:  1

You have exactly one second to press a key and enter interactive
U-Boot.  Fortunately it will typically accept a key typed during the
diagnostics that precede this prompt.

The recommended way to boot OpenBSD on Thecus is to configure networking and
load bsd.bin from a TFTP server. First networking must be configured
using the setenv command.

    => setenv ipaddr 10.0.0.21
    => setenv serverip 10.0.0.7
    => setenv gatewayip 10.0.0.7

Once you have done this, and have set up your TFTP server on
the gateway machine (10.0.0.7 in the above example), you can
boot manually.

    => tftpboot 200000 bsd.bin
    Speed: 1000, full duplex
    Using Freescale TSEC0 device
    TFTP from server 10.0.0.7; our IP address is 10.0.0.21
    Filename 'bsd.bin'.
    Load address: 0x200000
    Loading: ##########################################################
          #############################################################
          ...
          ######
    done
    Bytes transferred = 295148 (480ec hex)
    => go 200000

If you then install to your hard disk, in future you can
load the OpenBSD/socppc boot loader

    => tftpboot 200000 boot
    => bootm

and just hit "return" to boot OpenBSD.


Automatic Booting

However, for easier booting, you may wish to modify the flash
memory so that the Thecus will boot automatically into OpenBSD
when it is powered up.

    => erase fe780000 fe800000
    
    .... done
    Erased 4 sectors
    => tftpboot 200000 boot
    Speed: 1000, full duplex
    Using Freescale TSEC0 device
    TFTP from server 10.0.0.7; our IP address is 10.0.0.21
    Filename 'boot'.
    Load address: 0x200000
    Loading: ##########################################################
    done
    Bytes transferred = 295148 (480ec hex)
    => cp 200000 fe780000 20000
    Copy to Flash... 
    512 KBdone
    => setenv bootcmd bootm FE780000
    => saveenv
    Saving Environment to Flash...
    Un-Protected 2 sectors
    Erasing Flash...
    .. done
    Erased 2 sectors
    Writing to Flash... 
    256 KBdone
    Protected 2 sectors
    => reset

This configuration can easily be set back to the default, as the
Linux system does not get erased from the flash memory. To set it
back, just change the boot script with fconfig back to what it was,
for example:

    => setenv bootcmd flashboot
    => saveenv

The bootloader is command driven with timeout like many other OpenBSD
architectures.

It may be needed to increase the 'bootdelay' variable in order to give
the SATA-chip a chance to initialize. Having a too short delay could cause
OpenBSD/socppc to not find it's root device (and thus kernel image).
In some cases as much as ten seconds are needed for the delay, although
five seconds will do in most cases:

    => setenv bootdelay 5
    => saveenv


Booting the RouterBOARD RB600A

The RouterBOARD RB600A comes with a standard DB9 serial port, so no
special cables are needed.  Like the Thecus, the default baudrate is
115200, so a command like "tip -115200 tty00" should connect you to
the RouterBOARD console.  As soon as you apply power to the
RouterBOARD, it will start booting.

Shortly after RouterBOOT starts, you will see a message like:

    Press any key within 2 seconds to enter setup.

Since board initailization is very fast, it is rather easy to miss
this message, in which case the board will load its RouterOS (which is
just Linux) from flash.

The recommended way to install OpenBSD on the RouterBOARD is to copy
the miniroot "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs" image to CompactFlash on another
machine and place in the first (J301) CompactFlash slot on the board.  

Use the dd(1) utility to copy the miniroot to CompactFlash.
The command would likely be, under OpenBSD:
	dd if=miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rsd1c
Replace ``rsd1c'' with the appropriate device name for the raw device
on the system used to do the copy.

You will need to configure your RouterBOARD to boot from CompactFlash.
To do this, enter the RouterBOOT setup by pressing a key when the
message show above appears on the serial console.  This should present
you with the following menu:

    RouterBOOT-2.20
    What do you want to configure?
       d - boot delay
       k - boot key
       s - serial console
       o - boot device
       f - cpu frequency
       r - reset booter configuration
       e - format nand
       g - upgrade firmware
       i - board info
       p - boot protocol
       t - do memory testing
       x - exit setup
    your choice: 

Choose 'o' to enter the boot device menu:

    Select boot device:
       e - boot over Ethernet
     * n - boot from NAND, if fail then Ethernet
       c - boot from CompactFlash only
       1 - boot Ethernet once, then NAND
       2 - boot Ethernet once, then CompactFlash
       o - boot from NAND only
       b - boot chosen device
your choice: 

Choose 'c' to select CompactFlash and then, at the main menu, choose
'x' to save the setting.  The board will reset, and immediately
attempt to boot from CompactFlash, straight into the OpenBSD
installer.
