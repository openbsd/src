For the imac systems, no floppy image is available, for now it
is necessary to bootstrap the system from an existing BSD or unix system.

At this time the bootloader and kernel must initally be loaded from the
network. A method to boot from cd is not yet available.

To load the network bootloader and install kernel from the openfirmware
prompt type "boot enet:,ofwboot /bsd.rd"

This assumes that that a machine is configured with bootp/tftp/nfs to
make the kernel and bootloader available.
