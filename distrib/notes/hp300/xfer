Installation is supported from several media types, including:
	Tape
	CD-ROM
	NFS
	FTP

The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets
for installation depend on which method of installation
you choose.  The various methods are explained below.

To prepare for installing via a tape:

	If you wish to load SYS_INST from tape, it must
	appear on the tape before any other files.  To copy
	this onto tape, use a command like the following:

		dd if=SYS_INST of=<tape_device> bs=20b

	Note that not all HP BOOTROMs support booting from
	SCSI tapes.

	Copying the miniroot to disk from tape is not currently
	supported.  However, it is planned for a future release.

	If you wish to extract binary sets onto your disk from
	tape, you must first place them on the tape.  The easiest
	way to do this is with the dd(1) command.  Make sure you
	use a `no-rewind-on-close' tape device.  For example:

		for file in base11.tar.gz etc11.tar.gz; do
			dd if=${file} of=/dev/nrst0 bs=20b
		done

	Note that depending on your tape drive, you may need to
	explicitly set the EOF marker at the end of each file.
	It may also be necessary to use the `conv=osync' argument
	to dd(1).  Note that this argument is incompatible with the
	`bs=' argument.  Consult the tape-related manual pages on the
	system where the tapes are created for more details.

To prepare for installing via NFS:

	SYS_INST currently requires an NFS server from which to
	copy the miniroot.

		* This filesystem must be exported with root permissions,
		  but may be exported read-only.

		* The miniroot image _must_ reside in the `root' of the
		  mounted filesystem.  For example, if the client system
		  mounts `server:/u', then the miniroot image must reside
		  in /u on the server.  This is due to limitations in the
		  file lookup code used in SYS_INST, and may be fixed in
		  a future release.

		* If you also wish to install the binary sets from the
		  NFS server, place them in a properly exported filesystem
		  on the server.  Note that these files do not suffer from
		  the same placement restrictions as the miniroot.

To prepare for installing via FTP:

	It is possible, using the `install' and `upgrade'
	programs in the miniroot, to extract the binary sets
	directly onto disk from an FTP server.  This is by far
	the easiest installation method, as you may specify to
	have all sets extracted at once, providing that they
	are located in the same directory on the server.

	All that is required in this case is that you have
	network access to an FTP server.  This may be your
	account on another system, or may even be ftp.NetBSD.ORG
	itself.  If you wish to use ftp.NetBSD.ORG as your FTP
	file server, you may want to keep the following information
	handy:

		IP Address: 205.149.163.23
		Login: anonymous
		Password: <your e-mail address>
		Server path: /pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.1/hp300/binary
