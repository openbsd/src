The ramdisk kernel may be loaded from the network, from CD-ROM, or other
SCSI devices (such as Zip(tm) disk).  Note that loading from HP-IB or SCSI
cartridge tape is possible, but not currently supported.


Booting from CD-ROM installation media:

You can burn a bootable CD-ROM and boot from it.
To boot from SCSI CD-ROM, simply insert the CD into the drive before power
up, then during the computer's self-test cycle, press the space bar.
Shortly, you should see a menu of possible boot options appear. Select the
option corresponding to SYS_CDBOOT. SYS_CDBOOT will then load and begin
loading bsd.rd from the CD-ROM; depending on your ROM revision and hardware
configuration, you may or may not see any messages on the console while this
happens.

Please note that booting from CD-ROM may not be supported by all models of
MACHINE.  You will also need a CD-ROM drive which uses 512-byte blocks;
anything which shipped with an MACHINE or is known to boot a SPARC or black
NeXTStation should work.  Modern CD-ROM drives jumpered to use 512-byte
blocks should work as well.


Booting from Network:

If you wish to load the SYS_UBOOT program via the network, you need to
either have another OpenBSD system on the network, or something else
capable of running the rbootd(8) program.  Source code may be found
under usr.sbin/rbootd in the OpenBSD source tree, but requires the
Berkeley Packet Filter (bpf) in order to function.  It may be possible to
use HP-UX, but it is not recommended (or documented here).  For more
information on diskless booting under OpenBSD, see the diskless(8)
manual page.

First of all, configure your rbootd to handle boot requests from the
client.  NOTE: OpenBSD's `rbootd' is slightly different from HP-UX's.
To configure OpenBSD's `rbootd', create a file called `/etc/rbootd.conf'
and place in it an entry like the following:

	08:00:09:04:AA:33	SYS_UBOOT	# thunder-egg

The first column is the Ethernet address of the client's network interface.
The second column is the program to send to the client, and anything after
the `#' is a comment.  Once you have rbootd running, copy the SYS_UBOOT
program to the /usr/mdec/rbootd directory on your server.  If this
directory doesn't exist already, you will need to create it.

Next, add the client to /etc/ethers on your server.  For example:

	08:00:09:04:AA:33	thunder-egg

Then start `rarpd' on your server; `rarpd -a' should do the trick.

Finally, you need to add an entry in /etc/bootparams.  For example:

	thunder-egg	root=myserver:/export/MACHINE

Where myserver is the name of your server machine and `/export/MACHINE'
is the directory that holds the ramdisk kernel image (`bsd.rd').
Now run `rpc.bootparamd' and make sure that this directory is NFS
exported to the client.  See the manual pages on your server system
if you need more information about exporting filesystems.  If you
run into problems you may wish to run `rpc.bootparamd' with the `-d'
flag on your server to get extra debugging information.

You are now ready to load SYS_UBOOT.  During the client's self-test cycle,
press the space bar.  Shortly after, you should see a menu of possible boot
options appear.  Select the option corresponding to SYS_UBOOT.
SYS_UBOOT will then load and prompt you for a kernel name.  NFS file
names should not have a leading '/' prepended to them; simply use `bsd.rd'.


Installing using the CD-ROM or netboot procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	When presented with the boot prompt, enter the path of your kernel
	(which is likely to be `bsd.rd').

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially from a slow
	speed CD-ROM or slow network connection, most likely more than
	a minute.  If some action doesn't eventually happen, or the
	spinning cursor has stopped and nothing further has happened,
	either your boot media is bad, your diskless setup is incorrect,
	or you may have a hardware or configuration problem.

OpenBSDInstallPart5

	Since the target disk will become the boot disk for your new
	OpenBSD/MACHINE installation, the disklabel program will restrict
	the available disk area to keep the first cylinder, which will
	contain the bootblock, safe from being overwritten. If you don't
	plan to install a bootblock on this disk, you can reclaim this
	space with the 'b' command.
