Booting the installation media:

There are two ways to load an OpenBSD/MACHINE kernel (or ramdisk),
over TFTP or from the internal CompactFlash storage.

For TFTP you will first need to setup a TFTP server as described in
diskless(8). Assuming tftpd(8) chroots into /tftpboot, copy bsd.rd into that
directory.

Power on your OpenBSD/MACHINE device and from the U-Boot prompt set up
networking. In this example it is assumed you have a DHCP server in your
network:

	# dhcp

If you don't have a DHCP server, you need to set the ipaddr U-Boot environment
variable:

	# setenv ipaddr <static ip address>

Now set the IP address of your TFTP server:

	# setenv serverip <server ip>

The ramdisk kernel needs to be loaded into memory. If you use "0" as the
address, the default address location will be used by U-Boot:

	# tftpboot 0 bsd.rd
	Using octeth0 device
	TFTP from server 192.168.178.30; our IP address is 192.168.178.89
	Filename 'bsd.rd'.
	Load address: 0x9f00000
	Loading: #########################
	done
	Bytes transferred = 7191474 (6dbbb2 hex), 8617 Kbytes/sec

Now the kernel can be booted from the default memory location, with no
arguments provided:

	# bootoctlinux

OpenBSD/MACHINE currently lacks a real bootloader. It is possible however to
boot into bsd upon powering on the machine.

From the U-Boot commandline, make a copy of the current ${bootcmd} so you can
restore it later if needed:

	# setenv old_bootcmd ${bootcmd}

${bootcmd} is run by U-Boot when ${autoload} is enabled. Now create a new
${bootcmd} which will load an ELF file called 'bsd' from the first active FAT
partition on the first CF card (created by the installer) and save the
environment to persistent storage:

	# setenv bootcmd 'fatload ide 0:1 ${loadaddr} bsd;bootoctlinux rootdev=/dev/octcf0'
	# setenv bootdelay 5
	# saveenv
	Saving Environment to Flash...
	Un-Protected 1 sectors
	Erasing Flash...
	. done
	Erased 1 sectors
	Writing to Flash... .done
	Protected 1 sectors
	#

Depending on your hardware you may need to replace 'ide' with 'usb'.

No miniroot is provided at this time.

	The fdisk(8) utility will be invoked to let you edit your MBR
	partitioning.  The current MBR partitions defined will be
	displayed and you will be allowed to modify them, and add new
	partitions.

	The setup will need two partitions, one 'OpenBSD' for the
	OpenBSD/MACHINE installation, and one 'MSDOS' for the
	U-Boot scripts/bootloader.

	If you use the whole disk option, the install script
	will create a small 'MSDOS' partition and use the rest of
	the disk for the OpenBSD installation.

	After your OpenBSD MBR partition has been setup, the real
	partition setup can follow.
