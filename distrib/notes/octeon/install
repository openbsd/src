Booting the installation media:

At the moment the only way to boot an OpenBSD/MACHINE (including the ramdisk)
kernel is over TFTP. First you need to setup an TFTP server as described in
diskless(8). Assuming tftpd(8) chroots into /tftpboot, copy bsd.rd into that
directory.

Power on your OpenBSD/MACHINE device and from the U-Boot prompt set up
networking. In this example it is assumed you have a DHCP server in your
network:

	# dhcp

If you don't have a DHCP server, you need to set the ipaddr U-Boot environment
variable:

	# setenv ipaddr <static ip address>

Now set the IP address of your TFTP server:

	# setenv serverip <server ip>

The ramdisk kernel needs to be loaded into memory. If you use "0" as the
address, the default address location will be used by U-Boot:

	# tftpboot 0 bsd.rd
	Using octeth0 device
	TFTP from server 192.168.178.30; our IP address is 192.168.178.89
	Filename 'bsd.rd'.
	Load address: 0x9f00000
	Loading: #########################
	done
	Bytes transferred = 3486088 (353188 hex), 407 Kbytes/sec

Now the kernel can be booted from the default memory location, with no
arguments provided:

	# bootoctlinux

Due to the lack of a bootloader for OpenBSD/MACHINE, this same approach
needs to be taken to boot a regular kernel after installation. Replacing
bsd.rd with bsd.

No miniroot is provided at this moment either.

	The fdisk(8) utility will be invoked to let you edit your MBR
	partitioning.  The current MBR partitions defined will be
	displayed and you will be allowed to modify them, and add new
	partitions.

dnl	The setup will need two partitions, one 'OpenBSD' for the
dnl	OpenBSD/MACHINE installation, and one 'U-Boot files' for the
dnl	U-Boot scripts/bootloader.
dnl	
dnl	If you use the whole disk option, the install script
dnl	will create a small 'U-Boot files' partition and use the rest of
dnl	the disk for the OpenBSD installation.
dnl
dnl	After your OpenBSD MBR partition has been setup, the real
dnl	partition setup can follow.
