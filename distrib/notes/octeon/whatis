OpenBSD/MACHINE is a port intended to run on systems based upon the
Cavium Octeon and Octeon PLUS MIPS64 CPUs. OpenBSD/MACHINE initially
aims to provide support for the Portwell CAM-0100 and Ubiquiti Networks
EdgeRouter LITE.

At this moment no installation sets or bootloader is available, thus the
kernel and ramdisk need to be cross-compiled (or compiled on OpenBSD/sgi).
For the installation sets the sets from OpenBSD/sgi can be used.
