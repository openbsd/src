The following machines are targeted by OpenBSD/MACHINE:

	Portwell CAM-0100
	  onboard serial port, CompactFlash and Ethernet are supported;
	  it's possible to install OpenBSD/MACHINE on this machine with
	  some effort.

	Ubiquiti Networks EdgeRouter Lite
	  at the moment little hardware is supported is supported by
	  OpenBSD/MACHINE on this machine. There is no USB support yet,
	  which means that there is no storage (no onboard CompactFlash),
	  and Ethernet isn't supported either.

Currently no USB devices are supported on OpenBSD/MACHINE.
