To be able to boot the OpenBSD/MACHINE installation program, you will
need to prepare the CF or harddrive in another machine.  Note this will
destroy any previous hard disk content.

Use the dd(1) utility to copy the file to the hard drive.
The command would likely be:
	dd if=miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rwd1c
