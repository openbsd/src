	If you have copied the miniroot image to the disk, it will
	boot automatically upon power-up.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  You should just
	hit return to select the default (vt220).

	Next you will have to edit or create a disk label for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  You will first be given an
	opportunity to run fdisk and create an OpenBSD partition.

	Fdisk will start by displaying the current partitions defined
	and then allow you to modify this information, add new partitions
	and change which partition to boot from by default.  If you make
	a mistake, you will be allowed to repeat this procedure as
	necessary to correct this.  Note that you should make OpenBSD be
	the active partition at least until the install has been completed.
