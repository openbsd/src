Although this has be done manually, upon each reboot.

After the SD card and USB hub have been setup, reset the device, wait
until it's finished booting.

card with bootloader and kernel, run 'Cocoboot' and hit the 'Boot'
button.

        Please keep in mind that upon resetting the device the clock will
        be reset too. Even if you correctly set the time in PalmOS,
        OpenBSD will not pick this up. So it is strongly advised to use
        ntpd(1).
