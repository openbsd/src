Although this has be done manually, upon each reboot.

After the SD card and USB hub have been setup, reset the device, wait
untill it's finished booting.

Hit the reset button on the device, wait till it reboots, pop in the SD
card with bootloader and kernel, run 'Cocoboot' and hit the 'Boot'
button.

        Please keep in mind that upon reseting the device the clock will
        be resetted too. Even if you correctly set the time in PalmOS,
        OpenBSD will not pick this up. So it is strongly advised to use
        ntpd(1).
