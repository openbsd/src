To be able to boot the OpenBSD/MACHINE installation program, you will
need to acquire some limited knowledge of ABLE Firmware, the low-level
process that controls the microprocessor after hardware initialization
and diagnostics are performed but before control is handed to the
operating system.

Important ABLE Firmware command examples:

boot (hd0)bsd
	boot the ELF file 'bsd' from the disk partition idenfied
	by firmware as hd0.


XXX autoboot 

XXX arguments to kernel

XXX bootable partitions
