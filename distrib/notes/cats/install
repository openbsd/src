There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk.  The easiest way
is to burn bsd.rd on a CD-ROM, and boot off it. However, the ABLE firmware
is versatile and will boot from a variety of devices and filesystems.

Booting from CD-ROM installation media:

At the ABLE firmware prompt, enter :
    > (cd0)bsd.rd
to boot from the first detected CD-ROM drive. If the CD-ROM drive has not
been detected, be sure to put a disk in the tray, and reset the machine.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  You should just
	hit return to select the default (vt220).

	Next you will have to edit or create a disk label for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  If there are any existing
	partitions defined (for any operating system), and a disk label
	is not found, you will first be given an opportunity to run
	fdisk and create an OpenBSD partition.

	If fdisk is being invoked on your behalf, it will start by
	displaying the current partitions defined and then allow you
	to modify this information, add new partitions and change
	which partition to boot from by default.  If you make a mistake,
	you will be allowed to repeat this procedure as necessary to
	correct this.  Note that you should make OpenBSD be the active
	partition at least until the install has been completed.

OpenBSDInstallPart4({:- If you have Linux partitions
	defined on the disk, these will usually show up as partition
	'h', 'i' and so on.-:})

	Note that all OpenBSD partitions in the disk label must have an
	offset that makes it start within the OpenBSD part of the disk,
	and a size that keeps it inside of that portion of the disk.  This
	is within the bounds of the 'c' partition if the disk is not being
	shared with other operating systems, and within the OpenBSD fdisk
	partition if the disk is being shared.
