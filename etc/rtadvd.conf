# common definitions.
# Note: All of the following parameters have default values defined
#       in specifications, and hence you usually do not have to set them
#       by hand unless you need special non-default values.
#       You even do not need to create the configuration file. rtadvd
#       would usually work well without a configuration file.
#       See also: rtadvd(8)

# per-interface definitions.
#   IPv6 prefixes are configured in this part. However, rtadvd
#   automatically learns appropriate prefixes from the kernel's routing
#   table and advertises the prefixes, so you don't have to configure
#   this part, either.
#   If you don't want the automatic advertisement, invoke rtadvd with
#   the -s option and configure this part by hand.
