# First between the networks 10.1.1.0/24 and 10.1.2.0/24,
# second between the machines 192.168.3.1 and 192.168.3.2.
# Use FQDNs as IDs.

# The first rules sets up the flow, second the SA.  As default
# transforms ipsecctl(8) will use hmac-sha2-256 for authentication
# and aesctr for encryption.  hmac-sha2-256 uses a 256 bit key, aesctr
# a 160 bit key.
