NetBSD/Sun3 Binary Snapshot

This FTP directory contains a binary snapshot of NetBSD/Sun3.

The NetBSD/sun3 port runs on most Sun3 machines, including:

	Sun3/{50,60,110,160,260}

Devices currently supported include:

	Intel Ether (ie), on-board or VME
	Lance Ether (le), on-board
	SCSI (sd,st,...), on-board or VME
	keyboard/display console
	serial port (ttya/ttyb) console

Other Features:

	Generic kernel supports root on: sd[0123], ie0, le0
	Kernel debugger included (ddb)
	Runs SunOS binaries (see sparc sun shared lib notes)

There's still a lot left to do  (see doc/sun3/TODO).

Before using the files in this directory, you should start by
unpacking doc.shar and reading all the files it contains.
Suggested reading order is:
	doc/sun3/README
	doc/sun3/STATUS
	doc/sun3/INSTALL
	doc/sun3/SUP
	doc/sun3/BUILDING
	doc/sun3/TODO

To use this, all you need to do it unpack everything onto the
disk that will be used for root and usr, which can be either a
real disk or some part of your NFS server.

REMEMBER: run dev/MAKEDEV after you unpack things!
(cd dev ; MAKEDEV std)

If you have any questions or comments about this port please
send mail to the list:  <port-sun3@netbsd.org>

If you'd like to help, send me mail at <gwr@netbsd.org>
so I can coordinate efforts.

Enjoy!
