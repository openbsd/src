.Sh DESCRIPTION
For more details on
.Nm KeyNote ,
see RFC 2704.
.Pp
KeyNote assertions are divided into sections, called `fields', that
serve various semantic functions. Each field starts with an
identifying label at the beginning of a line, followed by the ":"
character and the field's contents. There can be at most one field per
line.
.Pp
A field may be continued over more than one line by indenting
subsequent lines with at least one ASCII SPACE or TAB character.
Whitespace (a SPACE, TAB, or NEWLINE character) separates tokens but
is otherwise ignored outside of quoted strings. Comments with a
leading octothorp character ('#') may begin in any column.
.Pp
One mandatory field is required in all assertions: Authorizer
.Pp
Six optional fields may also appear: Comment, Conditions,
KeyNote-Version, Licensees, Local-Constants, Signature.
.Pp
All field names are case-insensitive. The "KeyNote-Version" field, if
present, appears first. The "Signature" field, if present, appears
last. Otherwise, fields may appear in any order. Each field may appear
at most once in any assertion.
.Pp
Blank lines are not permitted in assertions. Multiple assertions
stored in a file (e.g., in application policy configurations),
therefore, can be separated from one another unambiguously by the use
of blank lines between them.
.Pp
.Sh COMMENTS
The octothorp character ("#", ASCII 35 decimal) can be used to
introduce comments. Outside of quoted strings, all characters from the
"#" character through the end of the current line are ignored.
However, commented text is included in the computation of assertion
signatures.
.Pp
.Sh STRINGS
A `string' is a lexical object containing a sequence of characters.
Strings may contain any non-NUL characters, including newlines and
nonprintable characters. Strings may be given as literals, computed
from complex expressions, or dereferenced from attribute names.
.Sh STRING LITERALS
A string literal directly represents the value of a string. String
literals must be quoted by preceding and following them with the
double-quote character (ASCII 34 decimal).
.Pp
A printable character may be `escaped' inside a quoted string literal
by preceding it with the backslash character (ASCII 92 decimal) (e.g.,
"like \\"this\\"."). This permits the inclusion of the double- quote and
backslash characters inside string literals.
.Pp
A similar escape mechanism is also used to represent non-printable
characters. "\\n" represents the newline character (ASCII character 10
decimal), "\\r" represents the carriage-return character (ASCII
character 13 decimal), "\\t" represents the tab character (ASCII
character 9 decimal), and "\\f" represents the form-feed character
(ASCII character 12 decimal). A backslash character followed by a
newline suppresses all subsequent whitespace (including the newline)
up to the next non-whitespace character (this allows the continuation
of long string constants across lines). Un-escaped newline and return
characters are illegal inside string literals.
.Pp
The constructs "\\0o", "\\0oo", and "\\ooo" (where o represents any
octal digit) may be used to represent any non-NUL ASCII characters
with their corresponding octal values (thus, "\\012" is the same as
"\\n", "\\101" is "A", and "\\377" is the ASCII character 255 decimal).
However, the NUL character cannot be encoded in this manner; "\\0",
"\\00", and "\\000" are converted to the strings "0", "00", and "000"
respectively.  Similarly, all other escaped characters have the
leading backslash removed (e.g., "\\a" becomes "a", and "\\\\" becomes
"\\").  The following four strings are equivalent:
.Bd -literal
        "this string contains a newline\\n followed by one space."
        "this string contains a newline\\n \\
        followed by one space."
        "this str\\
           ing contains a \\
             newline\\n followed by one space."
        "this string contains a newline\\012\\040followed by one space."
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh STRING EXPRESSIONS
In general, anywhere a quoted string literal is allowed, a `string
expression' can be used. A string expression constructs a string from
string constants, dereferenced attributes (described below), and a
string concatenation operator. String expressions may be
parenthesized.

.Bd -literal
       <StrEx>:: <StrEx> "." <StrEx>    /* String concatenation */
               | <StringLiteral>        /* Quoted string */
               | "(" <StrEx> ")"
               | <DerefAttribute>
               | "$" <StrEx> ;
.Ed

The "$" operator has higher precedence than the "." operator.
.Pp
.Sh DEREFERENCED ATTRIBUTES
Action attributes provide the primary mechanism for applications to
pass information to assertions. Attribute names are strings from a
limited character set (see below), and attribute values are
represented internally as strings. An attribute is dereferenced simply
by using its name. In general, KeyNote allows the use of an attribute
anywhere a string literal is permitted.
.Pp
Attributes are dereferenced as strings by default. When required,
dereferenced attributes can be converted to integers or floating point
numbers with the type conversion operators "@" and "&". Thus, an
attribute named "foo" having the value "1.2" may be interpreted as the
string "1.2" (foo), the integer value 1 (@foo), or the floating point
value 1.2 (&foo).
.Pp
Attributes converted to integer and floating point numbers are
represented according to the ANSI C `long' and `float' types,
respectively. In particular, integers range from -2147483648 to
2147483647, whilst floats range from 1.17549435E-38F to
3.40282347E+38F.
.Pp
Any uninitialized attribute has the empty-string value when
dereferenced as a string and the value zero when dereferenced as an
integer or float.
.Pp
Attribute names may be given literally or calculated from string
expressions and may be recursively dereferenced. In the simplest case,
an attribute is dereferenced simply by using its name outside of
quotes; e.g., the string value of the attribute named "foo" is by
reference to `foo' (outside of quotes). The "$<StrEx>" construct
dereferences the attribute named in the string expression <StrEx>. For
example, if the attribute named "foo" contains the string "bar", the
attribute named "bar" contains the string "xyz", and the attribute
"xyz" contains the string "qua", the following string comparisons are
all true:

.Bd -literal
    foo == "bar"
    $("foo") == "bar"
    $foo == "xyz"
    $(foo) == "xyz"
    $$foo == "qua"
.Ed

If <StrEx> evaluates to an invalid or uninitialized attribute name,
its value is considered to be the empty string (or zero if used as a
numeric).
.Pp
The <DerefAttribute> token is defined as:
.Bd -literal
      <DerefAttribute>:: <AttributeID> ;
       <AttributeID>:: {Any string starting with a-z, A-Z, or the
                        underscore character, followed by any number of
                        a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or underscore characters} ;
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh PRINCIPAL IDENTIFIERS
Principals are represented as ASCII strings called `Principal
Identifiers'. Principal Identifiers may be arbitrary labels whose
structure is not interpreted by the KeyNote system or they may encode
cryptographic keys that are used by KeyNote for credential signature
verification.

.Bd -literal
       <PrincipalIdentifier>:: <OpaqueID>
                             | <KeyID> ;
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh OPAQUE PRINCIPAL IDENTIFIERS
Principal Identifiers that are used by KeyNote only as labels are
said to be `opaque'.  Opaque identifiers are encoded in assertions as
strings (as defined above):

.Bd -literal
       <OpaqueID>:: <StrEx> ;
.Ed

Opaque identifier strings should not contain the ":" character.
.Pp
.Sh CRYPTOGRAPHIC PRINCIPAL IDENTIFIERS
Principal Identifiers that are used by KeyNote as keys, e.g., to
verify credential signatures, are said to be `cryptographic'.
Cryptographic identifiers are also lexically encoded as strings:

.Bd -literal
       <KeyID>:: <StrEx> ;
.Ed

Unlike Opaque Identifiers, however, Cryptographic Identifier strings
have a special form. To be interpreted by KeyNote (for signature
verification), an identifier string should be of the form:

.Bd -literal
      <IDString>:: <ALGORITHM>":"<ENCODEDBITS> ;
.Ed

"ALGORITHM" is an ASCII substring that describes the algorithms to be
used in interpreting the key's bits. The ALGORITHM identifies the
major cryptographic algorithm (e.g., RSA [RSA78], DSA [DSA94], etc.),
structured format (e.g., PKCS1 [PKCS1]), and key bit encoding (e.g.,
HEX or BASE64). By convention, the ALGORITHM substring starts with an
alphabetic character and can contain letters, digits, underscores, or
dashes (i.e., it should match the regular expression "[a-zA-Z][a-
zA-Z0-9_-]*"). The IANA (or some other appropriate authority) will
provide a registry of reserved algorithm identifiers.
.Pp
"ENCODEDBITS" is a substring of characters representing the key's
bits, the encoding and format of which depends on the ALGORITHM. By
convention, hexadecimal encoded keys use lower-case ASCII characters.
.Pp
Cryptographic Principal Identifiers are converted to a normalized
canonical form for the purposes of any internal comparisons between
them; see RFC 2704 for more details.
.Pp
.Sh KEYNOTE-VERSION FIELD
The KeyNote-Version field identifies the version of the KeyNote
assertion language under which the assertion was written. The
KeyNote-Version field is of the form:

.Bd -literal
       <VersionField>:: "KeyNote-Version:" <VersionString> ;
       <VersionString>:: <StringLiteral>
                       | <IntegerLiteral> ;
.Ed

<VersionString> is an ASCII-encoded string. Assertions in production
versions of KeyNote use decimal digits in the version representing the
version number of the KeyNote language under which they are to be
interpreted. Assertions written to conform with this document should
be identified with the version string "2" (or the integer 2). The
KeyNote-Version field, if included, should appear first.
.Pp
.Sh LOCAL-CONSTANTS FIELD
This field adds or overrides action attributes in the current
assertion only.  This mechanism allows the use of short names for
(frequently lengthy) cryptographic principal identifiers, especially
to make the Licensees field more readable.  The Local-Constants field
is of the form:

.Bd -literal
       <LocalConstantsField>:: "Local-Constants:" <Assignments> ;
       <Assignments>:: /* can be empty */
                     | <AttributeID> "=" <StringLiteral> <Assignments> ;
.Ed

<AttributeID> is an attribute name from the action attribute
namespace. The name is available for use as an attribute in any
subsequent field. If the Local-Constants field defines more than one
identifier, it can occupy more than one line and be indented.
<StringLiteral> is a string literal as described previously.
Attributes defined in the Local-Constants field override any
attributes with the same name passed in with the action attribute set.
.Pp
An attribute may be initialized at most once in the Local-Constants
field. If an attribute is initialized more than once in an assertion,
the entire assertion is considered invalid and is not considered by
the KeyNote compliance checker in evaluating queries.
.Pp
.Sh AUTHORIZER FIELD
The Authorizer identifies the Principal issuing the assertion. This
field is of the form:

.Bd -literal
       <AuthField>:: "Authorizer:" <AuthID> ;
       <AuthID>:: <PrincipalIdentifier>
                | <DerefAttribute> ;
.Ed

The Principal Identifier may be given directly or by reference to the
attribute namespace.
.Pp
.Sh LICENSEES FIELD
The Licensees field identifies the principals authorized by the
assertion. More than one principal can be authorized, and
authorization can be distributed across several principals through the
use of `and' and threshold constructs. This field is of the form:

.Bd -literal
       <LicenseesField>:: "Licensees:" <LicenseesExpr> ;

       <LicenseesExpr>::      /* can be empty */
                         | <PrincExpr> ;

       <PrincExpr>:: "(" <PrincExpr> ")"
                     | <PrincExpr> "&&" <PrincExpr>
                     | <PrincExpr> "||" <PrincExpr>
                     | <K>"-of(" <PrincList> ")"        /* Threshold */
                     | <PrincipalIdentifier>
                     | <DerefAttribute> ;

       <PrincList>:: <PrincipalIdentifier>
                   | <DerefAttribute>
                   | <PrincList> "," <PrincList> ;

       <K>:: {Decimal number starting with a digit from 1 to 9} ;
.Ed

The "&&" operator has higher precedence than the "||" operator. <K> is
an ASCII-encoded positive decimal integer. If a <PrincList> contains
fewer than <K> principals, the entire assertion is omitted from
processing.
.Pp
.Sh CONDITIONS FIELD
This field gives the `conditions' under which the Authorizer trusts
the Licensees to perform an action. `Conditions' are predicates that
operate on the action attribute set. The Conditions field is of the
form:

.Bd -literal
    <ConditionsField>:: "Conditions:" <ConditionsProgram> ;

    <ConditionsProgram>:: /* Can be empty */
                          | <Clause> ";" <ConditionsProgram> ;

    <Clause>:: <Test> "->" "{" <ConditionsProgram> "}"
             | <Test> "->" <Value>
             | <Test> ;

    <Value>:: <StrEx> ;

    <Test>:: <RelExpr> ;

    <RelExpr>:: "(" <RelExpr> ")"        /* Parentheses */
              | <RelExpr> "&&" <RelExpr> /* Logical AND */
              | <RelExpr> "||" <RelExpr> /* Logical OR */
              | "!" <RelExpr>         /* Logical NOT */
              | <IntRelExpr>
              | <FloatRelExpr>
              | <StringRelExpr>
              | "true"        /* case insensitive */
              | "false" ;     /* case insensitive */

    <IntRelExpr>:: <IntEx> "==" <IntEx>
                 | <IntEx> "!=" <IntEx>
                 | <IntEx> "<" <IntEx>
                 | <IntEx> ">" <IntEx>
                 | <IntEx> "<=" <IntEx>
                 | <IntEx> ">=" <IntEx> ;

    <FloatRelExpr>:: <FloatEx> "<" <FloatEx>
                   | <FloatEx> ">" <FloatEx>
                   | <FloatEx> "<=" <FloatEx>
                   | <FloatEx> ">=" <FloatEx> ;

    <StringRelExpr>:: <StrEx> "==" <StrEx>  /* String equality */
                    | <StrEx> "!=" <StrEx>  /* String inequality */
                    | <StrEx> "<" <StrEx>   /* Alphanum. comparisons */
                    | <StrEx> ">" <StrEx>
                    | <StrEx> "<=" <StrEx>
                    | <StrEx> ">=" <StrEx>
                    | <StrEx> "~=" <RegExpr> ; /* Reg. expr. matching */

    <IntEx>:: <IntEx> "+" <IntEx>        /* Integer */
            | <IntEx> "-" <IntEx>
            | <IntEx> "*" <IntEx>
            | <IntEx> "/" <IntEx>
            | <IntEx> "%" <IntEx>
            | <IntEx> "^" <IntEx>        /* Exponentiation */
            | "-" <IntEx>
            | "(" <IntEx> ")"
            | <IntegerLiteral>
            | "@" <StrEx> ;

    <FloatEx>:: <FloatEx> "+" <FloatEx>  /* Floating point */
              | <FloatEx> "-" <FloatEx>
              | <FloatEx> "*" <FloatEx>
              | <FloatEx> "/" <FloatEx>
              | <FloatEx> "^" <FloatEx> /* Exponentiation */
              | "-" <FloatEx>
              | "(" <FloatEx> ")"
              | <FloatLiteral>
              | "&" <StrEx> ;

    <IntegerLiteral>:: {Decimal number of at least one digit} ;
    <FloatLiteral>:: <IntegerLiteral>"."<IntegerLiteral> ;

    <StringLiteral> is a quoted string as defined in previously
    <AttributeID> is defined previously.
.Ed

The operation precedence classes are (from highest to lowest):

.Bd -literal
        { (, ) }
        {unary -, @, &, $}
        {^}
        {*, /, %}
        {+, -, .}
.Ed

Operators in the same precedence class are evaluated left-to-right.
.Pp
Note the inability to test for floating point equality, as most
floating point implementations (hardware or otherwise) do not
guarantee accurate equality testing.
.Pp
Also note that integer and floating point expressions can only be used
within clauses of condition fields, but in no other KeyNote field.
.Pp
The keywords "true" and "false" are not reserved; they can be used as
attribute or principal identifier names (although this practice makes
assertions difficult to understand and is discouraged).
.Pp
<RegExpr> is a standard regular expression, conforming to the POSIX
1003.2 regular expression syntax and semantics (see
.Xr regex 3 ).
.Pp
Any string expression (or attribute) containing the ASCII
representation of a numeric value can be converted to an integer or
float with the use of the "@" and "&" operators, respectively. Any
fractional component of an attribute value dereferenced as an integer
is rounded down. If an attribute dereferenced as a number cannot be
properly converted (e.g., it contains invalid characters or is empty)
its value is considered to be zero.
.Pp
.Sh COMMENT FIELD
The Comment field allows assertions to be annotated with information
describing their purpose. It is of the form:

.Bd -literal
       <CommentField>:: "Comment:" <text> ;
.Ed

No interpretation of the contents of this field is performed by
KeyNote. Note that this is one of two mechanisms for including
comments in KeyNote assertions; comments can also be inserted anywhere
in an assertion's body by preceding them with the "#" character
(except inside string literals).
.Pp
.Sh SIGNATURE FIELD
The Signature field identifies a signed assertion and gives the
encoded digital signature of the principal identified in the
Authorizer field. The Signature field is of the form:

.Bd -literal
       <SignatureField>:: "Signature:" <Signature> ;
       <Signature>:: <StrEx> ;
.Ed

The <Signature> string should be of the form:

.Bd -literal
       <IDString>:: <ALGORITHM>":"<ENCODEDBITS> ;
.Ed

The formats of the "ALGORITHM" and "ENCODEDBITS" substrings are as
described for Cryptographic Principal Identifiers. The algorithm name
should be the same as that of the principal appearing in the
Authorizer field. The IANA (or some other suitable authority) will
provide a registry of reserved names. It is not necessary that the
encodings of the signature and the authorizer key be the same.
.Pp
If the signature field is included, the principal named in the
Authorizer field must be a Cryptographic Principal Identifier, the
algorithm must be known to the KeyNote implementation, and the
signature must be correct for the assertion body and authorizer key.
.Pp
The signature is computed over the assertion text, beginning with the
first field (including the field identifier string), up to (but not
including) the Signature field identifier. The newline preceding the
signature field identifier is the last character included in signature
calculation. The signature is always the last field in a KeyNote
assertion. Text following this field is not considered part of the
assertion.
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
Note that the keys and signatures in these examples are fictional, and
generally much shorter than would be required for real security, in
the interest of readability.
