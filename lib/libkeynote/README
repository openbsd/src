This is release 2-beta2 of the KeyNote trust management library reference
implementation.

For details on the KeyNote spec, read the file keynote-spec, included in
this distribution (in the doc/ directory).

To build the distribution, just type "make" or "make crypt". To test the
distribution, type "make test". The query should evaluate to "true" (look
at the last few lines of output). To build without crypto support, use
"make nocrypto".

Compile tips:
- You need the SSLeay/OpenSSL library if you compile with crypto
  (default), version 0.8.1b or later. You can find it in various
  crypto software repositories, or at:
	   ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL/

  OpenSSL can be found at:
	   http://www.openssl.com/

  Edit this distribution's Makefile, changing the variables SSLINC and
  SSLLIB to reflect the location of the include files and libraries
  respectively for SSLeay/OpenSSL.

- Similarly, if you compile with -DPGPLIB you will need PGPlib-1.1
  from ftp://dslab1.cs.uit.no/pub/PGPlib-1.1.tar.gz
  ** Notice: there is no support for PGPLIB yet **

  Make sure PGPINC and PGPLIB (in Makefile) point at the right
  locations for the include files and the library respectively.

- You may need to add support for initialization of the random
  generator routines. There is currently support for most BSDs and
  Linux. Look in keynote-keygen.c and environment.c for calls to
  RAND_seed(). Bear in mind that you need high-quality
  (cryptographic-grade) randomness.

- If your system does not have snprintf(), uncomment the -DNO_SNPRINTF
  in the Makefile (NOCRYPTODEFS variable).

- If your system does not have getopt(), move the files getopt.c and
  getopt.h from Misc/ and uncomment the GETOPT line in the Makefile, and
  enable the -DNEED_GETOPT flag in NOCRYPTODEFS (you do not need to
  for Windows).

- For Windows, you should be able to compile using Visual C++ without
  too much trouble (thanks to Dave Clark for testing release 0.1). You
  can get a copy of a regular expression library from the KeyNote web
  page (see below).

The Makefile creates the libkeynote.a library and the keynote program.
*** Notice that the 4 programs of previous releases have been folded into one

There is a man page for the library calls (keynote.3) and one for the command
line tool (keynote.1), in the man/ directory. There is also a man page
about KeyNote itself (keynote.4), which contains some text from the spec.

To view them, use:

  nroff -mandoc keynote.1 | more
  nroff -mandoc keynote.3 | more
  nroff -mandoc keynote.4 | more

Alternatively, you can just install them in your manpath. If your
nroff does not support the -mandoc flag, use -man instead. For those
systems that do not have nroff, the text version of the man pages are
provided as well (the files with .0 suffixes in the same directory).

The "keynote verify" function can be used to verify a request, given a
set of assertions and an environment file. The directory testsuite/
has some examples assertions. The "keynote keygen" function can
be used to generate keys. The "keynote sign" and "keynote sigver" can be
used to sign assertions, and verify signed assertions respectively.

The file base64.c was taken from the OpenBSD libc and was slightly
modified.

Read the TODO file to see what's missing (and eventually coming).

When in doubt on how to use a library call (despite the man pages),
consult the implementation of the various utilities.
