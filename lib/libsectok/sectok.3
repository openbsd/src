.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm sectok
provides initialization, input, output, and other basic routines for ISO
7816 smart cards.
Many of the routines return a status word.
This will either be an error code as given in the include file,
or an SW1/SW2 pair as specified in ISO 7816.
.Pp
.Fn sectok_open
opens a connection to a smart card via serial port number
.Fa rn .
Ports are
numbered from 0, which corresponds to /dev/tty00 on UNIX.
If there is no card in the reader,
.Fn sectok_open
will either wait for card insertion, or if flag
.Dv STONOWAIT
is given, it will return immediately with error
.Dv STENOCARD .
.Fa swp
points to a status word that will be set on return.
.Pp
.Fn sectok_friendly_open
opens a connection to a smart card via a reader device name
.Fa rn .
Mapping from reader name to serial port number is the same as used in
.Fn sectok_open .
For other arguments and return values, see
.Fn sectok_open .
.Pp
.Fn sectok_reset
resets the card and returns the ATR in the buffer pointed to by
.Fa atr
if it is not
.Dv NULL .
If the
.Dv STRFORCE
flag is given, a connection to the card will be established
using default protocol parameters even if the card ATR is illegal.
.Pp
.Fn sectok_apdu
sends an APDU to the card with optional IN and OUT data.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fa cla
application class
.It Fa ins
instruction code
.It Fa p1 , Fa p2
per ISO 7816-3 or application dependent
.It Fa ilen
length of IN data
.It Fa ibuf
pointer to IN data
.It Fa olen
length of OUT data
.It Fa obuf
pointer to OUT data
.It Fa swp
pointer to return status word
.El
.Pp
.Fn sectok_cardpresent
returns whether a card is present in the reader.
.Pp
.Fn sectok_close
closes a connection to a smart card.
.Pp
.Fn sectok_selectfile
selects a file given its FID by sending a "select" apdu to the card.
.Pp
.Fn sectok_fmt_fid
returns a printable name for a FID.
.Pp
.Fn sectok_parse_atr
parses a card ATR and returns the protocol parameters.
If the
.Dv STRV
flag is given it will print the parameters to standard out.
.Pp
.Fn sectok_parse_fname
translates a printable name to a FID.
.Pp
.Fn sectok_print_sw
looks up the error message string affiliated with a status word
and writes it to standard out.
.Pp
.Fn sectok_swOK
returns 1 if
.Dv sw
indicates success, or 0 if it indicates failure.
