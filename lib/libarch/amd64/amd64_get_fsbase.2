.Dt AMD64_GET_FSBASE 2 amd64
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm amd64_get_fsbase ,
.Nm amd64_set_fsbase
.Nd manage amd64 per-thread %fs base address
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <machine/sysarch.h>
.Ft int
.Fn amd64_get_fsbase "void **base"
.Ft int
.Fn amd64_set_fsbase "void *base"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn amd64_get_fsbase
copies the current base address of the %fs segment into the memory
referenced by
.Fa base .
.Pp
.Fn amd64_set_fsbase
sets the base address of the %fs segment to the address
.Fa base .
.Pp
When rfork(RFPROC | RFTHREAD) is used, the segment base address
for the above calls is a per-thread value.
When a new thread is created,
it inherits the base from the thread that created it.
.Pp
.Sy Note:
Code using the
.Fn amd64_get_fsbase
and
.Fn amd64_set_fsbase
functions must be compiled using
.Cm -lamd64 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn amd64_get_fsbase
and
.Fn amd64_set_fsbase
return 0.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn amd64_get_fsbase
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width [EINVAL]
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa base
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.El
.Sh WARNING
The ELF Thread-Local Storage ABI reserves %fs for its own use and
requires that the dynamic linker and thread library set it to
reference data-structures internal to and shared between them.
Programs should use the __thread storage class keyword instead of
using these calls.
To be maximally portable,
programs that require per-thread data should use the
.Fn pthread_key_create
interface.
