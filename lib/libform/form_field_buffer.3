.SH NAME
\fBform_field_buffer\fR - field buffer control
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
int set_field_buffer(FIELD *field, int buf, const char *value);
.br
char *field_buffer(const FIELD *field, int buffer);
.br
int set_field_status(FIELD *field, bool status);
.br
bool field_status(const FIELD *field);
.br
int set_max_field(FIELD *field, int max);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_field_buffer\fR sets the numbered buffer of the given field
to contain a given string.  Buffer 0 is the displayed value of the field; other
numbered buffers may be allocated by applications through the \fBnbuf\fR
argument of (see \fBform_field_new\fR(3)) but are not manipulated by the forms
library.  The function \fBfield_buffer\fR returns the foreground attribute.

The function \fBset_field_status\fR sets the associated status flag of
\fIfield\fR; \fBfield_status\fR gets the current value.  The status flag
is set to a nonzero value whenever the field changes.

The function \fBset_max_field\fR sets the maximum size for a dynamic field.
An argument of 0 turns off any maximum size threshold for that field.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The \fBfield_buffer\fR function returns NULL on error.

The \fBfield_status\fR function returns \fBTRUE\fR or \fBFALSE\fR.

The remaining routines return one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
\fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fR
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3) and 3 pages whose names begin with "form_" for detailed
descriptions of the entry points.
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
