.Nd check for password expiration
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <stdio.h>
.Fd #include <util.h>
.Ft int
.Fn login_check_expire "FILE *back" "struct passwd *pwd" "char *class" "int lastchance"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn login_check_expire
function is called by a BSD authentication login script to
check whether the user's password entry, as described by
.Fa pwd ,
has expired.
.Pp
If a
.Fa class
is specified, it is used instead of the class specified in the user's
password database entry.
If the
.Fa lastchance
argument is non-zero, the user's password has expired, and it has not been
expired longer than
.Dq password-dead
seconds (see
.Xr login.conf 5 ) ,
the user will be able to log in one last time to change the password.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
The
.Fn login_check_expire
function returns 0 if the user's password has not expired, and 1 if it has
expired or if an error occurred.
.br
Status and error messages are passed
back to the login script caller via the back channel,
.Fa back .
