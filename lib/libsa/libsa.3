.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library allows user processes to access
.Xr audio 4
hardware and the
.Xr aucat 1
audio server in a uniform way.
It supports full-duplex operation, and when
used with the
.Xr aucat 1
server it supports resampling and format
conversions on the fly.
.Ss Opening and closing an audio stream
First the application must call the
.Fn sa_open
routine to obtain a handle representing the newly created stream;
later it will be passed as the
.Ar hdl
argument of most other functions.
The
.Fn sa_open
routine first tries to connect to the
.Xr aucat 1
audio server.
If that fails, it then tries to use the
.Xr audio 4
hardware device.
The
.Ar name
parameter gives the path of the
.Xr aucat 1
socket or the
.Xr audio 4
device.
In most cases it should be left to NULL to allow
the user to select it using the
.Ev AUDIODEVICE
environment variable.
.Pp
The
.Ar mode
parameter gives the direction of the stream.
The following are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "SA_PLAY | SA_REC"
.It SA_PLAY
The stream is play-only; data written to the stream will be played
by the hardware.
.It SA_REC
The stream is record-only; recorded samples by the hardware
must be read from the stream.
.It SA_PLAY | SA_REC
The stream plays and records synchronously; this means that
the n-th recorded sample was physically sampled exactly when
the n-th played sample was actually played.
.El
.Pp
If the
.Ar nbio_flag
argument is true (i.e. non-zero), then the
.Fn sa_read
and
.Fn sa_write
routines (see below) will be non-blocking.
.Pp
The
.Fn sa_close
routine closes the stream and frees all allocated resources
associated with the
.Nm
handle.
.Ss Negotiating audio parameters
Audio streams always use linear interleaved encoding.
The set of parameters of the stream that can be controlled
is given by the following structure:
.Bd -literal -offset -indent
struct sa_par {
	unsigned bits;	/* bits per sample */
	unsigned bps;	/* bytes per sample */
	unsigned sig;	/* 1 = signed, 0 = unsigned */
	unsigned le;	/* 1 = LE, 0 = BE byte order */
	unsigned msb;	/* 1 = MSB, 0 = LSB aligned */
	unsigned rchan;	/* number channels for recording */
	unsigned pchan;	/* number channels for playback */
	unsigned rate;	/* frames per second */
	unsigned bufsz;	/* frames in the stream buffer */
	unsigned round;	/* optimal buffer size divisor */
#define SA_IGNORE	0	/* pause during xrun */
#define SA_SYNC		1	/* resync after xrun */
#define SA_ERROR	2	/* terminate on xrun */
	unsigned xrun;	/* what to do on overrun/underrun */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The parameters are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "round"
.It Va bits
Number of bits per sample: must be between 1 and 32.
.It Va bps
Bytes per samples; if specified, it must be large enough to hold all bits.
By default it's set to the smallest power of two large enough to hold
.Va bits .
.It Va sig
If set (i.e. non-zero) then the samples are signed, else unsigned.
.It Va le
If set, then the byte order is little endian, else big endian;
it's meaningful only if
.Va bps \*(Gt 1 .
.It Va msb
If set, then the
.Va bits
bits are aligned in the packet to the most significant bit
(i.e. lower bits are padded),
else to the least significant bit
(i.e. higher bits are padded);
it's meaningful only if
.Va bits \*(Lt bps * 8 .
.It Va rchan
The number of recorded channels; meaningful only if
.Va SA_REC
mode was selected.
.It Va pchan
The number of played channels; meaningful only if
.Va SA_PLAY
mode was selected.
.It Va rate
The sampling frequency in Hz.
.It Va bufsz
The number of frames that will be buffered for both
play and record directions.
.It Va round
Optimal number of frames that the application buffers
should be a multiple of, to get best performance;
it is read-only.
.It Va xrun
The action when the client doesn't accept
recorded data or doesn't provide data to play fast enough;
it can be set to one of the
.Va SA_IGNORE ,
.Va SA_SYNC
or
.Va SA_ERROR
constants.
.El
.Pp
There are two approaches to negotiate parameters of the stream:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Advanced applications may use native parameters of
the audio subsystem.
This is the best approach from a performance point of view
since it involves no extra format conversions.
The
.Fn sa_getcap ,
described below,
can be used to get the list of native parameter sets and then
.Fn sa_initpar
and
.Fn sa_setpar
can be used to select a working set.
.It
Simpler applications that do not have performance constraints may set up
the audio subsystem to use their own parameters.
The
.Va sa_par
structure must be initialized using the
.Fn sa_initpar
routine, filled with the desired parameters and
the
.Fn sa_setpar
routine must be called.
Finally, the
.Fn sa_getpar
routine can be used to ensure that parameters were actually
accepted.
.El
.Pp
If
.Nm
is used to connect to the
.Xr aucat 1
server, a transparent emulation layer will
automatically be set up, and in this case any
parameters are supported.
.Pp
To ease filling the
.Va sa_par
structure, the
following macros can be used:
.Bl -tag -width "SA_BPS(bits)"
.It "SA_BPS(bits)"
Return the smallest value for
.Va bps
that is a power of two and that is large enough to
hold
.Va bits .
.It "SA_LE_NATIVE"
Can be used to set the
.Va le
parameter when native byte order is required.
.El
.Pp
Note that (once initialized with the
.Fn sa_initpar
routine), not all fields of the
.Va sa_par
structure must be filled; it is recommended to fill only
the required parameters, as other ones will default to
reasonable values.
This approach also ensures that if, in the future, newer parameters
are added, then older unaware applications will continue to
behave correctly.
.Ss Getting stream capabilities
Advanced applications can fetch the native
parameters of the audio subsystem and then choose parameters
optimal for both the application and the audio subsystem.
In this case applications must be able to do
the necessary format conversions.
The
.Va sa_cap
structure, filled by the
.Fn sa_getcap
routine, contains the list of parameter configurations.
Each configuration contains multiple parameter sets.
The application must examine all configurations, and
choose its parameter set from
.Em one
of the configurations.
Parameters of different configurations
.Em are not
usable together.
.Bd -literal
struct sa_cap {
	struct sa_enc {			/* allowed encodings */
		unsigned bits;
		unsigned bps;
		unsigned sig;
		unsigned le;
		unsigned msb;
	} enc[SA_NENC];
	unsigned rchan[SA_NCHAN];	/* allowed rchans */
	unsigned pchan[SA_NCHAN];	/* allowed pchans */
	unsigned rate[SA_NRATE];	/* allowed rates */
	unsigned nconf;			/* num. of confs[] */
	struct sa_conf {
		unsigned enc;		/* bitmask of enc[] indexes */
		unsigned rchan;		/* bitmask of rchan[] indexes */
		unsigned pchan;		/* bitmask of pchan[] indexes */
		unsigned rate;		/* bitmask of rate[] indexes */
	} confs[SA_NCONF];
};
.Ed
.Pp
The parameters are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "rchan[SA_NCHAN]"
.It Va enc[SA_NENC]
Array of supported encodings.
The tuple of
.Va bits ,
.Va bps ,
.Va sig ,
.Va le
and
.Va msb
parameters are usable in the corresponding parameters
of the
.Va sa_par
structure.
.It Va rchan[SA_NENC]
Array of supported channel numbers for recording usable
in the
.Va sa_par
structure.
.It Va pchan[SA_NENC]
Array of supported channel numbers for playback usable
in the
.Va sa_par
structure.
.It Va rate[SA_NRATE]
Array of supported sample rates usable
in the
.Va sa_par
structure.
.It Va nconf
Number of different configurations available, i.e. number
of filled elements of the
.Va confs[]
array.
.It Va confs[SA_NCONF]
Array of available configurations.
Each configuration contains bitmasks indicating which
elements of the above parameter arrays are valid for the
given configuration.
For instance, if the second bit of
.Va rate
is set, in the
.Va sa_conf
structure, then the second element of the
.Va rate[SA_NRATE]
array of the
.Va sa_cap
structure is valid for this configuration.
.El
.Ss Starting and stopping the stream
The
.Fn sa_start
routine puts the stream in a waiting state:
the stream will wait for playback data to be provided
(using the
.Fn sa_write
routine).
Once enough data is queued to ensure that play buffers
will not underrun, actual playback is started automatically.
If record mode only is selected, then recording starts
immediately.
In full-duplex mode, playback and recording will start
synchronously as soon as enough data to play is available.
.Pp
The
.Fn sa_stop
routine stops playback and recording and puts the audio subsystem
in the same state as after
.Fn sa_open
is called.
Samples in the play buffers are not discarded, and will continue to
be played after
.Fn sa_stop
returns.
.Ss Playing and recording
When record mode is selected, the
.Fn sa_read
routine must be called to retrieve recorded data; it must be called
often enough to ensure that internal buffers will not overrun.
It will store at most
.Ar nbytes
bytes at the
.Ar addr
location and return the number of bytes stored.
Unless the
.Ar nbio_flag
flag is set, it will block until data becomes available and
will return zero only on error.
.Pp
Similarly, when play mode is selected, the
.Fn sa_write
routine must be called to provide data to play.
Unless the
.Ar nbio_flag
is set,
.Fn sa_write
will block until the requested amount of data is written.
.Ss Non-blocking mode operation
If the
.Ar nbio_flag
is set on
.Fn sa_open ,
then the
.Fn sa_read
and
.Fn sa_write
routines will never block; if no data is available, they will
return zero immediately.
.Pp
Note that non-blocking mode must be used on bidirectional streams.
For instance, if recording is blocked in
.Fn sa_read
then, even if samples can be played,
.Fn sa_write
cannot be called and the play buffers may underrun.
.Pp
To avoid busy loops when non-blocking mode is used, the
.Xr poll 2
system call can be used to check if data can be
read from or written to the stream.
The
.Fn sa_pollfd
routine fills the array
.Ar pfd
of
.Va pollfd
structures, used by
.Xr poll 2 ,
with
.Ar events ;
the latter is a bit-mask of
.Va POLLIN
and
.Va POLLOUT
constants; refer to
.Xr poll 2
for more details.
.Fn sa_pollfd
returns the number of
.Va pollfd
structures filled.
The
.Fn sa_revents
routine returns the bit-mask set by
.Xr poll 2
in the
.Va pfd
array of
.Va pollfd
structures.
If
.Va POLLIN
is set,
.Fn sa_read
can be called without blocking.
If
.Va POLLOUT
is set,
.Fn sa_write
can be called without blocking.
.Pp
The
.Fn sa_nfds
routine returns the number of
.Va pollfd
structures the caller must preallocate in order to be sure
that
.Fn sa_pollfd
will never overrun.
.Ss Synchronizing non-audio events to the stream in real-time
In order to perform actions at precise positions of the stream,
such as displaying video in sync with the audio stream,
the application must be notified in real-time of the exact
position in the stream the hardware is processing.
.Pp
The
.Fn sa_onmove
routine can be used to register the
.Va cb
call-back function that will be called by the
.Nm
library at regular time intervals to notify the application
the position in the stream changed.
The
.Va delta
argument contains the number of frames the hardware moved in the stream
since the last call of
.Va cb .
The value of the
.Va arg
pointer is passed to the call-back and can contain anything.
.Pp
If desired, the application can maintain the current position by
starting from zero (when
.Fn sa_start
is called) and adding to the current position
.Va delta
every time
.Fn cb
is called.
Note that at the beginning the current position might be
negative indicating that the stream is being buffered,
but has not reached the hardware yet.
.Ss Measuring the latency and buffers usage
The playback latency is the delay it will take for the
frame just written to become audible, expressed in number of frames.
The exact playback
latency can be obtained by subtracting the current position
from the number of frames written.
Once playback is actually started (first sample audible)
the latency will never exceed the
.Va bufsz
parameter (see the sections above).
There's a phase during which
.Fn sa_write
only queues data;
once there's enough data, actual playback starts.
During this phase the current position is negative and
the latency might be longer than
.Va bufsz .
.Pp
In any cases, at most
.Va bufsz
frames are buffered.
This value takes into account all buffers,
including device, kernel and socket buffers.
During the buffering phase, the number of frames stored
is equal to the number of frames written.
Once playback is started, it is equal to the number of frames
written minus the current position.
.Pp
The recording latency is obtained similarly, by subtracting
the number of frames read from the current position.
.Pp
It is strongly discouraged to use the latency and/or the buffer
usage for anything but monitoring.
Especially, note that
.Fn sa_write
might block even if there is buffer space left;
using the buffer usage to guess if
.Fn sa_write
would block is false and leads to unreliable programs \(en consider using
.Xr poll 2
for this.
.Ss Handling buffer overruns and underruns
When the application cannot accept recorded data fast enough,
the record buffer (of size
.Va bufsz )
might overrun; in this case recorded data is lost.
Similarly if the application cannot provide data to play
fast enough, the play buffer underruns and silence is played
instead.
Depending on the
.Va xrun
parameter of the
.Va sa_par
structure, the audio subsystem will behave as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "SA_IGNORE"
.It SA_IGNORE
The stream is paused during overruns and underruns,
thus the current position (obtained through
.Va sa_onmove )
stops being incremented.
Once the overrun and/or underrun condition is gone, the stream is unpaused;
play and record are always kept in sync.
With this mode, the application cannot notice
underruns and/or overruns and shouldn't care about them.
.Pp
This mode is the default.
It's suitable for applications,
like audio players and telephony, where time
is not important and overruns or underruns are not short.
.It SA_SYNC
If the play buffer underruns, then silence is played,
but in order to reach the right position in time,
the same amount of written samples will be
discarded once the application is unblocked.
Similarly, if the record buffer overruns, then
samples are discarded, but the same amount of silence will be
returned later.
The current position (obtained through
.Va sa_onmove )
is still incremented.
When the play buffer underruns the play latency might become negative;
when the record buffer overruns, the record latency might become
larger than
.Va bufsz .
.Pp
This mode is suitable for applications, like music production,
where time is important and where underruns or overruns are
short and rare.
.It SA_ERROR
With this mode, on the first play buffer underrun or
record buffer overrun, the stream is terminated and
no other function than
.Fn sa_close
will succeed.
.Pp
This mode is mostly useful for testing; portable
applications shouldn't depend on it, since it's not available
on other systems.
.El
.Ss Error handling
Errors related to the audio subsystem
(like hardware errors, dropped connections) and
programming errors (e.g. call to
.Fn sa_read
on a play-only stream) are considered fatal.
Once an error occurs, all functions taking a
.Va sa_hdl
argument, except
.Fn sa_close
and
.Fn sa_eof ,
stop working (i.e. always return 0).
.Pp
The
.Fn sa_eof
routine can be used at any stage;
it returns 0 if there's no pending error, and a non-zero
value if there's an error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn sa_open
function returns the newly created handle on success or NULL
on failure.
The
.Fn sa_setpar ,
.Fn sa_getpar ,
.Fn sa_start ,
and
.Fn sa_stop ,
functions return 1 on success and 0 on failure.
The
.Fn sa_read
and
.Fn sa_write
functions return the number of bytes transfered.

.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh BUGS
The
.Xr audio 4
driver cannot drain playback buffers in the background, thus if
.Nm
is used to directly access an
.Xr audio 4
device,
the
.Fn sa_stop
routine will stop playback immediately.
.Pp
The
.Xr aucat 1
server doesn't implement flow control (for performance reasons).
If the application doesn't consume recorded data fast enough then
.Dq "control messages"
are delayed (or lost) and consequently
overruns and underruns stay unnoticed by the application in the
.Va SA_SYNC
mode (overruns and underruns are handled on the server side, so
synchronization is never lost).
.Pp
The
.Fn sa_open ,
.Fn sa_setpar ,
.Fn sa_getpar ,
.Fn sa_start
and
.Fn sa_stop
routines may block for a very short period of time, thus they should
not be abused during performance.
