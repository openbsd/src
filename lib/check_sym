#  check_sym -- compare the symbols and external function references in two
#	versions of a shared library
#
#  SYNOPSIS
#	check_sym [-ch] [old [new]]
#
#  DESCRIPTION
#	Library developers need to be aware when they have changed the
#	ABI of a library.  To assist them, check_sym examines two versions
#	of a shared library and reports changes to the following:
#	 * the set of exported symbols and their strengths
#	 * the set of undefined symbols referenced
#	 * the set of lazily-resolved functions (PLT)
#
#	In each case, additions and removals are reported; for exported
#	symbols it also reports when a symbol is weakened or strengthened.
#
#	The shared libraries to compare can be specified on the
#	command-line.  Otherwise, check_sym expects to be run from the
#	source directory of a library with a shlib_version file specifying
#	the version being built and the new library in the obj subdirectory.
#	If the old library to compare against wasn't specified either then
#	check_sym will take the highest version of that library in the
#	*current* directory, or the highest version of that library in
#	/usr/lib if it wasn't present in the current directory.
#
#	check_sym uses fixed names in /tmp for its intermediate files,
#	as they contain useful details for those trying to understand
#	what changed.  If any of them cannot be created by the user,
#	the command will fail.  The files can be cleaned up using
#	the -c option.
#
#
#	The *basic* rules of thumb for library versions are: if you
#	 * stop exporting a symbol, or
#	 * change the size of a data symbol
#	 * start exporting a symbol that an inter-dependent library needs
#	then you need to bump the MAJOR version of the library.
#
#	Otherwise, if you:
#	 * start exporting a symbol
#	then you need to bump the MINOR version of the library.

#
#  CAVEATS
#	The elf format is infinitely extendable, but check_sym only
#	handles a few weirdnesses.  Running it on or against new archs
#	may result in meaningless results.
#
#  BUGS
#	While the author stills find the intermediate files useful,
#	most people won't.  By default they should be placed in a
#	temp directory and removed.
