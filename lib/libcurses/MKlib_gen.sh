# MKlib_gen.sh -- generate sources from curses.h macro definitions
#
# ($Id: MKlib_gen.sh,v 1.1 1996/12/16 08:43:21 tholo Exp $)
#
# The XSI Curses standard requires all curses entry points to exist as
# functions, even though many definitions would normally be shadowed
# by macros.  Rather than hand-hack all that code, we actually
# generate functions from the macros.
#
# This script accepts a file of prototypes on standard input.  It discards
# any that don't have a `generated' comment attached. It then parses each
# prototype (relying on the fact that none of the macros take function 
# pointer or array arguments) and generates C source from it.
#
# Here is what the pipeline stages are doing:
#
# 1. sed: extract prototypes of generated functions
# 2. sed: decorate prototypes with generated arguments a1. a2,...z
# 3. awk: generate the calls with args matching the formals 
# 4. sed: prefix function names in prototypes so the preprocessor won't expand
#         them.
# 5. cpp: macroexpand the file so the macro calls turn into C calls
# 6. awk: strip the expansion junk off the front and add the new header
# 7. sed: squeeze spaces, strip off gen_ prefix, create needed #undef
#
