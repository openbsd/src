This is a list of things that still need to be done:

* Add 
      pthread_condattr_[gs]etpshared()	-- and add warn_references
      pthread_mutexattr_[gs]etprioceiling()
      pthread_mutexattr_[gs]etprotocol()
      pthread_mutexattr_[gs]etpshared()
      pthread_mutex_[gs]etprioceiling()
      sched_setparam()
      sched_setscheduler()

* Add _warn_references to the schedprio stuff
* Quiz jb about pthread_llist_remove.. change name to _thread_llist_remove?
	- what pthread_setprio() and pthread_yield() for?
	- shouldn't pthread_yield() be marked depreciated?

* Add thread stuff to the other archs in libc/arch/; ie change
  some usages of ENTRY to SYSENTRY in some .S files and add
  the new macros to their SYS.h. 

* Test that thread_init is automatically called on every arch, regardless
  of whether the exe is statically linked or not.

* Alter the objective-C compiler to see if it can use threads.
  It looks like the easy way is to just define CC='cc -pthread'.

* Find all the static buffers in libc and make them per-thread. This
  is not absolutely necessary but incurs no penalty for single-threaded
  operation, and makes life easier & safer for when threads are used.
  On the other hand, it adds a bit more code bloat when you use threads
  and makes openbsd programs non-portable to other OSs with less-nicer
  libraries. If we do the bare posix minimum, we promote portable code.
  
* Look into how netbsd are going with their kernel threads

* Look into how asynchronous I/O can help us. In particular, the
  (unimplemented) aio*() functions.

* Update the libc manual pages to describe the posix re-entrant functions.
  Although this is actually trivial to do, I have to decide on a
  consistent way of adding them - maybe `.Sh THREAD-SAFE FUNCTIONS' ?
  Should look into standards to see what they suggest/did..
  May also need to document "This is not thread-safe" for some library
  functions (yet to be identified).

* Find out where freebsd/netbsd use pread() and pwrite().. i think
  its in the database routines mostly. We will need to rip their code.

* Figure out what to do with the configuration system variables (_SC_*)
  that are defined by POSIX 1003.1c (at least update sysconf(3))
