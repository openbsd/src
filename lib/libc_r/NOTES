Notes on the OpenBSD threaded C library  (-lc_r)
================================================

Sources

  The main bulk of this library came from:
   . FreeBSD's libc_r (John Birrell)
     - The scheduler and locking code in the uthread directory.
     - Some of the manual pages in the man directory.
     - <pthreads.h>
   . MIT pthreads (Chris Provenzano)
     - The test code in the TEST directory

  I'm mainly tracking changes in FreeBSD's libc_r and integrating them
  as I can. The major changes to Birrell's code involved making the
  context switching a bit more architecture-independent.

Standards

  This implementation has also been mindful of:
   . Posix Threads[1]
   . Single Unix Specification[2]

Header files

  Only the absolutely required re-entrant functions have been added to
  the C library interface headers in /usr/src/include. 

  The new functions are:
	readdir_r()		<dirent.h>
	sigwait()		<signal.h>
	flockfile()		<stdio.h>
	ftrylockfile()		<stdio.h>
	funclockfile()		<stdio.h>
	getc_unlocked()		<stdio.h>
	getchar_unlocked()	<stdio.h>
	putc_unlocked()		<stdio.h>
	putchar_unlocked()	<stdio.h>
	rand_r()		<stdlib.h>
	strtok_r()		<string.h>
	asctime_r()		<time.h>
	ctime_r()		<time.h>
	gmtime_r()		<time.h>
	localtime_r()		<time.h>

  The widely used, but non-standard, gethostbyname_r() needs thought.

  These functions are available even when not using the thread package;
  i.e., they are also in the non-threaded libc.a. 

  See below why <sys/errno.h> has not been changed.

Changes to libc sources

  The approach taken to making the libc functions re-entrant was to
  develop some macros that handle:
	. file locking
	. monitors (thread-shared data structure locking)
	. per-thread private data structure allocation

  Macros were used to avoid copious amounts of #ifdef statements[3].

  In the non-threaded libc, file locking and the monitors are no-ops;
  the per-thread private data structures were previously declared static
  and the macros maintain this.

  In the threaded libc_r, file locking is as per the FreeBSD file
  descriptor locking, and the monitors are pthread_mutex operations.
  Per-thread private data structures use the pthread_specific functions
  to dynamically allocate memory on their first use, initialising
  them from the static (and hidden) per-compilation-unit data structures.

Errno

  Unlike the FreeBSD and MIT pthreads package, errno is not a macro;
  instead it is part of the per-thread context and saved and restored like
  a register. This has several advantages over the errno-as-a-macro method:

    - The syscall/cerror code does not have to be re-written
    - Libraries compiled without thread support will still work
    - Easier to port packages that use errno, but don't include <errno.h>

  The overhead of saving and restoring an integer was considered too tiny
  to worry about in comparison to the huge penalty hit of handling a
  signal and restoring the rest of a thread's context.

  It has been pointed out that this technique will not work in a
  mutiprocessor environment, and this is quite true. However the following
  reasons are quite persuasive:

    - OpenBSD does not do MP (yet)
    - This (FreeBSD uthread) implementation will not work in an MP 
      environment anyway because _thread_run is not a cpu-local variable.
    - There is a lot of coupling between binary ports and old libc and
      other libraries that is quite a big headache to resolve in a
      friendly manner.

Compiler Support

  The in-tree gcc had its config/openbsd.h modified to support a
  `-pthread' switch. Using this switch defines _POSIX_THREADS for cpp, and
  replaces the normal -lc linker option with -lc_r. 

  The objective-C component was also made aware of posix threads, via
  the configure switch --enable-threads=posix.

Changes to FreeBSD uthreads

  The following significant changes have been made to John Birrell's
  uthreads implementation:

    - the SIGINFO handler generates much more friendly output

Caveats

  Not everything above is working right now: read the TODO file.
