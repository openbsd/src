Notes on the OpenBSD threaded C library  (-lc_r)
================================================

Sources

  The main bulk of this library came from:
   . FreeBSD's libc_r (John Birrell)
     - The scheduler and locking code in the uthread directory.
     - Some of the manual pages in the man directory.
     - <pthreads.h>
   . MIT pthreads (Chris Provenzano)
     - The test code in the TEST directory

  I'm mainly tracking changes in FreeBSD's libc_r and integrating
  them as I can. The major changes are outlined at the end of this
  file.

Standards

  This implementation has also been mindful of:
   . Posix Threads[1]
   . Single Unix Specification[2]

Conformance

  Only the absolutely required re-entrant functions have been added
  to the C library interface headers (in /usr/src/include).

  The conformance goals used were: minimal implementation; strict
  conformance with standard; provide reasonable utility when standards
  are spineless (e.g., our asynchronous cancel is eager even though
  POSIX says async cancels may be acted upon at any time -- ie
  never.)

  The widely used, but non-standard, gethostbyname_r() has been
  half-heartily added (but not prototyped in a header - see source
  for details).  Please contact me if you have pointers to
  standards/comments about this function.

  Re-entrant functions added for the standards have also been made 
  available to libc (i.e. without the need to define _POSIX_THREADS).

Change strategy in libc

  The approach taken in making the libc functions re-entrant was to
  develop some macros that handle:
	. file locking
	. monitors (thread-shared data structure locking)
	. per-thread private data structure allocation

  These macros were used to avoid copious amounts of #ifdef
  statements[3].

  In the non-threaded libc, file locking and the monitors are no-ops;
  the per-thread private data structures were previously declared
  static and the macros maintain this.

  In the threaded libc_r, file locking is as per the FreeBSD file
  descriptor locking, and the monitors are pthread_mutex operations.
  Per-thread private data structures use the pthread_specific
  functions to dynamically allocate memory on their first use,
  initialising them from the static (and hidden) per-compilation-unit
  data structures.  In this way, each thread appears to have its
  very own private libc state.

Errno

  Unlike the FreeBSD and MIT pthreads package, errno is not a macro
  like __error(); instead it is part of the per-thread context:
  saved and restored like a register. This has several advantages
  over the errno-as-a-macro method:

    - The syscall/cerror code does not have to be re-written
    - Libraries compiled without thread support will still work
    - Easier to port old packages that use errno, but don't include
      <errno.h> to get the macro
    - No need to go through all sources and find where errno is
      used as a field name or formal parameter name.

  The overhead of saving and restoring an integer was considered
  too tiny to worry about in comparison to the huge penalty hit of
  handling a signal and restoring the rest of a thread's context.

  It has been pointed out that this technique will not work in a
  mutiprocessor environment, and this is quite true. However the
  following reasons are quite persuasive:

    - OpenBSD does not do MP (yet)
    - This (FreeBSD uthread) implementation will not work in an MP
      environment anyway because _thread_run is not a cpu-local
      variable.
    - There is a lot of coupling between binary ports, the 'old'
      libc and other standard libraries. It is predicted that it
      will be a huge headache to come up with a scheme that when
      someone tries to upgrade, everything won't break in a spectacular
      fashion, leaving bits of crippled ports, executables and
      shattered libraries everywhere.

Compiler support

  The in-tree gcc had its config/openbsd.h modified to support a
  `-pthread' switch. Using this switch defines _POSIX_THREADS for
  cpp, and replaces the normal -lc linker option with -lc_r.

  The objective-C component was also made aware of posix threads,
  via the configure switch --enable-threads=posix. {This has not
  been well tested though.}

Debugger support

  The in-tree gdb has been augmented to recognise when a executable
  linked with -lc_r is being debugged. All the documented gdb threads
  commands will then work. (Except you can't resume/step execution
  in a thread other than the 'current' one.)

  To get detailed state information, issue:

	(gdb) call _thread_dump_info()

  This will show what mutexes, condvars or file locks each process
  is waiting on. If you use _flockfile_debug() instead of flockfile()
  in your programs, source code references will appear in here too.
  (see <stdio.h>)

Changes to FreeBSD uthreads

  Although this implementation tracks the FreeBSD libc_r tree to
  a large extent, the following significant changes have been made 
  to John Birrell's uthreads implementation that have yet to appear
  (or may never appear) in FreeBSD's implementation:

    - architecture independent code generalised and moved out of
      #ifdef's[3] (now support for sparc, mips, m68k, powerpc added
      to i386, alpha)
    - the SIGINFO handler generates much more friendly/useful output
    - an implementation of poll() {probably bogus, but X11 seems to
      work}
    - an implementation of pthread_cancel()
    - an implementation of pthread_[gs]etscope() {bogus}
    - removal of the freebsd's support for init(8) {i.e., pid == 1}

Caveats

  This library is not 100% standards compliant - yet. It is certainly
  moving in that direction though. There are still some unresolved
  isseues, and the interested reader is directed towards the TODO
  file.

Acknowledgements

   Lots of kudos to Chris Provenzano et al. for the original
   MIT-pthreads implementation that I still read to get ideas; and
   also to John Birrell and the other FreeBSD developers who
   consistently write high quality code. The help rendered from the
   OpenBSD developers was greatly appreciated - especially from
   Todd Fries.
