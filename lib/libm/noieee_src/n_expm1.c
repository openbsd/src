/* EXPM1(X)
 * RETURN THE EXPONENTIAL OF X MINUS ONE
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (IEEE 53 BITS, VAX D FORMAT 56 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 1/19/85;
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 2/6/85, 3/7/85, 3/21/85, 4/16/85.
 *
 * Required system supported functions:
 *	scalbn(x,n)
 *	copysign(x,y)
 *	isfinite(x)
 *
 * Kernel function:
 *	exp__E(x,c)
 *
 * Method:
 *	1. Argument Reduction: given the input x, find r and integer k such
 *	   that
 *	                   x = k*ln2 + r,  |r| <= 0.5*ln2 .
 *	   r will be represented as r := z+c for better accuracy.
 *
 *	2. Compute EXPM1(r)=exp(r)-1 by
 *
 *			EXPM1(r=z+c) := z + exp__E(z,c)
 *
 *	3. EXPM1(x) =  2^k * ( EXPM1(r) + 1-2^-k ).
 *
 * 	Remarks:
 *	   1. When k=1 and z < -0.25, we use the following formula for
 *	      better accuracy:
 *			EXPM1(x) = 2 * ( (z+0.5) + exp__E(z,c) )
 *	   2. To avoid rounding error in 1-2^-k where k is large, we use
 *			EXPM1(x) = 2^k * { [z+(exp__E(z,c)-2^-k )] + 1 }
 *	      when k>56.
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	EXPM1(INF) is INF, EXPM1(NaN) is NaN;
 *	EXPM1(-INF)= -1;
 *	for finite argument, only EXPM1(0)=0 is exact.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	EXPM1(x) returns the exact (exp(x)-1) nearly rounded. In a test run with
 *	1,166,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum observed error was
 *	.872 ulps (units of the last place).
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.
