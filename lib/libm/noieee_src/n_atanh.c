/* ATANH(X)
 * RETURN THE HYPERBOLIC ARC TANGENT OF X
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (VAX D format 56 bits, IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 1/8/85;
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 2/7/85, 3/7/85, 8/18/85.
 *
 * Required kernel function:
 *	log1p(x) 	...return log(1+x)
 *
 * Method:
 *	Return
 *                          1              2x                          x

 *
 * Special cases:
 *	atanh(x) is NaN if |x| > 1 with signal;
 *	atanh(NaN) is that NaN with no signal;
 *	atanh(+-1) is +-INF with signal.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	atanh(x) returns the exact hyperbolic arc tangent of x nearly rounded.
 *	In a test run with 512,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum
 *	observed error was 1.87 ulps (units in the last place) at
 *	x= -3.8962076028810414000e-03.
