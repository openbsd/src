/* SINH(X)
 * RETURN THE HYPERBOLIC SINE OF X
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (VAX D format 56 bits, IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 1/8/85;
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 2/8/85, 3/7/85, 3/24/85, 4/16/85.
 *
 * Required system supported functions :
 *	copysign(x,y)
 *	scalbn(x,N)
 *
 * Required kernel functions:
 *	expm1(x)	...return exp(x)-1
 *
 * Method :
 *	1. reduce x to non-negative by sinh(-x) = - sinh(x).
 *	2.
 *
 *	                                      expm1(x) + expm1(x)/(expm1(x)+1)
 *	    0 <= x <= lnovfl     : sinh(x) := --------------------------------
 *			       		                      2
 *     lnovfl <= x <= lnovfl+ln2 : sinh(x) := expm1(x)/2 (avoid overflow)
 * lnovfl+ln2 <  x <  INF        :  overflow to INF
 *
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	sinh(x) is x if x is +INF, -INF, or NaN.
 *	only sinh(0)=0 is exact for finite argument.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	sinh(x) returns the exact hyperbolic sine of x nearly rounded. In
 *	a test run with 1,024,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum
 *	observed error was 1.93 ulps (units in the last place).
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.
