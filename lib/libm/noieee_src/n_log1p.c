/* LOG1P(x)
 * RETURN THE LOGARITHM OF 1+x
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (VAX D FORMAT 56 bits, IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 1/19/85;
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 2/6/85, 3/7/85, 3/24/85, 4/16/85.
 *
 * Required system supported functions:
 *	scalbn(x,n)
 *	copysign(x,y)
 *	logb(x)
 *	isfinite(x)
 *
 * Required kernel function:
 *	log__L(z)
 *
 * Method :
 *	1. Argument Reduction: find k and f such that
 *			1+x  = 2^k * (1+f),
 *	   where  sqrt(2)/2 < 1+f < sqrt(2) .
 *
 *	2. Let s = f/(2+f) ; based on log(1+f) = log(1+s) - log(1-s)
 *		 = 2s + 2/3 s**3 + 2/5 s**5 + .....,
 *	   log(1+f) is computed by
 *
 *	     		log(1+f) = 2s + s*log__L(s*s)
 *	   where
 *		log__L(z) = z*(L1 + z*(L2 + z*(... (L6 + z*L7)...)))
 *
 *	   See log__L() for the values of the coefficients.
 *
 *	3. Finally,  log(1+x) = k*ln2 + log(1+f).
 *
 *	Remarks 1. In step 3 n*ln2 will be stored in two floating point numbers
 *		   n*ln2hi + n*ln2lo, where ln2hi is chosen such that the last
 *		   20 bits (for VAX D format), or the last 21 bits ( for IEEE
 *		   double) is 0. This ensures n*ln2hi is exactly representable.
 *		2. In step 1, f may not be representable. A correction term c
 *	 	   for f is computed. It follows that the correction term for
 *		   f - t (the leading term of log(1+f) in step 2) is c-c*x. We
 *		   add this correction term to n*ln2lo to attenuate the error.
 *
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	log1p(x) is NaN with signal if x < -1; log1p(NaN) is NaN with no signal;
 *	log1p(INF) is +INF; log1p(-1) is -INF with signal;
 *	only log1p(0)=0 is exact for finite argument.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	log1p(x) returns the exact log(1+x) nearly rounded. In a test run
 *	with 1,536,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum observed
 *	error was .846 ulps (units in the last place).
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.
