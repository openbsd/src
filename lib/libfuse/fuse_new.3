.Sh NAME
.Nm fuse_new
.Nd FUSE implementation routine to intialise the FUSE connection
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In fuse.h
.Ft struct fuse *
.Fn fuse_new "struct fuse_chan *fc" "struct fuse_args *args" \
    "const struct fuse_operations *ops" "unused size_t size" \
    "void *userdata"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Initialises the FUSE library on the channel returned by
.Xr fuse_mount 3 .
.Pp
and passing this function the
.Em ops
argument containing all the callbacks of the filesystem.
FUSE operations work in the same way as their UNIX file system
counterparts. A major exception is that these routines return
a negated errno value (-errno) on failure.
.Pp
All operations are optional but functional file system will want to 
implement at least statfs, readdir, open, read and getattr.

There order of calls is:
init
...
opendir
readdir
releasedir
open
read
write
...
flush
release
...
destroy
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It access
Not implemented. OpenBSD always behaves as if the default_permissions
mount option was specified. See
.Xr fuse_mount 3 .
.It chmod
Called when file access permissions are changed.
.It chown
Called when either the file owner or group is changed.
.It create
Not implemented on OpenBSD. File systems must implement mknod instead.
In the reference implementation this is an atomic operation that both
creates and opens the file. There is no equivalent in the OpenBSD VFS.
.It getattr
Corresponds to the
.Xr stat 2
system call. flags and extended attributes are ignored. This operation
is mandatory.
.It getxattr
Not implemented.
.It flush
Called when the file is closed by the
.Xr close 2
system call. This is the only way for a file system to return an error
on close.
.It getdir
Deprecated. File system should implement readdir instead.
.It flush
Called when the file is closed by the
.Xr close 2
system call. This is the only way for a file system to return an error
on close.
.It mknod
Called on
.Xr open 2
and
.Xr mknod 2
to create regular files, pipes and device special files.
.It open
Called on
.Xr open 2 .
Due to the difference between FUSE and the OpenBSD VFS, open will only
be called once for each file for every different combination of flags
provided to
.Xr open 2.
The O_CREAT and O_TRUNC flags are never passed from the kernel to open,
the mknod and truncate operations are invoked before open instead.
.It opendir
Called when a directory is opened for reading.
.It release
Called when there are no more reference to the file.
.It releasedir
Called when there are no more reference to the directory.
.It setattr
Equivalent to
.Xr chown 2
and
.Xr chmod 2
system calls. Setting file flags is not supported.
.It setxattr
Not implemented.
.El
.Pp
Options supported by args are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It debug, -d
Print debug information to stdout.
.It gid=%u
The gid that will be reported as the group for all files by getattr.
.It hard_remove
Immediately delete a file even if it's currently open by a process.
Otherwise FUSE will temporarily rename the file and only delete it when
if is no longer reference. This is to avoid the file system having to
deal with this situation. This is always set on OpenBSD.
.It readdir_ino
Similar to use_ino but the file system's inode number is only reported
for readdir. This is always set on OpenBSD since it's needed by
.It uid=%u
The uid that will be reported as the owner for all files by getattr.
.It umask=%o
The file mode mask applied to the permission for all files by getattr.
.Xr getcwd 3 .
.It use_ino
By default, FUSE will return an internal inode number for getattr and
readdir and this will be different every time the file system is
mounted. If this is set the file system's own inode number will be
reported instead. Useful only for file system that have inode numbers.
