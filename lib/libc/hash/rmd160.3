.Sh DESCRIPTION
The RMD160 functions implement the 160-bit RIPE message digest hash algorithm
(RMD-160).  RMD-160 is used to generate a condensed representation
of a message called a message digest.  The algorithm takes a
message less than 2^64 bits as input and produces a 160-bit digest
suitable for use as a digital signature.
.Pp
The RMD160 functions are considered to be more secure than the 
.Xr md4 3
and
.Xr md5 3
functions and at least as secure as the
.Xr sha1 3
function.  All share a similar interface.
.Pp
The
.Fn RMD160Init
function initializes a RMD160_CTX
.Ar context
for use with
.Fn RMD160Update ,
and
.Fn RMD160Final .
The
.Fn RMD160Update
function adds
.Ar data
of length
.Ar nbytes
to the RMD160_CTX specified by
.Ar context.
.Fn RMD160Final
is called when all data has been added via
.Fn RMD160Update
and stores a message digest in the
.Ar digest
parameter.
When a null pointer is passed to
.Fn RMD160Final
as first argument only the final padding will be applied and the 
current context can still be used with
.Fn RMD160Update .
.Pp
The
.Fn RMD160Transform
function is used by
.Fn RMD160Update
to hash 512-bit blocks and forms the core of the algorithm.
Most programs should use the interface provided by
.Fn RMD160Init ,
.Fn RMD160Update
and
.Fn RMD160Final
instead of calling
.Fn RMD160Transform
directly.
.Pp
The
.Fn RMD160End
function is a front end for
.Fn RMD160Final
which converts the digest into an
.Tn ASCII
representation of the 160 bit digest in hexadecimal.
.Pp
The
.Fn RMD160File
function calculates the digest for a file and returns the result via
.Fn RMD160End .
If
.Fn RMD160File
is unable to open the file a NULL pointer is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn RMD160Data
function
calculates the digest of an arbitrary string and returns the result via
.Fn RMD160End .
.Pp
For each of the
.Fn RMD160End ,
.Fn RMD160File ,
and
.Fn RMD160Data
functions the
.Ar buf
parameter should either be a string of at least 41 characters in
size or a NULL pointer.  In the latter case, space will be dynamically
allocated via
.Xr malloc 3
and should be freed using
.Xr free 3
when it is no longer needed.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The follow code fragment will calculate the digest for
the string "abc" which is ``0x8eb208f7e05d987a9b044a8e98c6b087f15a0bfc''.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
RMD160_CTX rmd;
u_char results[20];
char *buf;
int n;

buf = "abc";
n = strlen(buf);
RMD160Init(&rmd);
RMD160Update(&rmd, (u_char *)buf, n);
RMD160Final(results, &rmd);

/* Print the digest as one long hex value */
printf("0x");
for (n = 0; n < 20; n++)
	printf("%02x", results[n]);
putchar('\\n');
.Ed
.Pp
Alternately, the helper functions could be used in the following way:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
RMD160_CTX rmd;
u_char output[41];
char *buf = "abc";

printf("0x%s\n", RMD160Data(buf, strlen(buf), output));
.Ed
.Sh CAVEATS
If a message digest is to be copied to a multi-byte type (ie:
an array of five 32-bit integers) it will be necessary to
perform byte swapping on little endian machines such as the i386, alpha,
and vax.
.Sh AUTHOR
This implementation of RMD-160 was written by Antoon Bosselaers.
.br
The
.Fn RMD160End ,
.Fn RMD160File ,
and
.Fn RMD160Data
helper functions are derived from code written by Poul-Henning Kamp.
