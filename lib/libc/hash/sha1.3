.Nd calculate the NIST Secure Hash Algorithm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sha1.h>
.Ft void
.Fn SHA1Init "SHA1_CTX *context"
.Ft void
.Fn SHA1Update "SHA1_CTX *context" "u_char *data" "u_int len"
.Ft void
.Fn SHA1Final "u_char digest[20]" "SHA1_CTX *context"
.Ft void
.Fn SHA1Transform "u_int32_t state[5]" "u_char buffer[64]"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The SHA1 functions implement then NIST Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1),
FIPS PUB 180-1.  SHA-1 is used to generate a condensed representation
of a message called a message digest.  The algorithm takes a
message less than 2^64 bits as input and produces a 160-bit digest
suitable for use as a digital signature.
.Pp
The SHA1 functions are considered to be more secure than the 
.Xr md4 3
and
.Xr md5 3
functions with which they share a similar interface.
.Pp
The
.Fn SHA1Init
function initializes a MDX_CTX
.Ar context
for use with
.Fn SHA1Update ,
and
.Fn SHA1Final .
The
.Fn SHA1Update
function adds
.Ar data
of length
.Ar len
to the SHA1_CTX specified by
.Ar context.
.Fn SHA1Final
is called when all data has been added via
.Fn SHA1Update
and stores a message digest in the
.Ar digest
parameter.
.Pp
The
.Fn SHA1Transform
function is used by
.Fn SHA1Update
to hash 512-bit blocks and forms the core of the algorithm.
Most programs should use the interface provided by
.Fn SHA1Init ,
.Fn SHA1Update
and
.Fn SHA1Final
instead of calling
.Fn SHA1Transform
directly.
.Sh EXAMPLE
The follow code fragment will calculate the digest for
the string "abc" which is ``0xa9993e36476816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d''.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
SHA1_CTX sha;
u_char results[20];
char *buf;
int n;

buf = "abc";
n = strlen(buf);
SHA1Init(&sha);
SHA1Update(&sha, (u_char *)buf, n);
SHA1Final(results, &sha);

/* Print the digest as one long hex value */
printf("0x");
for (n = 0; n < 20; n++)
	printf("%x", results[n]);
putchar('\n');
.Ed
.Sh CAVEATS
This implementation of SHA-1 has not been valdiated by NIST
and as such is not in official compliance with the standard.
.Pp
If a message digest is to be copied to a multi-byte type (ie:
an array of five 32-bit integers) it will be necesary to
perform byte swapping on little endian machines such as the i386, alpha,
and vax.
