.Sh DESCRIPTION
Those functions have been designed as a fast, extensible alternative to
the usual hash table functions.
They provide storage and retrieval of records indexed by keys,
where a key is a contiguous sequence of bytes at a fixed position in
each record.
Keys can either be null-terminated strings or fixed-size memory areas.
All functions take a pointer to an ohash structure as the
.Fa h
function argument.
Storage for this structure should be provided by user code.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_init
initializes the table to store roughly 2 to the power
.Fa size
elements.
.Fa info
holds the position of the key in each record, and two pointers to
.Xr calloc 3
and
.Xr free 3 Ns -like
functions, to use for managing the table internal storage.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_delete
frees storage internal to
.Fa h .
Elements themselves should be freed by the user first, using for instance
.Fn ohash_first
and
.Fn ohash_next .
.Pp
.Fn ohash_lookup_interval
and
.Fn ohash_lookup_memory
are the basic look-up element functions.
The hashing function result is provided by the user as
.Fa hv .
These return a
.Qq slot
in the ohash table
.Fa h ,
to be used with
.Fn ohash_find ,
.Fn ohash_insert ,
or
.Fn ohash_remove .
This slot is only valid up to the next call to
.Fn ohash_insert
or
.Fn ohash_remove .
.Pp
.Fn ohash_lookup_interval
handles string-like keys.
.Fn ohash_lookup_interval
assumes the key is the interval between
.Fa start
and
.Fa end ,
exclusive,
though the actual elements stored in the table should only contain
null-terminated keys.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_lookup_memory
assumes the key is the memory area starting at
.Fa k
of size
.Fa s .
All bytes are significant in key comparison.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_find
retrieves an element from a slot
.Fa i
returned by the
.Fn ohash_lookup*
functions.
It returns
.Dv NULL
if the slot is empty.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_insert
inserts a new element
.Fa p
at slot
.Fa i .
Slot
.Fa i
must be empty and element
.Fa p
must have a key corresponding to the
.Fn ohash_lookup*
call.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_remove
removes the element at slot
.Fa i .
It returns the removed element, for user code to dispose of, or
.Dv NULL
if the slot was empty.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_first
and
.Fn ohash_next
can be used to access all elements in an ohash table, like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
for (n = ohash_first(h, &i); n != NULL; n = ohash_next(h, &i))
	do_something_with(n);
.Ed
.Pp
.Fa i
points to an auxiliary unsigned integer used to record the current position
in the ohash table.
Those functions are safe to use even while entries are added to/removed
from the table, but in such a case they don't guarantee that new entries
will be returned.
As a special case, they can safely be used to free elements in the table.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_entries
returns the number of elements in the hash table.
.Sh STORAGE HANDLING
Only
.Fn ohash_init ,
.Fn ohash_insert ,
.Fn ohash_remove
and
.Fn ohash_delete
may call the user-supplied memory functions.
It is the responsibility of the user memory allocation code to verify
that those calls did not fail.
.Pp
If memory allocation fails,
.Fn ohash_init
returns a useless hash table.
.Fn ohash_insert
and
.Fn ohash_remove
still perform the requested operation, but the returned table should be
considered read-only.
It can still be accessed by
.Fn ohash_lookup* ,
.Fn ohash_find ,
.Fn ohash_first
and
.Fn ohash_next
to dump relevant information to disk before aborting.
.Sh THREAD SAFETY
The open hashing functions are not thread-safe by design.
In particular, in a threaded environment, there is no guarantee that a
.Qq slot
will not move between a
.Fn ohash_lookup*
and a
.Fn ohash_find ,
.Fn ohash_insert
or
.Fn ohash_remove
call.
.Pp
Multi-threaded applications should explicitly protect ohash table access.
