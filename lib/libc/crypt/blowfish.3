.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pa Blowfish
is a fast unpatented block cipher designed by Bruce Schneier.
It basically consists of a 16 times iterated Feistel network.
The block size is 64 bit and the key size is maximal 448 bit.
.Pp
The
.Fn blf_key
function initializes the 4 8bit S-boxes and the 18 Subkeys with
the hexadecimal digits of Pi. The key is used for further randomization.
The first argument to
.Fn blf_enc
is the initalized state derived from
.Fn blf_key .
The stream of 32-bit words is encrypted in Electronic Codebook
Mode (ECB) and
.Pa datalen
must be even.
.Fn blf_dec
is used for decrypting Blowfish encrypted blocks.
.Pp
The functions 
.Fn blf_ecb_encrypt
and
.Fn blf_ecb_decrypt 
are used for encrypting and decrypting octet streams in ECB mode.
The functions 
.Fn blf_cbc_encrypt
and
.Fn blf_cbc_decrypt 
are used for encrypting and decrypting octet streams in
Cipherblock Chaining Mode (CBC).
.Pp
The functions
.Fn Blowfish_initstate ,
.Fn Blowfish_expand0state ,
.Fn Blowfish_expandstate ,
.Fn Blowfish_encipher
and
.Fn Blowfish_decipher
are used for customization of the
.Pa Blowfish
cipher, e.g. for the blowfish password hashing function.
