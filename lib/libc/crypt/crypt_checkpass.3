.Sh NAME
.Nm crypt_checkpass ,
.Nm crypt_newhash
.Nd password hashing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn crypt_checkpass "const char *password" "const char *hash"
.Ft int
.Fn crypt_newhash "const char *password" "const char *pref" "char *hash" "size_t hashsize"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn crypt_checkpass
function is provided to simplify checking a user's password.
If both the
.Fa hash
and the
.Fa password
are the empty string, authentication
is a success.
Otherwise, the
.Fa password
is hashed and compared to the provided
.Fa hash .
If the
.Fa hash
is
.Dv NULL ,
authentication will always fail, but a default
amount of work is performed to simulate the hashing operation.
A successful match will return 0.
A failure will return \-1 and set
.Xr errno 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn crypt_newhash
function is provided to simplify the creation of new password hashes.
The provided
.Fa password
is randomly salted and hashed and stored in
.Fa hash .
The
.Fa pref
argument identifies the preferred hashing algorithm and parameters.
Possible values are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dq bcrypt,<rounds>
The bcrypt algorithm, where the value of rounds can be between 4 and 31 and
specifies the base 2 logarithm of the number of rounds.
The special rounds value
.Sq a
automatically selects rounds based on system performance.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std crypt_checkpass crypt_newhash
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn crypt_checkpass
function sets
.Va errno
to
.Er EACCESS
when authentication fails.
.Pp
The
.Fn crypt_newhash
function sets
.Va errno
to
.Er EINVAL
if
.Fa pref
is unsupported.

.Fn crypt_checkpass
first appeared in
