.Dt MQUERY 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mquery
.Nd provide mapping hints to applications
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mman.h>
.Ft int
.Fn mquery "int flags" "void **addr" "size_t size" "int fd" "off_t off"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mqeury
system call checks the existing memory mappings of a process and returns
hints to the caller about where to put a memory mapping.
This hint can be later used when performing memory mappings with the
.Fn mmap
system call with
.Dv MAP_FIXED
in the flags.
The
.Fa addr
argument should point to a memory location that stores a pointer
which is used both as an input argument where the caller specifies the
preferred address and as an output of the resulting hint.
The
.Fa size
argument specifies the requested size of the memory area the caller
is looking for.
The
.Fa fd
and
.Fa off
arguments specify the file that will be mapped and the offset in it,
this is the same as the corresponding arguments to
.Fn mmap .
.Pp
The behavior of the function depends on the
.Fa flags
argument.
If set to
.Dv MAP_FIXED
the pointer
.Fa *addr
is used as a fixed hint and
.Fn mquery
will return \-1 and set
.Va errno
to
.Dv ENOMEM
if there is not
.Fa size
bytes free after that address.
Otherwise it will return 0 and
.Fa *addr
will not be changed.
If no flags are set
.Fn mquery
will use
.Fa *addr
as a starting point in memory and will search forward to find
a memory area with
.Fa size
bytes free and that will be suitable for creating a mapping for the
file and offset specified in the
.Fa fd
and
.Fa off
arguments.
When no such area can be found
.Fn mquery
will return \-1 and set
.Va errno
to
.Dv ENOMEM .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
When a memory range satisfying the request is found
.Fn mquery
returns 0.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn mquery
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width ENOMEM
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
.Dv MAP_FIXED
was specified and the requested memory area is unavailable.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
There was not enough memory left after the hint specified.
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa fd
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mmap 2
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn mquery
function first appeared in
.Ox 3.4 .
