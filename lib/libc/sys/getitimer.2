.Sh DESCRIPTION
The system provides each process with three interval timers,
defined in
.Ao Pa sys/time.h Ac .
The
.Fn getitimer
call returns the current value for the timer specified in
.Fa which
in the structure at
.Fa value .
The
.Fn setitimer
call sets a timer to the specified
.Fa value
(returning the previous value of the timer if
.Fa ovalue
is non-null).
.Pp
A timer value is defined by the
.Fa itimerval
structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct itimerval {
	struct	timeval it_interval;	/* timer interval */
	struct	timeval it_value;	/* current value */
};
.Ed
.Pp
If
.Fa it_value
is non-zero, it indicates the time to the next timer expiration.
If
.Fa it_interval
is non-zero, it specifies a value to be used in reloading
.Fa it_value
when the timer expires.
Setting
.Fa it_value
to 0 disables a timer.
Setting
.Fa it_interval
to 0 causes a timer to be disabled after its next expiration (assuming
.Fa it_value
is non-zero).
.Pp
Time values smaller than the resolution of the
system clock are rounded up to this resolution
(typically 10 milliseconds).
.Pp
The
.Dv ITIMER_REAL
timer decrements in real time.
A
.Dv SIGALRM
signal is
delivered when this timer expires.
.Pp
The
.Dv ITIMER_VIRTUAL
timer decrements in process virtual time.
It runs only when the process is executing.
A
.Dv SIGVTALRM
signal is delivered when it expires.
.Pp
The
.Dv ITIMER_PROF
timer decrements both in process virtual time and
when the system is running on behalf of the process.
It is designed to be used by interpreters in statistically profiling
the execution of interpreted programs.
Each time the
.Dv ITIMER_PROF
timer expires, the
.Dv SIGPROF
signal is delivered.
Because this signal may interrupt in-progress
system calls, programs using this timer must be prepared to
restart interrupted system calls.
.Pp
The remaining five functions are in fact macros for manipulating time
values, defined in
.Ao Pa sys/time.h Ac .
.Pp
.Fn timerclear "a"
sets the time value in
.Fa a
to zero.
.Pp
.Fn timerisset "a"
tests if the time value in
.Fa a
is non-zero.
.Pp
.Fn timercmp "a, b, CMP"
compares two time values in the form
.Fa a
CMP
.Fa b ,
where
.Fa CMP
is <, <=, ==, !=, >=, or > .
.Pp
.Fn timersub "a, b, res"
subtracts
.Fa a
-
.Fa b
and stores the result in
.Fa res .
.Pp
.Fn timeradd "a, b, res"
adds two timers and stores the result in
.Fa res .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the calls succeed, a value of 0 is returned.
If an error occurs, the value \-1 is returned, and a more precise
error code is placed in the global variable
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn getitimer
and
.Fn setitimer
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa value
parameter specified a bad address.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
A
.Fa value
parameter specified a time that was too large to be handled.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An unrecognized value for
.Fa which
was specified.
