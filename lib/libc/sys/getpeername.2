.Dt GETPEERNAME 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getpeername
.Nd get name of connected peer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getpeername "int s" "struct sockaddr *name" "socklen_t *namelen"
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width namelen
.It s
Contains the file descriptor of the socket who's peer should be looked up.
.It name
Points to a sockaddr structure that will hold the address information
for the connected peer. The format of this socket depends on the protocol family in use. See
.Xr socket 2
for details.
.It namelen
Indicates the amount of space pointed to by
.Fa name ,
in bytes.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn getpeername
returns the address information of the peer connected to
socket
.Fa s .
.Pp
.Fn getpeername
is useful in a variety of circumstances. The most common
use occurs when a process inherits an open socket, such as when
.Xr inetd 8
forks and execs a TCP server. In this scenario,
.Fn getpeername
is used to determine the connecting client's IP address.
.Pp
If the local socket address is required, the
.Xr getsockname 2
function should be used instead.
.Pp
If
.Fa name
does not point to enough space to hold the entire socket address, the
result will be truncated to
.Fa namelen
bytes.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call succeeds, a 0 is returned and
.Fa namelen
is set to the actual size of the socket address returned in
.Fa name .
Otherwise, errno is set and a value of \-1 is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
On failure, errno is set to one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The argument
.Fa s
is not a valid descriptor.
.It Bq Er ENOTSOCK
The argument
.Fa s
is a file, not a socket.
.It Bq Er ENOTCONN
The socket is not connected.
.It Bq Er ENOBUFS
Insufficient resources were available in the system
to perform the operation.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa name
parameter points to memory not in a valid part of the
process address space.
