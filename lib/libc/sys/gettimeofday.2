.Dt GETTIMEOFDAY 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gettimeofday ,
.Nm settimeofday
.Nd get/set date and time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/time.h
.Ft int
.Fn gettimeofday "struct timeval *tp" "struct timezone *tzp"
.Ft int
.Fn settimeofday "const struct timeval *tp" "const struct timezone *tzp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The system's notion of the current Greenwich time is obtained with the
.Fn gettimeofday
call and set with the
.Fn settimeofday
call.
The time is expressed in seconds and microseconds
since midnight (0 hour), January 1, 1970.
The resolution of the system clock is hardware dependent, and the time
may be updated continuously or in
.Dq ticks .
If
.Fa tp
is
.Dv NULL ,
the time will not be returned or set.
The structure pointed to by
.Fa tp
is defined in
.In sys/time.h
as:
.Bd -literal
struct timeval {
	time_t		tv_sec;		/* seconds since Jan. 1, 1970 */
	suseconds_t	tv_usec;	/* and microseconds */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa tzp
parameter is historical and timezone information is no longer
tracked by the system.
All code should pass
.Dv NULL
for
.Fa tzp .
For
.Fn gettimeofday ,
if
.Fa tzp
is
.Pf non- Dv NULL
an empty
.Dv timezone
structure will be returned.
For
.Fn settimeofday ,
if
.Fa tzp
is
.Pf non- Dv NULL
its contents are ignored.
.Pp
Only the superuser may set the time of day.
If the system securelevel is greater than 1 (see
.Xr init 8 ) ,
the time may only be advanced.
This limitation is imposed to prevent a malicious superuser
from setting arbitrary time stamps on files.
The system time can still be adjusted backwards using the
.Xr adjtime 2
system call even when the system is secure.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn gettimeofday
and
.Fn settimeofday
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An argument address referenced invalid memory.
.El
.Pp
In addition,
.Fn settimeofday
may return the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa tp
specified a microsecond value less than zero or greater than or equal to
1 million.
.It Bq Er EPERM
A user other than the superuser attempted to set the time.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr date 1 ,
.Xr adjtime 2 ,
.Xr clock_gettime 2 ,
.Xr getitimer 2 ,
.Xr ctime 3 ,
.Xr time 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn gettimeofday
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
As predecessors of these functions, former system calls
.Fn time
and
.Fn stime
first appeared in
.At v1 ,
and
.Fn ftime
first appeared in
.At v7 .
The
.Fn gettimeofday
and
.Fn settimeofday
system calls first appeared in
.Bx 4.1c .
.Sh CAVEATS
Setting the time with
.Fn settimeofday
is dangerous; if possible use
.Xr adjtime 2
instead.
Many daemon programming techniques utilize time-delta techniques
using the results from
.Fn gettimeofday
instead of from
.Xr clock_gettime 2
on the
.Dv CLOCK_MONOTONIC
clock.
Time jumps can cause these programs to malfunction in unexpected ways.
If the time must be set, consider rebooting the machine for safety.
