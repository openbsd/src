.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getpeereid "int s" "uid_t *euid" "gid_t *egid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn getpeereid
returns the effective user ID and group ID of the peer connected to
the UNIX domain socket
.Fa s .
.Pp
One common use is for UNIX domain servers to determine the credentials
of clients that have connected to it.
.Pp
.Fn getpeereid
takes three parameters:
.Pp
.Fa s
Contains the file descriptor of the socket whose peer credentials
should be looked up.
.Pp
.Fa euid
Points to a
.Li uid_t
variable into which the effective user ID for the connected peer will
be stored.
.Pp
.Fa egid
Points to a
.Li gid_t
variable into which the effective group ID for the connected peer will
be stored.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call succeeds, a 0 is returned and
.Fa euid
and
.Fa egid
are set to the effective user ID and group ID of the connected peer.
Otherwise,
.Va errno
is set and a value of \-1 is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
On failure,
.Va errno
is set to one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
