.Dt __GET_TCB 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm __get_tcb ,
.Nm __set_tcb
.Nd "get and set the address of the thread-control-block of the current thread"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft void *
.Fn __get_tcb "void"
.Ft void
.Fn __set_tcb "void *"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn __get_tcb
and
.Fn __set_tcb
are for use by librthread and other parts of the system runtime to
retrieve and set the address of the current thread's TCB
(thread-control-block).
This is used to locate per-thread data such as
.Va errno .
Each kernel-level thread in a process has a separate value for this
address which can be obtained and changed via these system calls.
New threads (including the first thread of a new process) created using
.Xr fork 2 ,
.Xr vfork 2 ,
or
.Xr rfork 2 ,
start with this address set to zero.
Similarly,
.Xr execve 2
resets it to zero.
.Pp
On some platforms, this address is also directly mapped to a CPU
register which can be accessed from userspace.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn __get_tcb
returns the address of the thread-control-block of the current thread.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rfork 2
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn __get_tcb
and
.Fn __set_tcb
system calls appeared in
.Ox 5.1 .
