.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines convert 16 and 32 bit quantities between different
byte orderings.  The "swap" functions reverse the byte ordering of
the given quantity, the others converts either from/to the native
byte order used by the host to/from either little- or big-endian (a.k.a
network) order.
.Pp
Apart from the "swap" functions, the names can be described by this form:
{src-order}to{dst-order}{size}.
Both {src-order} and {dst-order} can take the following forms:
.Bl -tag -width "be "
.It Em h
host order
.It Em n
network order (big-endian)
.It Em be
big-endian (Most significant byte first)
.It Em le
little-endian (Least significant byte first)
.El
.Pp
One of the specified orderings must be "h".
{Size} will take these forms:
.Bl -tag -width "32 "
.It Em l
long (32-bit, used in conjunction with forms involving "n")
.It Em s
short (16-bit, used in conjunction with forms involving "n")
.It Em 16
16-bit
.It Em 32
32-bit
.El
.Pp
The "swap" functions are of the form: swap{size}.
.Pp
Names involving "n" convert quantities between network
byte order and host byte order.  The last letter (s/l) is a mnemonic
for the traditional names for such quantities, short and long,
respectively.  Today, the C concept of "short"/"long" integers
need not coincide with this traditional misunderstanding.
On machines which have a byte order which is the same as the network
order, routines are defined as null macros.
.Pp
The functions involving either "be", "le" or "swap" use the numbers
(16/32) for specifying the bitwidth of the quantities they operate on.
Currently all supported architectures are either big- or little-endian
so either the "be" or the "le" variants are implemented as null macros.
.Pp
The routines mentioned above which have either {src-order} or {dst-order}
set to "n" are most often used in
conjunction with Internet addresses and ports as returned by
.Xr gethostbyname 3
and
.Xr getservent 3 .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm byteorder
functions appeared in 
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
On the
.Tn vax ,
.Tn alpha ,
.Tn i386 ,
and so far
.Tn mips
bytes are handled backwards from most everyone else in
the world.  This is not expected to be fixed in the near future.
