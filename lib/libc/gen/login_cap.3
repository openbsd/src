.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn login_getclass
function extracts the entry specified by
.Ar class
(or
.Li default
if
.Ar class
is NULL or the empty string)
from
.Pa /etc/login.conf
(see
.Xr login.conf 5 ) .
If the entry is found, a
.Li login_cap_t
pointer is returned.
NULL is returned if the user class is not found.
When the
.Li login_cap_t
structure is no longer needed, is should be freed by the
.Fn login_close
function.
.Pp
Once
.Ar lc
has been returned by
.Fn login_getclass ,
any of the other
.Fn login_*
functions may be called.
The
.Fn login_getstyle
function
is used to obtain the style of authentication that should be used for
this user class.
The
.Ar style
argument may either be NULL or the desired style of authentication.
If NULL, the first available authentication style will be used.
The
.Ar type
argument refers to the type of authentication being performed.
This is used to override the standard
.Li auth
entry in the database.  By convention this should be of the form "auth-type".
Future releases may remove the requirement for the "auth-" prefix and add
it if it is missing.
If
.Ar type
is NULL then only "auth" will be looked at.
(See
.Xr login.conf 5 ) .
The
.Fn login_getstyle 
function will return NULL if the desired style of authentication
is not available, or if no style is available.
.Pp
The
.Fn login_getcapnum ,
.Fn login_getcapsize ,
.Fn login_getcapstr ,
and
.Fn login_getcaptime
functions all query the database entry for a field named
.Ar cap .
If the field is found, its value is returned.  If the field is not
found, the value specified by
.Ar def
is returned.
If an error is encountered while trying to find the field,
.Ar err
is returned.
See
.Xr login.conf 5
for a discussion of the various textual forms the value may take.
The
.Fn login_getcapbool
function is slightly different.  It returns
.Ar def
if no capabilities were found for this class (typically meaning that
the default class was used and the
.Li /etc/login.conf
file is missing).
It returns a non-zero value if 
.Ar cap ,
with no value, was found,
zero otherwise.
.Pp
The
.Fn secure_path
function takes a path name and returns 0 if the path name is secure, -1
if not.
To be secure a path must
exist,
be a regular file (and not a directory),
owned by root,
and only writable by the owner (root).
.Pp
The
.Fn setclasscontext
function takes
.Ar class ,
the name of a user class,
and sets the resources defined by that class according to
.Ar flags.
Only the
.Nm LOGIN_SETPATH ,
.Nm LOGIN_SETPRIORITY ,
.Nm LOGIN_SETRESOURCES ,
and
.Nm LOGIN_SETUMASK
bits are used.  (See 
.Fn setusercontext
below).
It returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn setusercontext
function
sets the resources according to
.Ar flags .
The
.Ar lc
argument, if not NULL, contains the class information that should
be used.
The
.Ar pwd
argument, if not NULL, provides information about the user.
Both
.Ar lc
and
.Ar pwd
cannot be NULL.
The
.Ar uid
argument is used in place of the user id contained in the
.Ar pwd
structure when calling
.Xr setuid 2 .
The various bits available to be or-ed together to make up
.Ar flags
are:
.Bl -tag -width LOGIN_SETRESOURCESXX
.It LOGIN_SETGROUP
Set the group id and call
.Xr initgroups 3 .
Requires the
.Xr pwd
field be specified.
.It LOGIN_SETLOGIN
Sets the login name by
.Xr setlogin 2 .
Requires the
.Ar pwd
field be specified.
.It LOGIN_SETPATH
Sets the
.Ev PATH
environment variable.
.It LOGIN_SETPRIORITY
Sets the priority by
.Xr setpriority 2 .
.It LOGIN_SETRESOURCES
Sets the various system resources by
.Xr setrlimit 2 .
.It LOGIN_SETUMASK
Sets the umask by
.Xr umask 2 .
.It LOGIN_SETUSER
Sets the user id to
.Ar uid
by
.Xr setuid 2 .
.It LOGIN_SETALL
Sets all of the above.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function first appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The string returned by
.Fn login_getcapstr
is allocated via
.Xr malloc 3
when the specified capability is present and thus it is the responsibility
of the caller to
.Fn free
this space.  However, if the the capability was not found or an error
occurred and
.Fa def
or
.Fa err
(whichever is relevant) are non-NUL the returned value is simply what
was passed in to
.Fn login_getcapstr .
Therefore it is not possible to blindly
.Fn free
the return value without first checking it against
.Fa def
and
.Fa err .
