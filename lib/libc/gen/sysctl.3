.Sh NAME
.Nm sysctl
.Nd get or set system information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/sysctl.h>
.Ft int
.Fn sysctl "int *name" "u_int namelen" "void *oldp" "size_t *oldlenp" "void *newp" "size_t newlen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sysctl
function retrieves system information and allows processes with
appropriate privileges to set system information.
The information available from
.Fn sysctl
consists of integers, strings, and tables.
Information may be retrieved and set from the command interface
using the
.Xr sysctl 8
utility.
.Pp
Unless explicitly noted below,
.Fn sysctl
returns a consistent snapshot of the data requested.
Consistency is obtained by locking the destination
buffer into memory so that the data may be copied out without blocking.
Calls to
.Fn sysctl
are serialized to avoid deadlock.
.Pp
The state is described using a
.Dq Management Information Base (MIB)
style name, listed in
.Fa name ,
which is a
.Fa namelen
length array of integers.
.Pp
The information is copied into the buffer specified by
.Fa oldp .
The size of the buffer is given by the location specified by
.Fa oldlenp
before the call,
and that location gives the amount of data copied after a successful call.
If the amount of data available is greater
than the size of the buffer supplied,
the call supplies as much data as fits in the buffer provided
and returns with the error code
.Er ENOMEM .
If the old value is not desired,
.Fa oldp
and
.Fa oldlenp
should be set to
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The size of the available data can be determined by calling
.Fn sysctl
with a
.Dv NULL
parameter for
.Fa oldp .
The size of the available data will be returned in the location pointed to by
.Fa oldlenp .
For some operations, the amount of space may change often.
For these operations,
the system attempts to round up so that the returned size is
large enough for a call to return the data shortly thereafter.
.Pp
To set a new value,
.Fa newp
is set to point to a buffer of length
.Fa newlen
from which the requested value is to be taken.
If a new value is not to be set,
.Fa newp
should be set to
.Dv NULL
and
.Fa newlen
set to 0.
.Pp
The top level names are defined with a
.Dv CTL_
prefix in
.Aq Pa sys/sysctl.h ,
and are as follows.
The next and subsequent levels down are found in the include files
listed here, and described in separate sections below.
.Pp

For example, the following retrieves the maximum number of processes allowed
in the system:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int mib[2], maxproc;
size_t len;

mib[0] = CTL_KERN;
mib[1] = KERN_MAXPROC;
len = sizeof(maxproc);
sysctl(mib, 2, &maxproc, &len, NULL, 0);
.Ed
.Pp
To retrieve the standard search path for the system utilities:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int mib[2];
size_t len;
char *p;

mib[0] = CTL_USER;
mib[1] = USER_CS_PATH;
sysctl(mib, 2, NULL, &len, NULL, 0);
p = malloc(len);
sysctl(mib, 2, p, &len, NULL, 0);
.Ed
.Ss CTL_DEBUG
The debugging variables vary from system to system.
A debugging variable may be added or deleted without need to recompile
.Fn sysctl
to know about it.
Each time it runs,
.Fn sysctl
gets the list of debugging variables from the kernel and
displays their current values.
The system defines twenty
.Li struct ctldebug
variables named
.Va debug0
through
.Va debug19 .
They are declared as separate variables so that they can be
individually initialized at the location of their associated variable.
The loader prevents multiple use of the same variable by issuing errors
if a variable is initialized in more than one place.
For example, to export the variable
.Va dospecialcheck
as a debugging variable, the following declaration would be used:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int dospecialcheck = 1;
struct ctldebug debug5 = { "dospecialcheck", &dospecialcheck };
.Ed

.Pp
The variables are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "123456"
.It Li ip.forwarding
Returns 1 when
.Tn IP
forwarding is enabled for the host,
indicating the host is acting as a router.
.It Li ip.redirect
Returns 1 when
.Tn ICMP
redirects may be sent by the host.
This option is ignored unless the host is routing
.Tn IP
packets,
and should normally be enabled on all systems.
.It Li ip.ttl
The maximum time-to-live (hop count) value for an
.Tn IP
packet sourced by
the system.
This value applies to normal transport protocols, not to
.Tn ICMP .
.It Li ip.encdebug
Returns 1 when error message reporting is enabled for the host.
If the kernel has been compiled with the
.Dv ENCDEBUG
option,
then debugging information will also be reported when this variable is set.
.It Li ip.ipsec-acl
If set to any non-zero value, incoming IPsec packets that are successfully
decrypted/authenticated are further validated against a list of acceptable
packet classes per Security Association.
When using automated key management, such as
.Xr isakmpd 8
or
.Xr photurisd 8 ,
the acceptable packet classes should be set up automatically.
When using manual keying, the appropriate entries have to be configured on a
per-SA basis via
.Xr ipsecadm 8 .
If this value is set to any non-zero value and no access control is
configured, IPsec packets will be dropped.
If set to 0, no testing of ingress packets will occur.
The default value (for now) is 0.
.It Li ip.ipsec-invalid-life
The lifetime of embryonic Security Associations (SAs that key management
daemons have reserved but not fully established yet) in seconds.

The default value is 60.
.It Li ip.ipsec-pfs
If set to any non-zero value, the kernel will ask the key management
daemons to use Perfect Forward Secrecy when establishing IPsec
Security Associations.
Perfect Forward Secrecy makes IPsec Security Associations
cryptographically distinct from each other, such that breaking the key
for one such SA does not compromise any others.
Requiring PFS for every security association significantly increases the
computational load of
.Xr isakmpd 8
exchanges.
The default value is 1.
.It Li ip.ipsec-soft-allocs
The number of IPsec flows that can use a security association before a
message is sent by the kernel to key management for renegotiation
of the security association.
If set to less than or equal to zero, no message is sent to key
management.
The default value is 0.
.It Li ip.ipsec-allocs
The number of IPsec flows that can use a security association before
it will expire.
If set to less than or equal to zero, the security association will not
expire because of this counter.
The default value is 0.
.It Li ip.ipsec-soft-bytes
The number of bytes that will be processed by a security association
before a message is sent by the kernel to key management for
renegotiation of the security association.
If set to less than or equal to zero, no message is sent to key
management.
The default value is 0.
.It Li ip.ipsec-bytes
The number of bytes that will be processed by a security association
before it will expire.
If set to less than or equal to zero, the security association will not
expire because of this counter.
The default value is 0.
.It Li ip.ipsec-soft-timeout
The number of seconds after a security association is established
before a message is sent by the kernel to key management for
renegotiation of the security association.
If set to less than or equal to zero, no message is sent to key
management.
The default value is 80000 seconds.
.It Li ip.ipsec-timeout
The number of seconds after a security association is established
before it will expire.
If set to less than or equal to zero, the security association will
not expire because of this timer.
The default value is 86400 seconds.
.It Li ip.ipsec-soft-firstuse
The number of seconds after a security association is first used
before a message is sent by the kernel to key management for
renegotiation of the security association.
If set to less than or equal to zero, no message is sent to key
management.
The default value is 3600 seconds.
.It Li ip.ipsec-firstuse
The number of seconds after a security association is first use before
it will expire.
If set to less than or equal to zero, the security association will
not expire because of this timer.
The default value is 7200 seconds.
.It Li ip.ipsec-enc-alg
This is the default encryption algorithm the kernel will instruct key
management daemons to negotiate when establishing security
associations on behalf of the kernel.
Such security associations can occur as a result of a process having
requested some security level through
.Xr setsockopt 3 ,
or as a result of dynamic
.Xr vpn 8
entries.
Supported values are des, 3des, blowfish, cast128, and skipjack.
If set to any other value, it is left to the key management daemons to
select an encryption algorithm for the security association. 
The default value is 3des.
.It Li ip.ipsec-auth-alg
This is the default authentication algorithm the kernel will instruct
key management daemons to negotiate when establishing security
associations on behalf of the kernel.  
Such security associations can occur as a result of a process having
requested some security level through
.Xr setsockopt 3 ,
or as a result of dynamic
.Xr vpn 8
entries.
Supported values are hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, and hmac-ripemd160.
If set to any other value, it is left to the key management daemons to
select an authentiction algorithm for the security association. 
The default value is hmac-sha1.
.It Li ip4.allow
If set to 0, incoming IPv4-in-IPv4 packets will not be processed.
If set to any other value, processing will occur.

If set to 0, incoming GRE packets will not be processed.
If set to any other value, processing will occur.
.It Li mobileip.allow
If set to 0, incoming MobileIP encapsulated packets (RFC 2004) will not be processed.
If set to any other value, processing will occur.
.It Li etherip.allow
If set to 0, incoming Ethernet-in-IPv4 packets will not be processed.
If set to any other value, processing will occur.
.It Li icmp.maskrepl

network mask requests are to be answered.
.It Li tcp.rfc1323
Returns 1 if RFC1323 extensions to
.Tn TCP
are enabled.
.It Li tcp.baddynamic
An array of
.Li in_port_t
is returned specifying the bitmask of
.Tn TCP
ports between 512
and 1023 inclusive that should not be allocated dynamically
by the kernel (i.e., they must be bound specifically by port number).
.It Li tcp.ident
A structure
.Li struct tcp_ident_mapping
specifying a local and foreign endpoint of a
.Tn TCP
socket is filled in with the euid and ruid of the process that owns the socket.
If no such socket exists then the euid and ruid values are both
set to -1.
.It Li tcp.keepidle
If the socket option 
.Pa SO_KEEPALIVE 
has been set, time a connection needs to be idle before keepalives are sent.
See also tcp.slowhz.
.It Li tcp.keepintvl
Time after a keepalive probe is sent until, in the absence of any response,
another probe is sent.
See also tcp.slowhz.
.It Li tcp.slowhz
The units for tcp.keepidle and tcp.keepintvl; those variables are in ticks

The variables are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "123456"
.It Li ip6.forwarding
Returns 1 when IPv6 forwarding is enabled for the node,
meaning that the node is acting as a router.
Returns 0 when IPv6 forwarding is disabled for the node,
meaning that the node is acting as a host.
IPv6 specification defines node behavior for
.Dq router
case and
.Dq host
case quite differently, and changing this variable during operation
may cause serious trouble.
It is recommended to configure the variable at bootstrap time,
and bootstrap time only.
.It Li ip6.redirect
Returns 1 when ICMPv6 redirects may be sent by the node.
This option is ignored unless the node is routing IP packets,
and should normally be enabled on all systems.
.It Li ip6.hlim
The default hop limit value for an IPv6 unicast packet sourced by the node.
This value applies to all the transport protocols on top of IPv6.
There are APIs to override the value, as documented in
.Xr ip6 4 .
.It Li ip6.maxfragpackets
The maximum number of fragmented packets the node will accept.
0 means that the node will not accept any fragmented packets.
-1 means that the node will accept as many fragmented packets as it receives.
The flag is provided basically for avoiding possible DoS attacks.
.It Li ip6.accept_rtadv
If set to non-zero, the node will accept ICMPv6 router advertisement packets
and autoconfigures address prefixes and default routers.
The node must be a host
.Pq not a router
for the option to be meaningful.
.It Li ip6.keepfaith
If set to non-zero, it enables
.Dq FAITH
TCP relay IPv6-to-IPv4 translator code in the kernel.
Refer
.Xr faith 4
and
.Xr faithd 8
for detail.
.It Li ip6.log_interval
The variable controls amount of logs generated by IPv6 packet
forwarding engine, by seting interval between log output
.Pq in seconds .
.It Li ip6.hdrnestlimit
The number of IPv6 extension headers permitted on incoming IPv6 packets.
If set to 0, the node will accept as many extension headers as possible.
.It Li ip6.dad_count
The variable cofigures number of IPv6 DAD
.Pq duplicated address detection
probe packets.
The packets will be generated when IPv6 interface addresses are configured.
.It Li ip6.auto_flowlabel
On connected transport protocol packets,
fill IPv6 flowlabel field to help intermediate routers to identify packet flows.
.It Li ip6.defmcasthlim
The default hop limit value for an IPv6 multicast packet sourced by the node.
This value applies to all the transport protocols on top of IPv6.
There are APIs to override the value, as documented in
.Xr ip6 4 .
.It Li ip6.gif_hlim
The maximum hop limit value for an IPv6 packet generated by
.Xr gif 4
tunnel interface.
.It Li ip6.kame_version
The string identifies the version of KAME IPv6 stack implemented in the kernel.
.It Li ip6.use_deprecated
The variable controls use of deprecated address, specified in RFC2462 5.5.4.
.It Li ip6.rr_prune
The variable specifies interval between IPv6 router renumbering prefix
babysitting, in seconds.
.It Li icmp6.rediraccept
If set to non-zero, the host will accept ICMPv6 redirect packets.
Note that IPv6 routers will never accept ICMPv6 redirect packets,
and the variable is meaningful on IPv6 hosts
.Pq non-router
only.
.It Li icmp6.redirtimeout
The variable specifies lifetime of routing entries generated by incoming
ICMPv6 redirect.
.It Li icmp6.errratelimit
The variable specifies minimum interval between ICMPv6 error messages,
in microseconds.
.It Li icmp6.nd6_prune
The variable specifies interval between IPv6 neighbor cache babysitting,
in seconds.
.It Li icmp6.nd6_delay
The variable specifies
.Dv DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME
timing constant in IPv6 neighbor discovery specification
.Pq RFC2461 ,
in seconds.
.It Li icmp6.nd6_umaxtries
The variable specifies
.Dv MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT
constant in IPv6 neighbor discovery specification
.Pq RFC2461 .
.It Li icmp6.nd6_mmaxtries
The variable specifies
.Dv MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT
constant in IPv6 neighbor discovery specification
.Pq RFC2461 .
.It Li icmp6.nd6_useloopback
If set to non-zero, kernel IPv6 stack will use loopback interface for
local traffic.
.It Li icmp6.nd6_proxyall
The variable enables proxy neighbor advertisements.
.It Li icmp6.nodeinfo
The variable enables, or disables, kernel support for
ICMPv6 node information query/reply.
