.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn signal
and
.Fn bsd_signal
facilities are simplified interfaces to the more general
.Xr sigaction 2
facility.
The
.Fn bsd_signal
interface is provided for source compatibility only.
It is mainly used on systems where the standard
.Fn signal
does not have
.Bx
semantics.
On
.Ox
the two interfaces are identical.
.Pp
Signals allow the manipulation of a process from outside its
domain as well as allowing the process to manipulate itself or
copies of itself (children).
There are two general types of signals:
those that cause termination of a process and those that do not.
Signals which cause termination of a program might result from
an irrecoverable error or might be the result of a user at a terminal
typing the
.Dq interrupt
character.
.Pp
Signals are used when a process is stopped because it wishes to access
its control terminal while in the background (see
.Xr tty 4 ) .
Signals are optionally generated
when a process resumes after being stopped,
when the status of child processes changes,
or when input is ready at the control terminal.
Most signals result in the termination of the process receiving them
if no action
is taken; some signals instead cause the process receiving them
to be stopped, or are simply discarded if the process has not
requested otherwise.
.Pp
Except for the
.Dv SIGKILL
and
.Dv SIGSTOP
signals, the
.Fn signal
function allows for any signal to be caught, to be ignored, or to generate
an interrupt.
These signals are defined in the file
.Aq Pa signal.h :
.Bl -column SIGVTALA "create core imag"

.El
.Pp
The
.Fa func
argument is a function to be called as the action upon receipt of the signal
.Fa sigcatch .
The function will be called with one argument,
.Fa sigraised ,
which is the signal raised (thus the same function,
.Fa func ,
can be used by more than one signal).
To set the default action of the signal to occur as listed above,
.Fa func
should be
.Dv SIG_DFL .
A
.Dv SIG_DFL
resets the default action.
To ignore the signal,
.Fa func
should be
.Dv SIG_IGN .
This will cause subsequent instances of the signal to be ignored
and pending instances to be discarded.
If
.Dv SIG_IGN
is not used,
further occurrences of the signal are
automatically blocked and
.Fa func
is called.
.Pp
If the
.Fa func
is set to
.Dv SIG_IGN
for the
.Dv SIGCHLD
signal, the system will not create zombie processes when children of
the calling process exit.
If the calling process subsequently issues a
.Xr wait 2
(or equivalent), it blocks until all of the calling process's child
processes terminate, and then returns a value of \-1 with
.Va errno
set to
.Dv ECHILD .
.Bf -symbolic
This differs from historical
.Bx
behavior but is consistent with
.At V
as well as the
.St -xpg4.2 .
.Ef
.Pp
The handled signal is unblocked when
.Fa func
returns and
the process continues from where it left off when the signal occurred.
.Bf -symbolic
Unlike previous signal facilities, the handler
func() remains installed after a signal has been delivered.
.Ef
.Pp
For some system calls, if a signal is caught while the call is
executing and the call is prematurely terminated,
the call is automatically restarted.
(The handler is installed using the
.Dv SA_RESTART
flag with
.Xr sigaction 2 . )
The affected system calls include
.Xr read 2 ,
.Xr write 2 ,
.Xr sendto 2 ,
.Xr recvfrom 2 ,
.Xr sendmsg 2 ,
and
.Xr recvmsg 2
on a communications channel or a low-speed device
and during a
.Xr ioctl 2
or
.Xr wait 2 .
However, calls that have already committed are not restarted,
but instead return a partial success (for example, a short read count).
The
.Xr siginterrupt 3
function can be used to change the system call restart behavior for
a specific signal.
.Pp
When a process which has installed signal handlers forks,
the child process inherits the signals.
All caught signals may be reset to their default action by a call
to the
.Xr execve 2
function;
ignored signals remain ignored.
.Pp
The following functions are either reentrant or not interruptible
by signals and are async-signal safe.
Therefore applications may
invoke them, without restriction, from signal-catching functions:

.Pp
In addition, access and updates to
.Va errno
are guaranteed to be safe.
Most functions not in the above lists are considered to be unsafe
with respect to signals.
That is to say, the behaviour of such functions when called from
a signal handler is undefined.
In general though, signal handlers should do little more than set a
flag, ideally of type volatile sig_atomic_t; most other actions are not safe.
.Pp
Additionally, it is advised that signal handlers guard against
modification of the external symbol
.Va errno
by the above functions, saving it at entry and restoring
it on return, thus:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
handler(int sig)
{
	int save_errno = errno;

	...
	errno = save_errno;
}
.Ed
.Pp
The functions below are async-signal-safe in
.Ox
except when used with floating-point arguments or directives,
but are probably unsafe on other systems:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -compact -width foofoofoofoo
.It Fn snprintf
Safe.
.It Fn vsnprintf
Safe.
.It Fn syslog_r
Safe if the
.Va syslog_data
struct is initialized as a local variable.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The previous action is returned on a successful call.
Otherwise,
.Dv SIG_ERR
is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn signal
will fail and no action will take place if one of the
following occurs:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
A specified signal
is not a valid signal number.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An attempt is made to ignore or supply a handler for
.Dv SIGKILL
or
.Dv SIGSTOP .
