.Sh NAME
.Nm basename ,
.Nm dirname
.Nd extract the base or directory portition of a pathname
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <libgen.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn basename "char *path"
.Ft char *
.Fn dirname "char *path"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn basename
function
returns the last componenent from the pathname pointed to by
.Ar path ,
deleting any trailing '/' characters.  If
.Ar path
consists entirely of '/' characters, a pointer to the string "/"
is returned.  If
.Ar path
is a NULL pointer or the empty string, a pointer to the string "."
is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn dirname
function
is the converse of
.Fn basename ;
it returns a pointer to the parent directory of the pathname pointed to by
.Ar path .
Any trailing '/' characters are not counted as part of the directory
name.  If
.Ar path
is a NULL pointer, the empty string, or contains no '/' characters,
.Fn dirname
returns a pointer to the string ".", signifying the current directory.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful completion,
.Fn basename
returns a pointer to the last component of
.Ar path.
.Pp
On successful completion,
.Fn dirname
returns a pointer to the parent directory of
.Ar path.
.Pp
If
.Fn basename
or
.Fn dirname
fail, a NULL pointer is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The following error codes may be set in
.Va errno :
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
the path component to be returned was larger than
.Va MANPATHLEN .
.Sh WARNINGS
Both
.Fn basename
and
.Fn dirname
return pointers to internal static storage space that will be overwritten
by subsequent calls (each function has its own separate storage).
