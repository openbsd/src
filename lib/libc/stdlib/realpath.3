.Dt REALPATH 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm realpath
.Nd returns the canonicalized absolute pathname
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <limits.h>
.Fd #include <stdlib.h>
.Ft "char *"
.Fn realpath "const char *pathname" "char resolved[PATH_MAX]"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn realpath
function resolves all symbolic links, extra
.Dq /
characters and references to
.Pa /./
and
.Pa /../
in
.Fa pathname ,
and copies the resulting absolute pathname into the memory referenced by
.Fa resolved .
The
.Fa resolved
argument
.Em must
refer to a buffer capable of storing at least
.Dv PATH_MAX
characters.
.Pp
The
.Fn realpath
function will resolve both absolute and relative paths
and return the absolute pathname corresponding to
.Fa pathname .
All but the last component of
.Fa pathname
must exist when
.Fn realpath
is called.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn realpath
function returns
.Fa resolved
on success.
If an error occurs,
.Fn realpath
returns
.Dv NULL
and the contents of
.Fa resolved
are undefined.
.Sh ERRORS
The function
.Fn realpath
may fail and set the external variable
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library functions
.Xr lstat 2 ,
.Xr readlink 2 ,
and
.Xr getcwd 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr readlink 1 ,
.Xr getcwd 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn realpath
function call first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh CAVEATS
This implementation of
.Fn realpath
differs slightly from the Solaris implementation.
The
.Bx 4.4
version always returns absolute pathnames,
whereas the Solaris implementation will,
under certain circumstances, return a relative
.Fa resolved
when given a relative
.Fa pathname .
