.Dt GETOPT_LONG 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getopt_long ,
.Nm getopt_long_only
.Nd get long options from command line argument list
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <getopt.h>
.Vt extern char *optarg;
.Vt extern int   optind;
.Vt extern int   optopt;
.Vt extern int   opterr;
.Vt extern int   optreset;
.Ft int
.Fn getopt_long "int argc" "char * const *argv" "const char *optstring" "const struct option *longopts" "int *index"
.Ft int
.Fn getopt_long_only "int argc" "char * const *argv" "const char *optstring" "const struct option *longopts" "int *index"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getopt_long
function is similar to
.Xr getopt 3
but it accepts options in two forms: words and characters.
The
.Fn getopt_long
function provides a superset of the functionality of
.Xr getopt 3 .
.Fn getopt_long
can be used in two ways.
In the first way, every long option understood by the program has a
corresponding short option, and the option structure is only used to
translate from long options to short options.
When used in this fashion,
.Fn getopt_long
behaves identically to
.Xr getopt 3 .
This is a good way to add long option processing to an existing program
with the minimum of rewriting.
.Pp
In the second mechanism, a long option sets a flag in the
.Fa option
structure passed, or will store a pointer to the command line argument
in the
.Fa option
structure passed to it for options that take arguments.
Additionally, the long option's argument may be specified as a single
argument with an equal sign, e.g.
.Bd -literal
myprogram --myoption=somevalue
.Ed
.Pp
When a long option is processed the call to
.Fn getopt_long
will return 0.
For this reason, long option processing without
shortcuts is not backwards compatible with
.Xr getopt 3 .
.Pp
It is possible to combine these methods, providing for long options
processing with short option equivalents for some options.
Less frequently used options would be processed as long options only.
.Pp
The
.Fn getopt_long
call requires a structure to be initialized describing the long
options.
The structure is:
.Bd -literal
struct option {
	char *name;
	int has_arg;
	int *flag;
	int val;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa name
field should contain the option name without the leading double dash.
.Pp
The
.Fa has_arg
field should be one of:
.Bl -tag -width "optional_argument"
.It Li no_argument
no argument to the option is expect.
.It Li required_argument
an argument to the option is required.
.It Li optional_argument
an argument to the option may be presented.
.El
.Pp
If
.Fa flag
is not
.Dv NULL ,
then the integer pointed to by it will be set to the value in the
.Fa val
field.
If the
.Fa flag
field is
.Dv NULL ,
then the
.Fa val
field will be returned.
Setting
.Fa flag
to
.Dv NULL
and setting
.Fa val
to the corresponding short option will make this function act just
like
.Xr getopt 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn getopt_long_only
function behaves identically to
.Fn getopt_long
with the exception that long options may start with
.Sq -
in addition to
.Sq -- .
If an option starting with
.Sq -
does not match a long option but does match a single-character option,
the single-character option is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the
.Fa flag
field in
.Li struct option
is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn getopt_long
and
.Fn getopt_long_only
return the value specified in the
.Fa val
field, which is usually just the corresponding short option.
If
.Fa flag
is not
.Dv NULL ,
these functions return 0 and store
.Fa val
in the location pointed to by
.Fa flag .
These functions return
.Sq \:
if there was a missing option argument,
.Sq ?
if the user specified an unknown or ambiguous option, and
\-1 when the argument list has been exhausted.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -compact
int bflag, ch, fd;
int daggerset;

/* options descriptor */
static struct option longopts[] = {
	{ "buffy",	no_argument,		0, 		'b' },
	{ "fluoride",	required_argument,	0, 	       	'f' },
	{ "daggerset",	no_argument,		&daggerset,	1 },
	{ 0, 		0,			0, 		0 }
};

bflag = 0;
while ((ch = getopt_long(argc, argv, "bf:", longopts, NULL)) != -1)
	switch(ch) {
	case 'b':
		bflag = 1;
		break;
	case 'f':
		if ((fd = open(optarg, O_RDONLY, 0)) == -1)
			err(1, "unable to open %s", optarg);
		break;
	case 0:
		if (daggerset) {
			fprintf(stderr,"Buffy will use her dagger to "
				       "apply fluoride to dracula's teeth\en");
		}
		break;
	case '?':
	default:
		usage();
}
argc -= optind;
argv += optind;

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION DIFFERENCES
This section describes differences to the GNU implementation
found in glibc-2.1.3:
.Bl -tag -width "xxx"
.It Li o
handling of - as first char of option string in presence of
environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT:
.Bl -tag -width "OpenBSD"
.It Li GNU
ignores POSIXLY_CORRECT and returns non-options as
arguments to option '\e1'.
.It Li OpenBSD
honors POSIXLY_CORRECT and stops at the first non-option.
.El
.It Li o
handling of - within the option string (not the first character).
.Bl -tag -width "OpenBSD"
.It Li GNU
treats a
.Ql -
on the command line as a non-argument.
.It Li OpenBSD
a
.Ql -
within the option string matches a
.Ql -
(single dash) on the command line.
This functionality is provided for backward compatibility with
programs, such as
.Xr su 1 ,
that use
.Ql -
as an option flag.
This practice is wrong, and should not be used in any current development.
.El
.It Li o
handling of :: in options string in presence of POSIXLY_CORRECT:
.Bl -tag -width "OpenBSD"
.It Li Both
GNU and OpenBSD ignore POSIXLY_CORRECT here and take :: to
mean the preceding option takes an optional argument.
.El
.It Li o
return value in case of missing argument if first character
(after + or -) in option string is not ':':
.Bl -tag -width "OpenBSD"
.It Li GNU
returns '?'
.It OpenBSD
returns ':' (since OpenBSD's getopt does).
.El
.It Li o
handling of --a in getopt:
.Bl -tag -width "OpenBSD"
.It Li GNU
parses this as option '-', option 'a'.
.It Li OpenBSD
parses this as '--', and returns -1 (ignoring the a).  (Because
the original getopt does.)
.El
.It Li o
setting of optopt for long options with flag !=
.Dv NULL :
.Bl -tag -width "OpenBSD"
.It Li GNU
sets optopt to val.
.It Li OpenBSD
sets optopt to 0 (since val would never be returned).
.El
.It Li o
handling of -W with W; in option string in getopt (not getopt_long):
.Bl -tag -width "OpenBSD"
.It Li GNU
causes a segfault.
.It Li OpenBSD
no special handling is done;
.Dq W;
is interpreted as two separate options, neither of which take an argument.
.El
.It Li o
setting of optarg for long options without an argument that are
invoked via -W (W; in option string):
.Bl -tag -width "OpenBSD"
.It Li GNU
sets optarg to the option name (the argument of -W).
.It Li OpenBSD
sets optarg to
.Dv NULL
(the argument of the long option).
.El
.It Li o
handling of -W with an argument that is not (a prefix to) a known
long option (W; in option string):
.Bl -tag -width "OpenBSD"
.It Li GNU
returns -W with optarg set to the unknown option.
.It Li OpenBSD
treats this as an error (unknown option) and returns '?' with
optopt set to 0 and optarg set to
.Dv NULL
(as GNU's man page documents).
.El
.It Li o
The error messages are different.
.It Li o
OpenBSD does not permute the argument vector at the same points in
the calling sequence as GNU does.
The aspects normally used by the caller
(ordering after \-1 is returned, value of optind relative
to current positions) are the same, though.
(We do fewer variable swaps.)
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width POSIXLY_CORRECT
.It Ev POSIXLY_CORRECT
If set, option processing stops when the first non-option is found and
a leading
.Sq -
or
.Sq +
in the
.Ar optstring
is ignored.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getopt 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getopt_long
and
.Fn getopt_long_only
functions first appeared in GNU libiberty.
This implementation first appeared in
.Ox 3.3 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Ar argv
argument is not really
.Dv const
as its elements may be permuted (unless
.Ev POSIXLY_CORRECT
is set).
.Pp
In a future release, this implementation should completely replace
.Xr getopt 3 .
