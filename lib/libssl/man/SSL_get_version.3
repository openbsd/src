.Nd get the protocol version of a connection
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/ssl.h
.Ft const char *
.Fn SSL_get_version "const SSL *ssl"
.Ft int
.Fn SSL_version "const SSL *ssl"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_get_version
returns the name of the protocol used for the connection
.Fa ssl .
.Pp
.Fn SSL_version
returns an integer constant representing that protocol.

These functions only return reliable results
after the initial handshake has been completed.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The following strings or integers can be returned:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Qo TLSv1 Qc No or Dv TLS1_VERSION
