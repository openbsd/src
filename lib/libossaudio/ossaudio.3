.Dt OSSAUDIO 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ossaudio
.Nd OSS audio emulation
.Sh LIBRARY
.Nm -lossaudio
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <soundcard.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides an emulation of the OSS (Linux) audio
interface.
.Pp
Use the native interface for new programs and the emulation
library only for porting programs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
library first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Sh BUGS
The emulation uses a #define for
.Fn ioctl
so some obscure programs
can fail to compile.
.Pp
The emulation is incomplete.
.Pp
The emulation only covers
.Fn ioctl ,
there are other differences as well.
E.g., on a write that would block in non-blocking mode Linux returns
.Dv EINTR
whereas
.Ox
returns
.Dv EAGAIN .
