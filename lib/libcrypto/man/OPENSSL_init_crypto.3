.Dt OPENSSL_INIT_CRYPTO 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm OPENSSL_init_crypto
.Nd initialise the crypto library
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/crypto.h
.Ft int
.Fo OPENSSL_init_crypto
.Fa "uint64_t options"
.Fa "const void *dummy"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function is deprecated.
It is never useful for any application program to call it explicitly.
The library automatically calls it internally with an
.Fa options
argument of 0 whenever needed.
It is safest to assume that any function may do so.
.Pp
To enable or disable the standard configuration file, instead use
.Xr OPENSSL_config 3
or
.Xr OPENSSL_no_config 3 ,
respectively.
To load a non-standard configuration file, refer to
.Xr CONF_modules_load_file 3 .
.Pp
If
.Fn OPENSSL_init_crypto
is called before any other crypto or ssl functions, the crypto
library is initialised by allocating various internal resources,
in particular calling
.Xr ERR_load_crypto_strings 3 ,
.Xr OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers 3 ,
and
.Xr OpenSSL_add_all_digests 3 .
.Pp
The following
.Fa options
are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv OPENSSL_INIT_LOAD_CONFIG
At the end of the initialization, call
.Xr OPENSSL_config 3
with a
.Dv NULL
argument, loading the default configuration file.
.It Dv OPENSSL_INIT_NO_LOAD_CONFIG
Ignore any later calls to
.Xr OPENSSL_config 3 .
.El
.Pp
The other
.Fa options
flags defined by OpenSSL are all ignored by LibreSSL.
The
.Fa dummy
argument has no effect.
.Pp
If this function is called more than once, none of the calls except
the first one have any effect.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn OPENSSL_init_crypto
is intended to return 1 on success or 0 on error.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr CONF_modules_load_file 3 ,
.Xr OPENSSL_config 3 ,
.Xr OPENSSL_load_builtin_modules 3 ,
.Xr openssl.cnf 5
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn OPENSSL_init_crypto
first appeared in OpenSSL 1.1.0 and has been available since
.Ox 6.3 .
.Sh BUGS
.Fn OPENSSL_init_crypto
silently ignores almost all kinds of errors.
In particular, if memory allocation fails, initialisation is likely
to remain incomplete, the library may be in an inconsistent internal
state, but the return value will usually indicate success anyway.
There is no way for the application program to find out whether
library initialisation is actually complete, nor to get back to a
consistent state if it isn't.
