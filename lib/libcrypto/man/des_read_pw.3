.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are deprecated.
Use
.Xr UI_UTIL_read_pw 3
instead.
.Pp
The DES library contained a few routines to prompt for passwords.
These aren't necessarily dependent on DES, and have therefore become
part of the UI compatibility library.
.Pp
.Fn des_read_pw
writes the string specified by
.Fa prompt
to standard output, turns echo off, and reads an input string from the
terminal.
The string is returned in
.Fa buf ,
which must have space for at least
.Fa length
bytes.
If
.Fa verify
is set, the user is asked for the password twice and unless the two
copies match, an error is returned.
The second password is stored in
.Fa buff ,
which must therefore also be at least
.Fa length
bytes.
.Pp
.Fn des_read_pw_string
is a variant of
.Fn des_read_pw
that provides a buffer if
.Fa verify
is set.
It is available in the MIT Kerberos library as well.
If
.Fa length
exceeds
.Dv BUFSIZ ,
.Fn des_read_pw_string
uses
.Dv BUFSIZ .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_read_pw_string
and
.Fn EVP_read_pw_string_min
are functionally similar to
.Fn des_read_pw_string .
.Fn EVP_read_pw_string_min
additionally checks that the password is at least
.Fa min_length
bytes long.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return 0 on success and a negative value on failure.
.Pp
They return -1 if
.Fa length
is less than or equal to zero or on memory allocation failure.
They return -1 or -2 if the internal call to
.Xr UI_process 3
fails.
.Pp
In addition,
.Fa EVP_read_pw_string_min
returns -1 if
.Fa min_length
is negative, if
.Fa length
is less than or equal to
.Fa min_length ,
or if the user entered a password shorter than
.Fa min_length .
