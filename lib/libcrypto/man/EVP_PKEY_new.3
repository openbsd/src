.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure is used by various OpenSSL functions which require a general
private key without reference to any particular algorithm.
.Pp
The
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new
function allocates an empty
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure.
The reference count is set to 1.
To add a private or public key to it, use the functions described in
.Xr EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA 3 .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_up_ref
increments the reference count of
.Fa key
by 1.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_free
decrements the reference count of
.Fa key
by 1, and if the reference count reaches zero, frees it up.
If
.Fa key
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new_mac_key
allocates a new
.Vt EVP_PKEY .
If
.Fa e
is
.Pf non- Dv NULL ,
then the new
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure is associated with the engine
.Fa e .
The
.Fa type
argument indicates what kind of key this is.
The value should be a NID for a public key algorithm that supports
raw private keys, for example
.Dv EVP_PKEY_HMAC .
.Fa key
points to the raw private key data for this
.Vt EVP_PKEY
which should be of length
.Fa keylen .
The length should be appropriate for the type of the key.
The public key data will be automatically derived from the given
private key data (if appropriate for the algorithm type).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new
and
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new_mac_key
return either the newly allocated
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_up_ref
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
