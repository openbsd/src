.Sh NAME
.Nm EVP_PKEY_new ,
.Nm EVP_PKEY_up_ref ,
.Nm EVP_PKEY_free
.Nd private key allocation functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/evp.h
.Ft EVP_PKEY *
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new void
.Ft int
.Fo EVP_PKEY_up_ref
.Fa "EVP_PKEY *key"
.Fc
.Ft void
.Fo EVP_PKEY_free
.Fa "EVP_PKEY *key"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure is used by various OpenSSL functions which require a general
private key without reference to any particular algorithm.
.Pp
The
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new
function allocates an empty
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure.
The reference count is set to 1.
To add a private key to it, use the functions described in
.Xr EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA 3 .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_up_ref
increments the reference count of
.Fa key
by 1.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_free
decrements the reference count of
.Fa key
by 1, and if the reference count reaches zero, frees it up.
If
.Fa key
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new
returns either the newly allocated
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_up_ref
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.

.Sh HISTORY
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new
and
.Fn EVP_PKEY_free
first appeared in SSLeay 0.6.0 and have been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_up_ref
first appeared in OpenSSL 1.1.0 and has been available since
