.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn DH_generate_parameters_ex
generates Diffie-Hellman parameters that can be shared among a group of
users, and stores them in the provided
.Vt DH
structure.
.Pp
.Fa prime_len
is the length in bits of the safe prime to be generated.
.Fa generator
is a small number > 1, typically 2 or 5.
.Pp
A callback function may be used to provide feedback about the progress
of the key generation.
If
.Fa cb
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it will be called as described in
.Xr BN_generate_prime 3
while a random prime number is generated, and when a prime has been
found,
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 3 0
is called; see
.Xr BN_GENCB_call 3 .
.Pp
.Fn DH_check
validates Diffie-Hellman parameters.
If no problems are found,
.Pf * Ar codes
is set to zero.
Otherwise, one or more of the following bits are set:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv DH_CHECK_P_NOT_PRIME
The parameter
.Fa dh->p
is not prime.
.It Dv DH_CHECK_P_NOT_SAFE_PRIME
The parameter
.Fa dh->p
is not a safe prime.
.It Dv DH_UNABLE_TO_CHECK_GENERATOR
The generator
.Fa dh->g
cannot be checked for suitability: it is neither 2 nor 5.
.It Dv DH_NOT_SUITABLE_GENERATOR
The generator
.Fa dh->g
is not suitable.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn DH_generate_parameters_ex
and
.Fn DH_check
return 1 if the check could be performed, or 0 otherwise.
.Pp
.Fn DH_generate_parameters
(deprecated) returns a pointer to the
.Vt DH
structure, or
.Dv NULL
if the parameter generation fails.
.Pp
The error codes can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr DH_get0_pqg 3 ,
.Xr DH_new 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn DH_check
and
.Fn DH_generate_parameters
first appeared in SSLeay 0.5.1 and have been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Pp
The
.Fa cb_arg
argument to
.Fn DH_generate_parameters
was added in SSLeay 0.9.0.
.Pp
In versions before OpenSSL 0.9.5,
.Dv DH_CHECK_P_NOT_STRONG_PRIME
is used instead of
.Dv DH_CHECK_P_NOT_SAFE_PRIME .
.Pp
.Fn DH_generate_parameters_ex
first appeared in OpenSSL 0.9.8 and has been available since
.Ox 4.5 .
.Sh CAVEATS
.Fn DH_generate_parameters_ex
and
.Fn DH_generate_parameters
may run for several hours before finding a suitable prime.
.Pp
The parameters generated by
.Fn DH_generate_parameters_ex
and
.Fn DH_generate_parameters
are not to be used in signature schemes.
.Sh BUGS
If
.Fa generator
is not 2 or 5,
.Fa dh->g Ns = Ns Fa generator
is not a usable generator.
