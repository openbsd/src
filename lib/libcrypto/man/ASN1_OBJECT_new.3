.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ASN1_OBJECT_new ,
.Nm ASN1_OBJECT_free
.Nd ASN.1 object identifiers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/asn1.h
.Ft ASN1_OBJECT *
.Fo ASN1_OBJECT_new
.Fa void
.Fc
.Ft void
.Fo ASN1_OBJECT_free
.Fa "ASN1_OBJECT *a"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt ASN1_OBJECT
object, representing an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER.
It can hold a short name, a long name, a numeric identifier (NID),
and a sequence of integers identifying a node in the International
Object Identifier tree as specified in ITU-T recommendation X.660.
The new object is marked as dynamically allocated.
.Pp
Application programs normally use utility functions like
.Xr OBJ_nid2obj 3
rather than using
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_new
directly.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_free
has the following effects:
.Pp
All data contained in
.Fa a
that is marked as dynamically allocated is freed,
and the respective fields of
.Fa a
become empty.
Contained data not marked as dynamically allocated remains intact.
.Pp
If the object
.Fa a
itself is marked as dynamically allocated, it is freed.
Otherwise, the pointer
.Fa a
remains valid.
.Pp
If
.Fa a
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer or if neither the object itself nor any of its content
is marked as dynamically allocated, no action occurs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the allocation fails,
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_new
returns
.Dv NULL
and sets an error code that can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the new object.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr d2i_ASN1_OBJECT 3 ,
.Xr OBJ_nid2obj 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_new
and
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_free
appeared in SSLeay 0.8.1b or earlier and have been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
