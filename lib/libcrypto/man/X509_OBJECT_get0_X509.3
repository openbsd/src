.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Vt X509_OBJECT
structure is a shallow wrapper around one
.Vt X509
certificate object, one
.Vt X509_CRL
certificate revocation list object, one
.Vt EVP_PKEY
private key object, or one
.Vt char *
string.
It also remembers which type of object it contains at any given time.
.Pp
Each
.Vt X509_STORE
object uses one stack of
.Vt X509_OBJECT
structures as its main storage area.
.Pp
If
.Fa obj
contains an
.Vt X509
certificate or an
.Vt X509_CRL
certificate revocation list,
.Fn X509_OBJECT_up_ref_count
increments the reference count of that inner object by 1.
Otherwise, no action occurs.
.Pp
If
.Fa obj
contains an
.Vt X509
certificate,
.Fn X509_OBJECT_free_contents
calls
.Xr X509_free 3
on that inner object.
If
.Fa obj
contains an
.Vt X509_CRL
certificate revocation list, it calls
.Xr X509_CRL_free 3
on that inner list.
Otherwise, no action occurs.
.Fn X509_OBJECT_free_contents
does not free
.Fa obj
itself.
.Pp
If
.Fa type
is
.Dv X509_LU_X509 ,
.Fn X509_OBJECT_idx_by_subject
and
.Fn X509_OBJECT_retrieve_by_subject
search the given
.Fa stack
for a certificate with the subject
.Fa name .
If
.Fa type
is
.Dv X509_LU_CRL ,
they search for a certificate revocation list with the issuer
.Fa name
instead.
.Pp
If
.Fa obj
contains a certificate,
.Fn X509_OBJECT_retrieve_match
searches the given
.Fa stack
for a certificate with a matching subject name;
if it contains a certificate revocation list, it searches for a
certificate revocation list with a matching issuer name instead;
otherwise, it searches for an
.Vt X509_OBJECT
with a matching type.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_OBJECT_get0_X509
returns an internal pointer to the certificate contained in
.Fa obj
or
.Dv NULL
if
.Fa obj
is
.Dv NULL
or contains no certificate.
.Pp
.Fn X509_OBJECT_get0_X509_CRL
returns an internal pointer to the certificate revocation list contained in
.Fa obj
or
.Dv NULL
if
.Fa obj
is
.Dv NULL
or contains no certificate revocation list.
.Pp
.Fn X509_OBJECT_idx_by_subject
returns the zero-based index of the first matching certificate
or revocation list in the
.Fa stack
or \-1 if
.Fa type
is neither
.Dv X509_LU_X509
nor
.Dv X509_LU_CRL
or if no match is found.
.Pp
.Fn X509_OBJECT_retrieve_by_subject
returns the first matching certificate or revocation list in the
.Fa stack
or
.Dv NULL
if
.Fa type
is neither
.Dv X509_LU_X509
nor
.Dv X509_LU_CRL
or if no match is found.
.Pp
.Fn X509_OBJECT_retrieve_match
returns the first mathching
.Vt X509_OBJECT
or
.Dv NULL
if
.Fa stack
or
.Fa obj
is
.Dv NULL
or no match is found.
