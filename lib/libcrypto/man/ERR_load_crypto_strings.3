.Dt ERR_LOAD_CRYPTO_STRINGS 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ERR_load_crypto_strings ,
.Nm ERR_free_strings ,
.Nm SSL_load_error_strings
.Nd load and free OpenSSL error strings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/err.h
.Ft void
.Fn ERR_load_crypto_strings void
.Ft void
.Fn ERR_free_strings void
.In openssl/ssl.h
.Ft void
.Fn SSL_load_error_strings void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are deprecated.
It is never useful for any application program to call any of them explicitly.
The library automatically calls them internally whenever needed.
.Pp
.Fn ERR_load_crypto_strings
registers the error strings for all
.Xr crypto 3
functions.
.Fn SSL_load_error_strings
does the same, but also registers the
.Xr ssl 3
error strings.
.Pp
If the error strings were already loaded before, no action occurs.
.Pp
.Fn ERR_free_strings
frees all previously loaded error strings.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ERR 3 ,
.Xr ERR_error_string 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn ERR_load_crypto_strings
and
.Fn SSL_load_error_strings
first appeared in SSLeay 0.4.4.
.Fn ERR_free_strings
first appeared in SSLeay 0.5.1.
These functions been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Sh BUGS
Even though the error strings are already compiled into the object
code of the library as static strings, these functions store them
again using dynamically allocated memory on the heap.
That may fail if insufficient memory is available,
but these functions do not report such errors.
Instead, they fail silently, possibly having registered none or only
a part of the strings requested.
