.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt X509
object with reference count 1.
It represents an ASN.1
.Vt Certificate
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.
It can hold a public key together with information about the person,
organization, device, or function the associated private key belongs to.
.Pp
.Fn X509_free
decrements the reference count of the
.Vt X509
structure
.Fa a
and frees it up if the reference count reaches 0.
If
.Fa a
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Pp
.Fn X509_up_ref
increments the reference count of
.Fa a
by 1.
This function is useful if a certificate structure is being used
by several different operations each of which will free it up after
use: this avoids the need to duplicate the entire certificate
structure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_chain_up_ref
performs a shallow copy of the given
.Fa chain
using
.Fn sk_X509_dup
and increments the reference count of each contained certificate
by 1.
Its purpose is similar to
.Fn X509_up_ref :
The returned chain persists after the original is freed.
.Pp
The object
.Vt X509_INFO ,
which can hold a certificate, the corresponding private key,
and a certificate revocation list, is not yet documented.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the allocation fails,
.Fn X509_new
returns
.Dv NULL
and sets an error code that can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_up_ref
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_chain_up_ref
returns the copy of the
.Fa chain
or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.

.Sh BUGS
The X.509 public key infrastructure and its data types contain too
many design bugs to list them.
