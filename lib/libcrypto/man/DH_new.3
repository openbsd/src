.Dt DH_NEW 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm DH_new ,
.Nm DH_free
.Nd allocate and free DH objects
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/dh.h
.Ft DH*
.Fn DH_new void
.Ft void
.Fo DH_free
.Fa "DH *dh"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The DH functions implement the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol.
.Pp
.Fn DH_new
allocates and initializes a
.Vt DH
structure.
.Pp
.Fn DH_free
frees the
.Vt DH
structure and its components.
The values are erased before the memory is returned to the system.
If
.Fa dh
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the allocation fails,
.Fn DH_new
returns
.Dv NULL
and sets an error code that can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.
