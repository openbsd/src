.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm EVP_PKEY_get_default_digest_nid
.Nd get default signature digest
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/evp.h
.Ft int
.Fo EVP_PKEY_get_default_digest_nid
.Fa "EVP_PKEY *pkey"
.Fa "int *pnid"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn EVP_PKEY_get_default_digest_nid
function sets
.Fa pnid
to the default message digest NID for the public key signature
operations associated with key
.Fa pkey .
.Pp
For all current standard OpenSSL public key algorithms, SHA1 is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn EVP_PKEY_get_default_digest_nid
function returns 1 if the message digest is advisory (that is other
digests can be used) and 2 if it is mandatory (other digests cannot be
used).
It returns 0 or a negative value for failure.
In particular, a return value of -2 indicates the operation is not
supported by the public key algorithm.
