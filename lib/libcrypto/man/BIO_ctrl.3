.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn BIO_ctrl ,
.Fn BIO_callback_ctrl ,
.Fn BIO_ptr_ctrl ,
and
.Fn BIO_int_ctrl
are BIO "control" operations taking arguments of various types.
These functions are not normally called directly -
various macros are used instead.
The standard macros are described below.
Macros specific to a particular type of BIO
are described in the specific BIO's manual page
as well as any special features of the standard calls.
.Pp
Depending on the
.Fa cmd
and on the type of
.Fa b ,
.Fn BIO_ctrl
may have a read-only effect on
.Fa b
or change data in
.Fa b
or in its sub-structures.
It may also have a side effect of changing the memory pointed to by
.Fa parg .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_callback_ctrl
does not call
.Fn BIO_ctrl
but instead requires that the BIO type of
.Fa b
provides a dedicated
.Fa callback_ctrl
function pointer, which is built into the library for some standard BIO
types and can be provided with
.Xr BIO_meth_set_callback_ctrl 3
for application-defined BIO types.
The only
.Fa cmd
supported by
.Fn BIO_callback_ctrl
is
.Dv BIO_CTRL_SET_CALLBACK .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_ptr_ctrl
calls
.Fn BIO_ctrl
with
.Fa parg
pointing to the location of a temporary pointer variable initialized to
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_int_ctrl
calls
.Fn BIO_ctrl
with
.Fa parg
pointing to the location of a temporary
.Vt int
variable initialized to
.Fa iarg .
If
.Fn BIO_ctrl
changes the value stored at
.Pf * Fa parg ,
the new value is ignored.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_reset
typically resets a BIO to some initial state.
In the case of file related BIOs, for example,
it rewinds the file pointer to the start of the file.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_seek
resets a file related BIO's (that is file descriptor and
FILE BIOs) file position pointer to
.Fa ofs
bytes from start of file.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_tell
returns the current file position of a file related BIO.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_flush
normally writes out any internally buffered data.
In some cases it is used to signal EOF and that no more data will be written.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_eof
returns 1 if the BIO has read EOF.
The precise meaning of "EOF" varies according to the BIO type.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_set_close
sets the BIO
.Fa b
close flag to
.Fa flag .
.Fa flag
can take the value
.Dv BIO_CLOSE
or
.Dv BIO_NOCLOSE .
Typically
.Dv BIO_CLOSE
is used in a source/sink BIO to indicate that the underlying I/O stream
should be closed when the BIO is freed.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_get_close
returns the BIO's close flag.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_pending ,
.Fn BIO_ctrl_pending ,
.Fn BIO_wpending ,
and
.Fn BIO_ctrl_wpending
return the number of pending characters in the BIO's read and write buffers.
Not all BIOs support these calls.
.Fn BIO_ctrl_pending
and
.Fn BIO_ctrl_wpending
return a
.Vt size_t
type and are functions.
.Fn BIO_pending
and
.Fn BIO_wpending
are macros which call
.Fn BIO_ctrl .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_set_info_callback
installs the function pointer
.Fa cb
as an info callback in
.Fa b
by calling
.Fn BIO_callback_ctrl
with a command of
.Dv BIO_CTRL_SET_CALLBACK .
Among the BIO types built into the library, only
.Xr BIO_s_connect 3
and
.Xr BIO_f_ssl 3
support this functionality.
Some filter BIO types forward this control call
to the next BIO in the chain instead of processing it themselves.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_get_info_callback
places the function pointer to the info callback into
.Pf * Fa cbp
if any was installed using
.Fn BIO_set_info_callback
or
.Fn BIO_callback_ctrl .
If the type of
.Fa b
supports setting an info callback but none was installed, it stores a
.Dv NULL
pointer in
.Pf * Fa cbp .
.Pp
The function type name
.Vt bio_info_cb
is a deprecated synonym for
.Vt BIO_info_cb
provided for backward compatibility with some existing application software.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The meaning of the return values of
.Fn BIO_ctrl ,
.Fn BIO_callback_ctrl ,
and
.Fn BIO_int_ctrl
depends on both the type of
.Fa b
and on the
.Fa cmd .
If
.Fa b
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs and 0 is returned.
The return value \-2 usually indicates a fatal error.
In particular, it is returned if the
.Fa cmd
is unsupported by the type of
.Fa b .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_callback_ctrl
and
.Fn BIO_set_info_callback
return 1 on success, 0 if
.Fa b
is
.Dv NULL
or to indicate failure of a valid
.Fa cmd ,
or \-2 if the
.Fa cmd
is not supported by
.Fa b .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_ptr_ctrl
returns
.Dv NULL
if the
.Fn BIO_ctrl
call returns a negative value or does not change
.Pf * Fa parg ,
or the pointer it puts into
.Pf * Fa parg
otherwise.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_int_ctrl
returns the return value of
.Fn BIO_ctrl .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_reset
normally returns 1 for success and 0 or -1 for failure.
File BIOs are an exception, returning 0 for success and -1 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_seek
and
.Fn BIO_tell
both return the current file position on success
and -1 for failure, except file BIOs which for
.Fn BIO_seek
always return 0 for success and -1 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_flush
returns 1 for success and 0 or -1 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_eof
returns 1 if EOF has been reached or 0 otherwise.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_set_close
always returns 1.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_get_close
returns the close flag value
.Dv BIO_CLOSE
or
.Dv BIO_NOCLOSE .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_pending ,
.Fn BIO_ctrl_pending ,
.Fn BIO_wpending ,
and
.Fn BIO_ctrl_wpending
return the amount of pending data.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_get_info_callback
returns 1 on success, including when the type of
.Fa b
supports an info callback but none is installed,
0 if
.Fa b
is
.Dv NULL
or \-2 if the type of
.Fa b
does not support an info callback.
.Pp
If a callback was installed in
.Fa b
using
.Xr BIO_set_callback_ex 3
or
.Xr BIO_set_callback 3 ,
it can modify the return values of all these functions.
.Sh NOTES
Because it can write data,
.Fn BIO_flush
may return 0 or -1 indicating that the call should be retried later
in a similar manner to
.Xr BIO_write 3 .
The
.Xr BIO_should_retry 3
call should be used and appropriate action taken if the call fails.
.Pp
The return values of
.Fn BIO_pending
and
.Fn BIO_wpending
may not reliably determine the amount of pending data in all cases.
For example in the case of a file BIO some data may be available in the
.Vt FILE
structure's internal buffers but it is not possible
to determine this in a portable way.
For other types of BIO they may not be supported.
.Pp
If they do not internally handle a particular
.Fn BIO_ctrl
operation, filter BIOs usually pass the operation
to the next BIO in the chain.
This often means there is no need to locate the required BIO for
a particular operation: it can be called on a chain and it will
be automatically passed to the relevant BIO.
However, this can cause unexpected results.
For example no current filter BIOs implement
.Fn BIO_seek ,
but this may still succeed if the chain ends
in a FILE or file descriptor BIO.
.Pp
Source/sink BIOs return a 0 if they do not recognize the
.Fn BIO_ctrl
operation.

.Sh BUGS
Some of the return values are ambiguous and care should be taken.
In particular a return value of 0 can be returned if an operation
is not supported, if an error occurred, if EOF has not been reached
and in the case of
.Fn BIO_seek
on a file BIO for a successful operation.
