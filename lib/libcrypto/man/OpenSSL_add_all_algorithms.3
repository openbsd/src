.Sh NAME

.Nm OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers ,
.Nm OpenSSL_add_all_digests ,
.Nm EVP_cleanup
.Nd add algorithms to internal table
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/evp.h
.Ft void
.Fn OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms void
.Ft void
.Fn OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers void
.Ft void
.Fn OpenSSL_add_all_digests void
.Ft void
.Fn EVP_cleanup void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are deprecated.
It is never useful for any application program
to call any of them explicitly.
The library automatically calls them internally whenever needed.
.Pp
OpenSSL keeps an internal table of digest algorithms and ciphers.
It uses this table to look up ciphers via functions such as
.Xr EVP_get_cipherbyname 3 .
.Pp
.Fn OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms
adds all algorithms to the table (digests and ciphers).
If an application is compiled with the preprocessor symbol
.Dv OPENSSL_LOAD_CONF
#define'd, it also calls
.Xr OPENSSL_config 3
with a
.Dv NULL
argument, loading the default configuration file.
.Pp
.Fn OpenSSL_add_all_digests
adds all digest algorithms to the table.
.Pp
.Fn OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers
adds all encryption algorithms to the table including password based
encryption algorithms.
.Pp
If any of the above functions is called more than once,
only the first call has an effect.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_cleanup
removes all ciphers and digests from the table.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr evp 3 ,
.Xr EVP_DigestInit 3 ,
.Xr EVP_EncryptInit 3 ,
.Xr OPENSSL_config 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn EVP_cleanup
and precursor functions
.Fn SSLeay_add_all_algorithms ,
.Fn SSLeay_add_all_ciphers ,
and
.Fn SSLeay_add_all_digests
first appeared in SSLeay 0.8.0 and have been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Pp
.Fn OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms ,
.Fn OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers ,
and
.Fn OpenSSL_add_all_digests
first appeared in OpenSSL 0.9.5 and have been available since
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh BUGS
Although the functions do not return error codes, it is possible for them
to fail.
This will only happen as a result of a memory allocation failure so this
is not too much of a problem in practice.
