.Sh NAME
.Nm X25519
.Nd EVP_PKEY X25519 support
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
.Vt EVP_PKEY
implementation supports key generation and key derivation using X25519.
It has associated private and public key formats compatible with
draft-ietf-curdle-pkix-03.
.Pp
No additional parameters can be set during key generation.
.Pp
The peer public key must be set using
.Xr EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer 3
when performing key derivation.
.Pp
A context for the
.Nm
algorithm can be obtained by calling:
.Pp
.Dl EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(NID_X25519, NULL);
.Sh EXAMPLES
Generate an
.Nm
private key and write it to standard output in PEM format:
.Bd -literal
#include <openssl/evp.h>
#include <openssl/pem.h>

EVP_PKEY *pkey = NULL;
EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(NID_X25519, NULL);
EVP_PKEY_keygen_init(pctx);
EVP_PKEY_keygen(pctx, &pkey);
EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(pctx);
PEM_write_PrivateKey(stdout, pkey, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);
.Ed
.Pp
The key derivation example in
.Xr EVP_PKEY_derive 3
can be used with
.Nm .
