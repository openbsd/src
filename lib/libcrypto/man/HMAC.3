.Sh DESCRIPTION
HMAC is a MAC (message authentication code), i.e. a keyed hash
function used for message authentication, which is based on a hash
function.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC
computes the message authentication code of the
.Fa n
bytes at
.Fa d
using the hash function
.Fa evp_md
and the key
.Fa key
which is
.Fa key_len
bytes long.
.Pp
It places the result in
.Fa md ,
which must have space for the output of the hash function, which is no
more than
.Dv EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE
bytes.
If
.Fa md
is
.Dv NULL ,
the digest is placed in a static array.
The size of the output is placed in
.Fa md_len ,
unless it is
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
.Fa evp_md
can be
.Xr EVP_sha1 3 ,
.Xr EVP_ripemd160 3 ,
etc.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_CTX_init
initialises a
.Vt HMAC_CTX
before first use.
It must be called.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_CTX_cleanup
erases the key and other data from the
.Vt HMAC_CTX
and releases any associated resources.
It must be called when an
.Vt HMAC_CTX
is no longer required.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_cleanup
is an alias for
.Fn HMAC_CTX_cleanup
included for backward compatibility with 0.9.6b.
It is deprecated and implemented as a macro.
.Pp
The following functions may be used if the message is not completely
stored in memory:
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_Init
initializes a
.Vt HMAC_CTX
structure to use the hash function
.Fa evp_md
and the key
.Fa key
which is
.Fa key_len
bytes long.
It is deprecated and only included for backward compatibility with
OpenSSL 0.9.6b.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_Init_ex
initializes or reuses a
.Vt HMAC_CTX
structure to use the function
.Fa evp_md
and key
.Fa key .
Either can be
.Dv NULL ,
in which case the existing one will be reused.
.Fn HMAC_CTX_init
must have been called before the first use of an
.Vt HMAC_CTX
in this function.
.Sy N.B.
.Fn HMAC_Init
had this undocumented behaviour in previous versions of OpenSSL -
failure to switch to
.Fn HMAC_Init_ex
in programs that expect it will cause them to stop working.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_Update
can be called repeatedly with chunks of the message to be authenticated
.Pq Fa len No bytes at Fa data .
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_Final
places the message authentication code in
.Fa md ,
which must have space for the hash function output.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_CTX_copy
copies all of the internal state from
.Fa sctx
into
.Fa dctx .
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_CTX_set_flags
applies the specified flags to the internal
.Vt EVP_MD_CTX
objects.
Possible flag values
.Dv EVP_MD_CTX_FLAG_*
are defined in
.In openssl/evp.h .
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_size
returns the length in bytes of the underlying hash function output.
It is implemented as a macro.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn HMAC
returns a pointer to the message authentication code or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_Init_ex ,
.Fn HMAC_Update ,
.Fn HMAC_Final ,
and
.Fn HMAC_CTX_copy
return 1 for success or 0 if an error occurred.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_size
returns the length in bytes of the underlying hash function output
or 0 on error.

.Sh HISTORY
.Fn HMAC ,
.Fn HMAC_Init ,
.Fn HMAC_Update ,
.Fn HMAC_Final ,
and
.Fn HMAC_cleanup
are available since SSLeay 0.9.0.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_CTX_init ,
.Fn HMAC_Init_ex ,
and
.Fn HMAC_CTX_cleanup
are available since OpenSSL 0.9.7.
.Pp
.Fn HMAC_Init_ex ,
.Fn HMAC_Update ,
and
.Fn HMAC_Final
did not return values in versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.0.
