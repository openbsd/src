.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm OPENSSL_load_builtin_modules ,
.Nm ASN1_add_oid_module ,
.Nm ENGINE_add_conf_module
.Nd add standard configuration modules
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/conf.h
.Ft void
.Fn OPENSSL_load_builtin_modules void
.Ft void
.Fn ASN1_add_oid_module void
.Ft void
.Fn ENGINE_add_conf_module void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn OPENSSL_load_builtin_modules
adds all the standard OpenSSL configuration modules to the internal
list.
They can then be used by the OpenSSL configuration code.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_add_oid_module
adds just the ASN.1 OBJECT module.
.Pp
.Fn ENGINE_add_conf_module
adds just the ENGINE configuration module.
.Pp
If the simple configuration function
.Xr OPENSSL_config 3
is called then
.Fn OPENSSL_load_builtin_modules
is called automatically.
.Pp
Applications which use configuration functions like
.Xr CONF_modules_load_file 3
directly need to call
.Fn OPENSSL_load_builtin_modules
themselves
.Em before
any other configuration code.
.Pp
Applications should call
.Xr OPENSSL_config 3
or
.Fn OPENSSL_load_builtin_modules
to load all configuration modules instead of adding modules selectively:
otherwise functionality may be missing from the application when
new modules are added.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr CONF_modules_load_file 3 ,
.Xr OPENSSL_config 3
.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared in OpenSSL 0.9.7
and have been available since
.Ox 3.2 .
