.Sh DESCRIPTION
In addition to the global table described in
.Xr ENGINE_add 3 ,
the crypto library maintains several tables containing references to
.Vt ENGINE
objects implementing one specific cryptographic algorithm.
.Pp
The functions listed in the present manual page append
.Fa e
to the end of the table for the respective algorithm.
.Pp
If
.Fa e
does not contain a method for the requested algorithm,
these functions succeed without having any effect.
.Pp
If
.Fa e
is already registered for the given algorithm,
they move it to the end of the respective table.
.Pp
.Fn ENGINE_register_ciphers
and
.Fn ENGINE_register_digests
are special in so far as an engine may implement
more than one cipher or more than one digest.
In that case,
.Fa e
is registered for all the ciphers or digests it implements.
.Pp
.Fn ENGINE_register_complete
registers
.Fa e
for all algorithms it implements by calling all the other functions.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return 1 on success or 0 on error.
They only fail if insufficient memory is available.

.Fn ENGINE_register_complete
ignores all errors, even memory allocation failure, and always returns 1.
