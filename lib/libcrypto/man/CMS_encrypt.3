.Dt CMS_ENCRYPT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm CMS_encrypt
.Nd create a CMS envelopedData structure
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/cms.h
.Ft CMS_ContentInfo *
.Fo CMS_encrypt
.Fa "STACK_OF(X509) *certs"
.Fa "BIO *in"
.Fa "const EVP_CIPHER *cipher"
.Fa "unsigned int flags"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn CMS_encrypt
creates and returns a CMS EnvelopedData structure.
.Fa certs
is a list of recipient certificates.
.Fa in
is the content to be encrypted.
.Fa cipher
is the symmetric cipher to use.
.Fa flags
is an optional set of flags.
.Pp
Only certificates carrying RSA, Diffie-Hellman or EC keys are supported
by this function.
.Pp
.Xr EVP_des_ede3_cbc 3
(triple DES) is the algorithm of choice for S/MIME use because most
clients will support it.
.Pp
The algorithm passed in the
.Fa cipher
parameter must support ASN1 encoding of its parameters.
.Pp
Many browsers implement a "sign and encrypt" option which is simply an
S/MIME envelopedData containing an S/MIME signed message.
This can be readily produced by storing the S/MIME signed message in a
memory BIO and passing it to
.Fn CMS_encrypt .
.Pp
The following flags can be passed in the
.Fa flags
parameter:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv CMS_TEXT
MIME headers for type text/plain are prepended to the data.
.It Dv CMS_BINARY
Do not translate the supplied content into MIME canonical format
even though that is required by the S/MIME specifications.
This option should be used if the supplied data is in binary format.
Otherwise, the translation will corrupt it.
If
.Dv CMS_BINARY
is set, then
.Dv CMS_TEXT
is ignored.
.It Dv CMS_USE_KEYID
Use the subject key identifier value to identify recipient certificates.
An error occurs if all recipient certificates do not have a subject key
identifier extension.
By default, issuer name and serial number are used instead.
.It Dv CMS_STREAM
Return a partial
.Vt CMS_ContentInfo
structure suitable for streaming I/O: no data is read from the BIO
.Fa in .
.It Dv CMS_PARTIAL
Return a partial
.Vt CMS_ContentInfo
structure to which additional recipients and attributes can
be added before finalization.
.It Dv CMS_DETACHED
Omit the data being encrypted from the
.Vt CMS_ContentInfo
structure.
This is rarely used in practice and is not supported by
.Xr SMIME_write_CMS 3 .
.El
.Pp
If the flag
.Dv CMS_STREAM
is set, the returned
.Vt CMS_ContentInfo
structure is
.Em not
complete and outputting its contents via a function that does not
properly finalize the
.Vt CMS_ContentInfo
structure will give unpredictable results.
.Pp
Several functions including
.Xr SMIME_write_CMS 3 ,
.Xr i2d_CMS_bio_stream 3 ,
.Xr PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream 3
finalize the structure.
Alternatively finalization can be performed by obtaining the streaming
ASN1
.Vt BIO
directly using
.Xr BIO_new_CMS 3 .
.Pp
The recipients specified in
.Fa certs
use a CMS KeyTransRecipientInfo info structure.
KEKRecipientInfo is also supported using the flag
.Dv CMS_PARTIAL
and
.Xr CMS_add0_recipient_key 3 .
.Pp
The parameter
.Fa certs
may be
.Dv NULL
if
.Dv CMS_PARTIAL
is set and recipients are added later using
.Xr CMS_add1_recipient_cert 3
or
.Xr CMS_add0_recipient_key 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn CMS_encrypt
returns either a
.Vt CMS_ContentInfo
structure or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
The error can be obtained from
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr CMS_decrypt 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn CMS_encrypt
was added to OpenSSL 0.9.8.
The
.Sy CMS_STREAM
flag was first supported in OpenSSL 1.0.0.
