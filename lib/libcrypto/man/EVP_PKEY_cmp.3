.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn EVP_PKEY_missing_parameters
returns 1 if the public key parameters of
.Fa pkey
are missing and 0 if they are present or the algorithm doesn't use
parameters.
.Pp
The function
.Fn EVP_PKEY_copy_parameters
copies the parameters from key
.Fa from
to key
.Fa to .
An error is returned if the parameters are missing in
.Fa from .
.Pp
The function
.Fn EVP_PKEY_cmp_parameters
compares the parameters of keys
.Fa a
and
.Fa b .
.Pp
The function
.Fn EVP_PKEY_cmp
compares the public key components and parameters (if present) of keys
.Fa a
and
.Fa b .
.Pp
The main purpose of the functions
.Fn EVP_PKEY_missing_parameters
and
.Fn EVP_PKEY_copy_parameters
is to handle public keys in certificates where the parameters are
sometimes omitted from a public key if they are inherited from the CA
that signed it.
.Pp
Since OpenSSL private keys contain public key components too, the
function
.Fn EVP_PKEY_cmp
can also be used to determine if a private key matches a public key.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The function
.Fn EVP_PKEY_missing_parameters
returns 1 if the public key parameters of
.Fa pkey
are missing and 0 if they are present or the algorithm doesn't use
parameters.
.Pp
The function
.Fn EVP_PKEY_copy_parameters
returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn EVP_PKEY_cmp_parameters
and
.Fn EVP_PKEY_cmp
return 1 if the keys match, 0 if they don't match, -1 if the key types
are different and -2 if the operation is not supported.
