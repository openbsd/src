.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_cmp_time
parses
.Fa asn1_time
with
.Xr ASN1_time_parse 3
and compares it to
.Fa cmp_time .
.Fn X509_cmp_current_time
compares it to the current time.
.Pp
.Fn X509_time_adj_ex
sets
.Fa asn1_time
to a time
.Fa offset_day
and
.Fa offset_sec
later than
.Fa in_tm .
.Fn X509_time_adj
does the same with a 0 day offset.
If
.Fa asn1_time
is
.Dv NULL ,
a new
.Vt ASN1_TIME
structure is allocated and returned.
.Pp
In all functions, if
.Fa in_tm
is
.Dv NULL ,
the current time is used.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_cmp_time
and
.Fn X509_cmp_current_time
return -1 if
.Fa asn1_time
is earlier than or equal to
.Fa cmp_time ,
1 if it is later, or 0 on error.
.Pp
.Fn X509_time_adj_ex
and
.Fn X509_time_adj
return a pointer to the updated
.Vt ASN1_TIME
structure or
.Dv NULL
on error.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ASN1_TIME_new 3 ,
.Xr ASN1_time_parse 3 ,
.Xr ASN1_TIME_set 3 ,
