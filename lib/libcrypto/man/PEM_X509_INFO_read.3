.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions read zero or more objects
related to X.509 certificates from
.Fa in_fp
or
.Fa in_bp ,
perform both PEM and DER decoding,
and wrap the resulting objects in newly allocated
.Vt X509_INFO
containers.
.Pp
Setting
.Fa sk
to
.Dv NULL
is recommended, in which case
a new stack is allocated, populated, and returned.
If an existing
.Fa sk
is passed in, the created
.Vt X509_INFO
objects are pushed onto that stack.
.Pp
For PEM decoding,
.Xr PEM_read_bio 3
is used internally, implying that any non-PEM data
before, between, and after the objects is silently discarded.
.Pp
For subsequent DER decoding,
the decoding function and the field of the
.Vt X509_INFO
structure to store the new object in
are selected according to the PEM type name:
.Bl -column "TRUSTED CERTIFICATE" "d2i_PrivateKey()" "revocation list"
.It PEM type name       Ta decoder             Ta Vt X509_INFO No field
.It CERTIFICATE         Ta Xr d2i_X509 3       Ta certificate
.It X509 CERTIFICATE    Ta Xr d2i_X509 3       Ta certificate
.It TRUSTED CERTIFICATE Ta Xr d2i_X509_AUX 3   Ta certificate
.It X509 CRL            Ta Xr d2i_X509_CRL 3   Ta revocation list
.It RSA PRIVATE KEY     Ta Xr d2i_PrivateKey 3 Ta private key
.It DSA PRIVATE KEY     Ta Xr d2i_PrivateKey 3 Ta private key
.It EC PRIVATE KEY      Ta Xr d2i_PrivateKey 3 Ta private key
.El
.Pp
Whenever the selected field is already occupied, another new
.Vt X509_INFO
container is allocated and pushed onto the stack.
Depending on the sequence of objects in the input, this can result
in several partially populated
.Vt X509_INFO
containers being pushed onto the stack.
.Pp
PEM objects of types not listed in the above table are silently skipped.
.Pp
Encrypted certificates and revocation lists are decrypted by calling
.Xr PEM_do_header 3
internally, passing through the optional arguments
.Fa cb
and
.Fa u .
Encrypted private keys are not decrypted.
Instead, the encrypted form is stored as read.
All the same,
.Xr PEM_get_EVP_CIPHER_INFO 3
is called internally to check that PEM headers, if there are any,
are valid and specify an encryption the library is prepared to handle.
.Pp
If any error occurs, objects that had already been read
during the same call are deleted again and
.Fa sk
is left unchanged.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return a pointer to the stack
the objects read were pushed onto or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
They fail if
.Xr PEM_read_bio 3 ,
.Xr PEM_get_EVP_CIPHER_INFO 3 ,
.Xr PEM_do_header 3 ,
or DER decoding fails or if memory is exhausted.
.Sh ERRORS
Diagnostics that can be retrieved with
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 ,
.Xr ERR_GET_REASON 3 ,
and
.Xr ERR_reason_error_string 3
include:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv ERR_R_ASN1_LIB Qq "ASN1 lib"
DER decoding of a PEM object failed.
.It Dv ERR_R_BUF_LIB Qq BUF lib
.Fn PEM_X509_INFO_read
failed to set up a temporary BIO, for example because memory was exhausted.
.It Dv ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE Qq "malloc failure"
.Fn PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio
failed to allocate a new
.Vt X509_INFO ,
.Vt STACK_OF(X509_INFO) ,
or
.Vt X509_PKEY
object.
.El
.Pp
Additional types of errors can result from
.Xr PEM_read_bio 3 ,
.Xr PEM_get_EVP_CIPHER_INFO 3 ,
and
.Xr PEM_do_header 3 .
.Pp
After these functions failed due to memory exhaustion,
.Xr ERR_get_error 3
may sometimes return 0 anyway.

.Sh HISTORY
.Fn PEM_X509_INFO_read
first appeared in SSLeay 0.5.1 and
.Fn PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio
in SSLeay 0.6.0.
Both functions have been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Sh CAVEATS
It is not an error
if the input does not contain any objects of the desired types.
In that case, nothing is added to
.Fa sk ,
or if
.Fa sk
is
.Dv NULL ,
a newly allocated, empty stack is returned.
The only way to detect this situation is by comparing
the number of objects on the stack before and after the call.
.Sh BUGS
When reaching the end of the input, these functions call
.Xr ERR_clear_error 3 ,
which may hide errors that occurred before calling these functions.
