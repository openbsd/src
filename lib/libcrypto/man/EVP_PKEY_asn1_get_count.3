.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_get_count
returns the number of public key ASN.1 methods available.
It includes standard methods and any methods added by the application.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_get0
returns the public key ASN.1 method
.Fa idx .
The value of
.Fa idx
must be in the range from zero to
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_get_count
\- 1.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_find
looks up the method with NID
.Fa type ,
which can be any of the values that
.Xr EVP_PKEY_base_id 3
and
.Xr EVP_PKEY_id 3
may return.
If
.Fa pe
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it first looks for an engine implementing a method for the NID
.Fa type .
If one is found,
.Pf * Fa pe
is set to that engine and the method from that engine is returned instead.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_find_str
looks up the method with PEM type string
.Fa str .
The PEM type strings supported by default are listed in the
.Xr EVP_PKEY_base_id 3
manual page.
Just like
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_find ,
if
.Fa pe
is not
.Dv NULL ,
methods from engines are preferred.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_get0_info
retrieves the public key ID as returned by
.Xr EVP_PKEY_id 3 ,
the base public key ID as returned by
.Xr EVP_PKEY_base_id 3
.Pq both NIDs ,
any flags, the method description,
and the PEM type string associated with
.Fa ameth .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_get_count ,
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_get0 ,
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_find
and
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_find_str
are not thread safe, but as long as all
.Vt EVP_PKEY_ASN1_METHOD
objects are added before the application gets threaded, using them is
safe.
See
.Xr EVP_PKEY_asn1_add0 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_get_count
returns the number of available public key methods.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_get0
returns a public key method or
.Dv NULL
if
.Fa idx
is out of range.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_get0_asn1
returns the public key method used by
.Fa pkey .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_asn1_get0_info
returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.

.Xr EVP_PKEY_new 3
.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared in OpenSSL 1.0.0
and have been available since
.Ox 4.9 .
