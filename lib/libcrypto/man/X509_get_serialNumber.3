.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm X509_get_serialNumber ,
.Nm X509_set_serialNumber
.Nd get or set certificate serial number
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/x509.h
.Ft ASN1_INTEGER *
.Fo X509_get_serialNumber
.Fa "X509 *x"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fo X509_set_serialNumber
.Fa "X509 *x"
.Fa "ASN1_INTEGER *serial"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_get_serialNumber
returns the serial number of certificate
.Fa x
as an
.Vt ASN1_INTEGER
structure which can be examined or initialised.
The value returned is an internal pointer which must not be freed
up after the call.
.Pp
.Fn X509_set_serialNumber
sets the serial number of certificate
.Fa x
to
.Fa serial .
A copy of the serial number is used internally so
.Fa serial
should be freed up after use.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_get_serialNumber
returns an
.Vt ASN1_INTEGER
structure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_set_serialNumber
returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.
