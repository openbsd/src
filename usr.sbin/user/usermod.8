.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility modifies user login information on the system.
Default values for the user are taken from the information
provided in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
.Pp
After setting any defaults, and then values from that file,
the command line options are processed:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl G Ar secondary-group[,group,...]
are the secondary groups the user will be a member of in the
.Pa /etc/group
file.
.It Fl c Ar comment
is the comment field (also, for historical reasons known as the
GECOS field) which will be added for the user, and typically will include
the username, and, perhaps, contact information for the user.
.It Fl d Ar home-directory
sets the home directory to
.Ar home-directory
without populating it; if the
.Fl m
option is specified, tries to move the old home directory to
.Ar home-directory .
.It Fl e Ar expiry-time
provides the date at which the account expires. This should be given
in a standard time format (%c). This is unset by default.
This value can be preset for all users by using the
.Ar expire
field in /etc/usermgmt.conf file - it has the format:
.D1 Ic expire Ar expiry-time
.It Fl f Ar password-change-secs 
provides the number of seconds since the epoch (UTC) at
which the current password must be changed. This
can be used to implement password aging.
A value of
0 can be used to switch off this feature.
The default value for this field is 0.
See
.Xr passwd 5
for more details.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar inactive 
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.D1 Ic inactive Ar password-change-secs
.It Xo
.Fl g Ar gid | name | Li =uid
.Xc
gives the group name or identifier to be used for the new user's primary group.
If this is
.Ql =uid ,
then a uid and gid will be picked which are both unique
and the same, and a line added to
.Pa /etc/group
to describe the new group.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar gid
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.br \" XXX Shouldn't be necessary -- mdoc bug? --bjh21
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Ic group
.Ar gid | name | Li =uid
.Ed
.It Fl L Ar login-class
this option sets the login class for the user being created.  See
.Xr login.conf 5
for more information on user login classes. This value can be preset
for all users by using the
.Ar class
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.br \" XXX skip empty line? - HF
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Ic class
.Ar login-class
.Ed
.It Fl l Ar new-user
gives the new user name.
It must consist of alphanumeric characters, or the characters
.Ql \&. ,
.Ql \&-
or
.Ql \&_ .
.It Fl m
moves the home directory from its old position to the new one.
If
.Fl d
is not specified, the
.Ar new-user
argument of the
.Fl l
option is used; one of
.Fl d
and
.Fl l
is needed.
.It Fl o
allows duplicate uids to be given.
.It Fl p Ar password
specifies an already-encrypted password for the new user.
This password can then be changed by using the
.Xr chpass 1
utility.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar password
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.D1 Ic password Ar encrypted-password
.It Fl s Ar shell
specifies the login shell for the new user.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar shell
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.D1 Ic shell Ar login-shell
.It Fl u Ar uid
specifies a new uid for the user.
Boundaries for this value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar range
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - they have the format:
.br \" XXX
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Ic range
.Ar starting-uid Ns Li .. Ns Ar ending_uid
.Ed
.It Fl v
enables verbose mode - explain the commands as they are executed.
.El
.Pp
Once the information has been verified,
.Nm
uses
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8
to update the user database.  This is run in the background, and,
at very large sites could take several minutes.  Until this update
is completed, the password file is unavailable for other updates
and the new information is not available to programs.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
