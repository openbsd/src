.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm useradd
utility adds a user to the system, creating and
populating a home directory if necessary.
Any skeleton files will be provided
for the new user if they exist in the
.Pa /etc/skel
directory.
Default values for
the base directory,
the time of password expiry,
seconds until password change,
primary group,
the skeleton directory,
the range from which the uid will be allocated,
and default login shell
can be provided in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
.Pp
The first format of the command shown above (utilising the
.Fl D
option)
sets and displays the defaults for the
.Nm
utility.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
without any further options,
.Fl D
will show the current defaults which
will be used by the
.Nm
utility. Together with one of the options shown for the first version
of the command,
.Fl D
will set the default to be the new value.
.It Fl b Ar base-dir
sets the base directory. This is the directory to which the user name
is added, which will be created if the
.Fl m
option is specified and no
.Fl d
option is specified.
.It Fl e Ar expiry-time
sets the time at which the current password will expire for new users.
.It Fl f Ar password-change-secs
provides the number of seconds since the epoch (UTC) at
which the current password must be changed. This
can be used to implement password aging.
A value of
0 can be used to switch off this feature.
The default value for this field is 0.
See
.Xr passwd 5
for more details.
.It Fl g Ar gid | groupname | Li =uid
sets the default group for any user added using the
.Nm
command.
.It Fl k Ar skel-dir
sets the skeleton directory in which to find files with
which to populate new users' home directories.
.It Fl L Ar login-class
This option sets the login class for the user being created.  See
.Xr login.conf 5
for more information on login classes.
.It Xo
.Fl r Ar low Ns Li .. Ns Ar high
.Xc
sets the low and high bounds of uid ranges for new users. A new user
can only be created if there are uids which can be assigned from one
of the free ranges.
.It Fl s Ar shell
sets the login shell for new users.
.El
.Pp
In the second form of the command,
after setting any defaults, and then values from that file,
the command line options are processed:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl G Ar secondary-group[,group,...]
is the secondary groups to which the user will be added in the
.Pa /etc/group
file.
.It Fl b Ar base-directory
is the base directory name, in which the user's new home
directory will be created, should the -m option be specified.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar base_dir
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.D1 Ic base_dir Ar path-to-base-dir
.It Fl c Ar comment
is the comment field (also, for historical reasons known as the
GECOS field) which will be added for the user, and typically will include
the username, and, perhaps, contact information for the user.
.It Fl d Ar home-directory
is the home directory which will be created and populated for the user,
should the -m option be specified.
.It Fl e Ar secs-to-expiry
provides the number of seconds since the epoch (UTC) at
which the current password change expire. This
can be used to implement password aging.
A value of
0 can be used to switch off this feature.
The default value for this field is 0.
See
.Xr passwd 5
for more details.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar expire
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.D1 Ic expire Ar secs-to-expiry
.It Fl g Ar gid | name | Li =uid
gives the group name or identifier to be used for the new user's primary group.
If this is
.Ql =uid ,
then a uid and gid will be picked which are both unique
and the same, and a line added to
.Pa /etc/group
to describe the new group.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar gid
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.br \" XXX This shouldn't be needed -- mdoc bug? --bjh21
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Ic group
.Ar gid | name | Li =uid
.Ed
.It Fl k Ar skeleton directory
gives the skeleton directory in which to find files
with which to populate the new user's home directory.
This value can be preset for all users by using the
.Ar skel_dir
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.D1 Ic skel_dir Ar path-to-skeleton-dir
.It Fl L Ar login-class
This option sets the login class for the user being created.  See
.Xr login.conf 5
for more information on login classes. This value can be preset
for all users by using the
.Ar class
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.D1 Ic class Ar login-class
.It Fl m
create a new home directory for the new user.
.It Fl o
allow the new user to have a uid which is already in use for another user.
.It Fl p Ar password
specifies an already-encrypted password for the new user.
This password can then be changed by using the
.Xr chpass 1
utility.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar password
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.D1 Ic password Ar encrypted-password
.It Fl s Ar shell
specifies the login shell for the new user.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar shell
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - it has the format:
.D1 Ic shell Ar login-shell
.It Fl u Ar uid
specifies a uid for the new user.
Boundaries for this value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar range
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file - they have the format:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent -compact
.Ic range Ar starting-uid Ns Li .. Ns Ar ending-uid
.Ed
.It Fl v
enables verbose mode - explain the commands as they are executed.
.El
.Pp
Once the information has been verified,
.Nm
uses
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8
to update the user database.  This is run in the background, and,
at very large sites could take several minutes.  Until this update
is completed, the password file is unavailable for other updates
and the new information is not available to programs.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
