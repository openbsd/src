.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ypserv
.Op Fl 1
.Op Fl a Ar aclfile
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl x
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Ypserv
is a fundamental part of the network information system called YP.
This server provides information from YP maps to the YP clients
on the network.
.Pp
A YP map is stored on the server as a
.Xr db 3
database. A number of YP maps is grouped together in a domain.
.Ar Ypserv
determines the domains it serves by looking for a directory with
the domain name in 
.Ar /var/yp .
.Pp
YP hasn't been known for high security through the years. In recent years
security has improved by restricting access to the server. In SunOS 4.1
has a new file occured named
.Ar /var/yp/securenet .
It contains networks the server can assume is secure. For information about
file format see
.Xr securenet 5 .
.Pp
Before the author of this server had seen 
.Xr securenet 5
another format was implemented
.Xr ypserv.acl 5 .
This file format makes it possible to allow and deny hosts and networks
access to the server. This file can have any name since it's given by
the argument to
.Fl a 
(use full path). 
.Pp
The file used can be reread by sending a SIGHUP to ypserv. The process pid
can be found in the file
.Nm /var/run/ypserv.pid
.
.Pp
If a host isn't secure all queries to the server will result in a YP_NODOM
result.
.Pp
If the file
.Nm /var/yp/ypserv.log
exists then messages will be written to the file.
.Pp
If a directory named the same as the system domainname exists in
.Nm /var/yp/
(ie. the domainname is
.Nm foo
and directory
.Nm /var/yp/foo
exists), then ypserv will be automatically started at boot time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 1
Allow ypserv to answer old YP version 1 requests.
.It Fl a Ar aclfile
Don't use 
.Ar /var/yp/securenet .
Use another file with another file format. For futher information see
man page for
.Ar ypserv.acl .
.It Fl d
Use Internet Domain Name System. If a query to map
.Ar hosts.byname
or
.Ar hosts.byaddr
fails, make a DNS query and return the result if successful.
Alternately, if these maps were built on the YP master using
.Nm makedbm
.Fl b
then DNS queries will be done without needing to specify
.Fl d . 
.It Fl x
Terminate the server after processing
.Ar aclfile
or
.Ar /var/yp/securenet .
