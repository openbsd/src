.Sh SYNOPSIS

installs or updates the relevant packages from the Internet.

distributed with
.Ox .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Pass the
.Fl n
flag to
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
causing it to not actually install any firmware packages,
just report the steps that would be taken if it was.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output and pass the
.Fl v
flag to
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
This flag can be specified multiple times for increased
.Xr pkg_add 1
verbosity.
