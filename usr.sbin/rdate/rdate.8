.Dt RDATE 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rdate
.Nd set the system's date from a remote host
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rdate
.Op Fl 46acnpsv
.Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays and sets the local date and time from the
host name or address given as the argument.
The time source may be an RFC 868 TCP protocol server,
which is usually implemented as a built-in service of
.Xr inetd 8 ,
or an RFC 2030 protocol SNTP/NTP server.
By default,
.Nm
uses the RFC 868 TCP protocol.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl a
Use the
.Xr adjtime 2
call to gradually skew the local time to the
remote time rather than just hopping.
.It Fl c
Correct leap seconds.
This should be used only when syncronizing to a server
which does not correctly account for leap seconds.
.It Fl n
Use SNTP (RFC 2030) instead of the RFC 868 time protocol.
.It Fl p
Do not set, just print the remote time.
.It Fl s
Do not print the time.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
Always show the adjustment.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/wtmp -compact
.It Pa /var/log/wtmp
record of date resets and time changes
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To get the legal time in Germany, set the
.Pa /etc/localtime
symlink to
.Pa /usr/share/zoneinfo/right/Europe/Berlin
and issue the following command:
.Pp
.D1 Li "# rdate -nv ptbtime1.ptb.de"
.Pp
The command of course assumes you have a working internet connection
and DNS set up to connect to the server at
.Sy Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
in Braunschweig, Germany.
