.Sh NAME
.Nm rdate
.Nd set the system's date from a remote host
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rdate
.Op Fl npsav
.Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays and sets the local date and time from the
host name or address given as the argument.
The time source may be an RFC868 TCP protocol server,
which is usually implemented as a built-in service of
.Xr inetd 8 ,
or an RFC1361 protocol SNTP/NTP server.
By default,
.Nm
uses the RFC868 TCP protocol.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Use SNTP (RFC1361) instead of the RFC868 time protocol.
.It Fl p
Do not set, just print the remote time.
.It Fl s
Do not print the time.
.It Fl a
Use the
.Xr adjtime 2
call to gradually skew the local time to the
remote time rather than just hopping.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/wtmp -compact
.It Pa /var/log/wtmp
record of date resets and time changes
