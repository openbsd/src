.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility details the route IPv6 packets take to reach a network host.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Debug mode.
.It Fl f Ar firsthop
Specify how many hops to skip.
.It Fl g Ar gateway
Specify an intermediate gateway
.Po
.Nm
uses a routing header
.Pc .
.It Fl I
Use ICMP6 ECHO instead of UDP datagrams.
.It Fl l
Print both host hostnames and numeric addresses.
Normally
.Nm
prints only hostnames if
.Fl n
is not specified, and only numeric addresses if
.Fl n
is specified.
.It Fl m Ar hoplimit
Specify a maximum hoplimit.
.It Fl n
Do not resolve numeric addresses.
.It Fl p Ar port
Set UDP port number to
.Ar port .
.It Fl q Ar probes
Set the number of probes per hop count to
.Ar probes .
.It Fl r
Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached
network.
If the host is not on a directly attached network,
an error is returned.
This option corresponds to the
.Dv SO_DONTROUTE
socket option;
it can be used to ping a local host through an interface
that has no route through it
(e.g. after the interface was dropped by a routing daemon).
.It Fl s Ar src
Specify the source IPv6 address to be used.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
.It Fl w Ar waittime
Specify the time delay between probes.
