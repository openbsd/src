.Br
.Nm apm
.Op Fl AabCHLlmPSsvz
.Op Fl f Ar sockname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
communicates with the Advanced Power Management daemon,
.Xr apmd 8 ,
making requests of it for current power status or to place the system
into a suspend or stand-by state.
With no flags,
.Nm
displays the current power management state in verbose form.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Set
.Xr apmd 8
to automatic performance adjustment mode.
.It Fl a
Display the external charger (A/C status).
0 means disconnected, 1
means connected, 2 means backup power source, and 255 means unknown.
.It Fl b
Display the battery status.
0 means high, 1 means low, 2 means
critical, 3 means charging, 4 means absent, and 255 means unknown.
.It Fl C
Set
.Xr apmd 8
to cool running performance adjustment mode.
.It Fl f Ar sockname
Set the name of the socket via which to contact
.Xr apmd 8
to
.Pa sockname .
.It Fl H
Set
.Xr apmd 8
to manual performance adjustment mode and
.Va hw.setperf
to 100.
.It Fl L
Set
.Xr apmd 8
to manual performance adjustment mode and
.Va hw.setperf
to 0.
.It Fl l
Display the estimated battery lifetime (in percent).
.It Fl m
Display the estimated battery lifetime (in minutes).
.It Fl P
Display the performance adjustment mode.
0 means uninitialized, 1 means manual, 2 means automatic mode, and 3
means cool running mode.
.It Fl S
Put the system into stand-by (light sleep) mode.
.It Fl s

.El
.Pp
The
.Nm zzz
variant on this command is an alternative for suspending the system.
With no arguments,
.Nm zzz
places the system into suspend mode.
The command line flags serve the same purpose as for the
.Nm
variant of this command.
.Pp
This command does not wait for positive confirmation that the requested
mode has been entered; to do so would mean the command does not return
until the system resumes from its sleep state.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/apmdev -compact
.It Pa /var/run/apmdev
default Unix domain socket for communicating with
.Xr apmd 8
.El
