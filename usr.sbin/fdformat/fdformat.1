.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm fdformat
formats a floppy disk at device
.Ar device_name .
.Ar device_name
should be a character device; it may be given either with a full path
name of a raw device node for a floppy disk drive
.Pq e.g., Pa /dev/rfd0c ,
or default name in an abbreviated form,
.Pq e.g., Em fd0 .
Note that any geometry constraints of the device node
.Pq minor device number
are meaningless, since they're overridden by
.Nm fdformat .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Fl n
Don't verify floppy after formatting.
.Pp
.It Fl q
Suppress any normal output from the command, and don't ask the
user for confirmation whether to format the floppy disk at
.Ar device_name .
.Pp
.It Fl v
Don't format; verify only.
.Pp
.It Fl c Ar cyls
.It Fl F Ar fillbyte
.It Fl g Ar gap3len
.It Fl h Ar heads
.It Fl i Ar intleave
.It Fl r Ar rate
.It Fl S Ar secshft
.It Fl s Ar secs
.It Fl t Ar steps_per_track
An alternate method to specify the geometry data to write to the floppy disk.
.El
.Pp
If the
.Fl q
flag has not been specified, the user is asked for confirmation
of the intended formatting process.
In order to continue, an answer of
.Dq y
must be given.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Unless
.Fl q
has been specified, a single letter is printed to standard output
to inform the user about the progress of work.
First, an
.Dq F
is printed when the track(s) is being formatted, then a
.Dq V
while it's being verified, and if an error has been detected, it
will finally change to
.Dq E .
.Pp
An exit status of 0 is returned upon successful operation.
Exit status
1 is returned on any errors during floppy formatting, and an exit status
of 2 reflects invalid arguments given to the program (along with
appropriate information written to diagnostic output).

floppy disk driver.
It later became part of
.Fx 1.1 ,
and was then ported to
.Ox 1.2 .
