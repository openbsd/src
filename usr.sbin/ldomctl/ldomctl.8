.Sh NAME
.Nm ldomctl
.Nd Logical Domain management interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ldomctl
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to manage logical domains on sun4v systems.
It can be used to assign resources to the primary and guest domains,
start and stop guest domains from the primary domain, and to display
information about domains running on the system.
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm delete Ar configuration
Delete the specified configuration from non-volatile storage.
.It Cm download Ar directory
Save a logical domain configuration to non-volatile storage on the
service processor.
The configuration will take effect after the primary domain is rebooted.
The name of the configuration is taken from the name of the
.Ar directory
which must contain files created with the
.Cm init-system
command.
The download is aborted if a configuration with the same name already exists.
.It Cm dump
Dump the current configuration from non-volatile storage into the current
working directory.
.It Cm init-system Ar file
Generates files describing a logical domain configuration.
The generated files are written to the current working directory.
The provided
.Ar file
describes resources assigned to logical domains in a plain text format
with the following syntax:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic domain Ar name Ic \&{ Ar resource ... Ic \&}
Declares a scope for resources assigned to the specified domain.
The scope must be opened and closed with curly braces and contains
one or more of the following keywords, each on a separate line.
A scope with
.Ar name
"primary" configures resources for the primary domain.
If no configuration for the primary domain exists it is assigned
all CPU and memory resources not used by any guest domains.
.It Ic vcpu Ar number
Declares the number of virtual CPUs assigned to a domain.
.It Ic memory Ar number Ns Op Ar unit
Declares the amount of memory assigned to a domain, in bytes.
Optionally, the units 'K', 'M', or 'G', for kilo-, mega-, and gigabytes
can be used.
.It Ic vdisk Ar file
The specified file is used to back a virtual disk of the guest
domain.
.Ar file
can be a block device node or a disk image file created with
.Xr dd 1 .
This keyword can be used multiple times.
.It Ic vnet Op Ic \&{ Ar keyword value ... Ic \&}
Assign a
.Xr vnet 4
network interface to the guest domain.
This keyword can be used multiple times.
The curly braces are optional and can contain the following keywords:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic mac-addr Ar address
Configures the MAC address of the interface.
.It Ic mtu Ar number
Configures the MTU of the interface.
.El
.El
.It Cm list
List configurations stored in non-volatile storage.
Indicate the currently running configuration,
and the configuration which will be used next
(after rebooting the primary domain) if it differs from the currently running one.
.It Cm panic Ar domain
Panic a guest domain.
The exact behaviour of this command depends on the OS running in the domain.
For
.Ox
the default behaviour is to enter
.Xr ddb 4 .
.It Cm select Ar configuration
Select the next logical domain configuration to use
(after rebooting the primary domain).
.It Cm start Ar domain
Start a guest domain.
.It Cm status Op Ar domain
Display status information for
.Ar domain ,
or for all domains running on the system.
.It Cm stop Ar domain
Stop a guest domain.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
A system using factory defaults has a single "factory-default" configuration:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ldomctl list
factory-default [current]
.Ed
.Pp
Create a new configuration based on the defaults:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mkdir factory-default
# cd factory-default
# ldomctl dump
# cd ..
# cp -R factory-default openbsd
# cd openbsd
.Ed
.Pp
A file describing the desired configuration must be created:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cat ldom.conf
domain puffy {
	vcpu 12
	memory 4G
	vdisk "/home/puffy/vdisk0"
	vdisk "/home/puffy/vdisk1"
	vnet
}

domain salmah {
	vcpu 8
	memory 2G
	vdisk "/home/salmah/vdisk0"
	vdisk "/home/salmah/vdisk1"
	vnet
}
.Ed
.Pp
Generate a set of configuration files and download to non-volatile storage.
If a configuration with the same name already exists, it must be removed first:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ldomctl init-system ldom.conf
# cd ..
# ldomctl delete openbsd
# ldomctl download openbsd
# ldomctl list
factory-default [current]
openbsd [next]
.Ed
.Pp
Create a virtual disk image for each guest domain:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/puffy/vdisk0 bs=1m count=8192
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/salmah/vdisk0 bs=1m count=8192
.Ed
.Pp
The minirootfs install media can be used to boot guest domains:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cp miniroot56.fs /home/puffy/vdisk1
# cp miniroot56.fs /home/salmah/vdisk1
.Ed
.Pp
Enable
.Xr ldomd 8
by adding the following
to
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local :
.Pp
.Dl ldomd_flags=
.Pp
Halt the primary domain and reset the machine from ALOM:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# halt
sc> reset -c
.Ed
.Pp
The machine will now reset and boot into the new configuration.
The primary domain should have less CPUs and memory, since they
are now assigned to the guest domains:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ldomctl status
primary      running      OpenBSD running                   1%
puffy        running      OpenBoot Primary Boot Loader      8%
salmah       running      OpenBoot Primary Boot Loader     12%
.Ed
.Pp
Configure the
.Xr vnet 4
interfaces for the guest domains.
This example bridges guest domains into the physical network:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig vnet0 -inet6 up
# ifconfig vnet1 -inet6 up
# ifconfig bridge0 create
# ifconfig bridge0 add em0 add vnet0 add vnet1 up
.Ed
.Pp
Access the console of the first domain and boot it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cu -l ttyV0
ok boot disk1
.Ed
