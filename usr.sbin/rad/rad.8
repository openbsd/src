.Sh NAME
.Nm rad
.Nd router advertisement daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an IPv6 router advertisement daemon.
It periodically sends IPv6 router advertisement messages with prefix
and default router information.
Clients like
.Xr slaacd 8
use these to configure IPv6 addresses on network interfaces and set default
routes.
Additionally it listens for IPv6 router solicitation messages and responds
with router advertisements.
.Pp
.Nm
is usually started at boot time, and can be enabled by
setting the following in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local :
.Pp
.Dl rad_flags=\&"\&"
.Pp
See
.Xr rc 8
and
.Xr rc.conf 8
for more information on the boot process
and enabling daemons.
.Pp
A running
.Nm
can be controlled with the
.Xr ractl 8
utility.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use an alternate location for the default control socket.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/run/rad.sockXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/rad.conf
Default

configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/rad.sock
.Ux Ns -domain
socket used for communication with
.Xr ractl 8 .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared in
.Ox 6.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
program was written by
.An Florian Obser Aq Mt florian@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
When running
.Nm
on a
.Xr carp 4
interface, it is recommended to either disable SOIIs (persistent Semantically
Opaque Interface Identifiers) on the interface with
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
or ensure that all CARP peers have the same SOII key stored in
.Pa /etc/soii.key .
Otherwise the default IPv6 router's link-local address will change during CARP
failover, which temporarily disrupts connectivity of IPv6 autoconf clients.
