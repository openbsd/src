.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ztsscale
.Nd Zaurus touch screen calibration tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ztsscale
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Zaurus
.Xr lcd 4
screen and
.Xr zts 4
touch point scanning logic is poorly
aligned and requires calibration.
.Nm
is used interactively (and at installation time) to calculate both
the scaling and offset values which will make the pointer act at
the indicated location on the screen.
.Pp
When run as root from the raw console,
.Nm
temporarily takes over the Zaurus
.Xr wsdisplay 4
attached to the
.Xr lcd 4 ,
and prompts for five crosshairs to be touched.
.Pp
When good deviations are calculated from the selections made at these
points,
.Nm
will exit and provide on standard output
a result like the following:
.Pp
.Dl mouse.scale=200,3400,312,3672,0,640,480
.Pp
This result should be placed into
.Pa /etc/wsconsctl.conf
for future use, or can be immediately applied using:
.Pp
.Dl # wsconsctl mouse.scale=200,3400,312,3672,0,640,480
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lcd 4 ,
.Xr zts 4 ,
.Xr wsconsctl.conf 5 ,
.Xr wsconsctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Ox 3.8 .
