.Sh NAME
.Nm vmd
.Nd virtual machine daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vmd
.Op Fl dnv
.Op Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon responsible for the execution of virtual machines (VMs) on a
host.
.Nm
is typically started at boot time and is controlled via
.Xr vmctl 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
can be enabled during system boot by setting the following in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local :
.Pp
.Dl vmd_flags=\&"\&"
.Pp
.Nm
interfaces with the virtual machine monitor (VMM) built into the kernel.
One instance of
.Nm
will be spawned for each VM running on the host, plus extra instances
for control operations.
Each child
.Nm
will in turn create one or more VCPU (virtual CPU) threads responsible for
driving the VM's operations using
.Xr vmm 4 .
.Pp
.Nm
is also responsible for proxying various other commands/requests from
.Xr vmctl 8 ,
such as stopping VMs, and retrieving information from
.Xr vmm 4
about running VMs.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Dssmacro=value
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/exampes/vm.conf .
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Multiple
.Fl v
options increase the verbosity.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/firmware/vmm-biosXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/vmm-bios
Default BIOS boot image.
The BIOS is an external firmware file that is distributed separately
due to an incompatible license.
A prepackaged version of the firmware can be installed using
.Xr fw_update 1 .
.It Pa /etc/examples/vm.conf
Default configuration file.
This is optional.
.It Pa /var/run/vmd.sock
.Ux Ns -domain
socket used for communication with
.Xr vmctl 8 .
