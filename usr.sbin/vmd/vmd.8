.Nd virtual machine daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vmd
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon responsible for the execution of virtual machines (VMs) on a
host.
.Nm
is typically started at boot time and is controlled via
.Xr vmmctl 8 .
.Pp
.Nm 
can be enabled during system boot by setting the following in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local :
.Pp
.Dl vmd_flags=\&"\&"
.Pp
.Nm
interfaces with the virtual machine monitor (VMM) built into the kernel.
One instance of
.Nm
will be spawned for each VM running on the host, plus an extra instance
for control operations. Each child
.Nm
will in turn create one or more VCPU (virtual CPU) threads responsible for
driving the VM's operations using
.Xr vmm 4 .
.Pp
.Nm
is also responsible for proxying various other commands/requests from
.Xr vmmctl 8 ,
such as stopping VMs, and retrieving information from 
.Xr vmm 4 
about running VMs.
