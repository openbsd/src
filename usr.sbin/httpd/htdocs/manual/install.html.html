    <p>This document covers compilation and installation of Apache
    on Unix systems, using the manual build and install method. If
    you wish to use the autoconf-style configure interface, you
    should instead read the INSTALL file in the root directory of
    the Apache source distribution. For compiling and installation
    on specific platforms, see</p>

    <h2>Downloading Apache</h2>
    Information on the latest version of Apache can be found on the
    Apache web server at <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a>. This
    will list the current release, any more recent beta-test
    release, together with details of mirror web and anonymous ftp
    sites. 

    <p>If you downloaded a binary distribution, skip to <a
    href="#install">Installing Apache</a>. Otherwise read the next
    section for how to compile the server.</p>

    <h2>Compiling Apache</h2>
    Compiling Apache consists of three steps: Firstly select which
    Apache <strong>modules</strong> you want to include into the
    server. Secondly create a configuration for your operating
    system. Thirdly compile the executable. 

    <p>All configuration of Apache is performed in the
    <code>src</code> directory of the Apache distribution. Change
    into this directory.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Select modules to compile into Apache in the
        <code>Configuration</code> file. Uncomment lines
        corresponding to those optional modules you wish to include
        (among the AddModule lines at the bottom of the file), or
        add new lines corresponding to additional modules you have
        downloaded or written. (See <a
        href="misc/API.html">API.html</a> for preliminary docs on
        how to write Apache modules). Advanced users can comment
        out some of the default modules if they are sure they will
        not need them (be careful though, since many of the default
        modules are vital for the correct operation and security of
        the server). 

        <p>You should also read the instructions in the
        <code>Configuration</code> file to see if you need to set
        any of the <code>Rule</code> lines.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Configure Apache for your operating system. Normally you
        can just run the <code>Configure</code> script as given
        below. However if this fails or you have any special
        requirements (<em>e.g.</em>, to include an additional
        library required by an optional module) you might need to
        edit one or more of the following options in the
        <code>Configuration</code> file: <code>EXTRA_CFLAGS, LIBS,
        LDFLAGS, INCLUDES</code>. 

        <p>Run the <code>Configure</code> script:</p>

        <blockquote>
<pre>
    % Configure
    Using 'Configuration' as config file
     + configured for &lt;whatever&gt; platform
     + setting C compiler to &lt;whatever&gt; *
     + setting C compiler optimization-level to &lt;whatever&gt; *
     + Adding selected modules
     + doing sanity check on compiler and options
    Creating Makefile in support
    Creating Makefile in main
    Creating Makefile in os/unix
    Creating Makefile in modules/standard
  
</pre>
        </blockquote>
        (*: Depending on Configuration and your system, Configure
        might not print these lines. That's OK). 

        <p>This generates a Makefile for use in stage 3. It also
        creates a Makefile in the support directory, for
        compilation of the optional support programs.</p>

        <p>(If you want to maintain multiple configurations, you
        can give an option to <code>Configure</code> to tell it to
        read an alternative Configuration file, such as
        <code>Configure -file Configuration.ai</code>).</p>
      </li>

      <li>Type <code>make</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    The modules we place in the Apache distribution are the ones we
    have tested and are used regularly by various members of the
    Apache development group. Additional modules contributed by
    members or third parties with specific needs or functions are
    available at &lt;<a
    href="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/contrib/modules/">http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/contrib/modules/</a>&gt;.
    There are instructions on that page for linking these modules
    into the core Apache code. 

    <h2><a id="install" name="install">Installing Apache</a></h2>
    You will have a binary file called <code>httpd</code> in the
    <code>src</code> directory. A binary distribution of Apache
    will supply this file. 

    <p>The next step is to install the program and configure it.
    Apache is designed to be configured and run from the same set
    of directories where it is compiled. If you want to run it from
    somewhere else, make a directory and copy the
    <code>conf</code>, <code>logs</code> and <code>icons</code>
    directories into it. In either case you should read the <a
    href="misc/security_tips.html#serverroot">security tips</a>
    describing how to set the permissions on the server root
    directory.</p>

    <p>The next step is to edit the configuration files for the
    server. This consists of setting up various
    <strong>directives</strong> in up to three central
    configuration files. By default, these files are located in the
    <code>conf</code> directory and are called
    <code>srm.conf</code>, <code>access.conf</code> and
    <code>httpd.conf</code>. To help you get started there are same
    files in the <code>conf</code> directory of the distribution,
    called <code>srm.conf-dist</code>,
    <code>access.conf-dist</code> and <code>httpd.conf-dist</code>.
    Copy or rename these files to the names without the
    <code>-dist</code>. Then edit each of the files. Read the
    comments in each file carefully. Failure to setup these files
    correctly could lead to your server not working or being
    insecure. You should also have an additional file in the
    <code>conf</code> directory called <code>mime.types</code>.
    This file usually does not need editing.</p>

    <p>First edit <code>httpd.conf</code>. This sets up general
    attributes about the server: the port number, the user it runs
    as, <em>etc.</em> Next edit the <code>srm.conf</code> file;
    this sets up the root of the document tree, special functions
    like server-parsed HTML or internal imagemap parsing,
    <em>etc.</em> Finally, edit the <code>access.conf</code> file
    to at least set the base cases of access.</p>

    <p>In addition to these three files, the server behavior can be
    configured on a directory-by-directory basis by using
    <code>.htaccess</code> files in directories accessed by the
    server.</p>

    <h3>Set your system time properly!</h3>
    Proper operation of a public web server requires accurate time
    keeping, since elements of the HTTP protocol are expressed as
    the time of day. So, it's time to investigate setting up NTP or
    some other time synchronization system on your Unix box, or
    whatever the equivalent on NT would be. 

    <h2>Compiling Support Programs</h2>
    In addition to the main <code>httpd</code> server which is
    compiled and configured as above, Apache includes a number of
    support programs. These are not compiled by default. The
    support programs are in the <code>support</code> directory of
    the distribution. To compile the support programs, change into
    this directory and type 
<pre>
    make
</pre>
