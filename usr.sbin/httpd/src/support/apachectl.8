.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm apachectl
.Nd Apache HTTP server control interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar command
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a front end to the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server.
It is designed to help the administrator control the
functioning of the Apache
.Xr httpd 8
daemon.
.Pp
NOTE:
If your Apache installation uses non-standard paths,
you will need to edit the
.Nm
script to set the appropriate paths to your PID file and your
.Xr httpd 8
binary.
See the comments in the script for details.
.Pp
The
.Nm
script returns a 0 exit value on success, and \*(Gt0 if an error occurs.
For more details, view the comments in the script.
.Pp
Full documentation for Apache is available at
.Pa http://httpd.apache.org/ .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Ar command
can be any one or more of the following options:
.Bl -tag -width "configtestXX"
.It Ic configtest
Run a configuration file syntax test.
It parses the configuration files and either reports
.Dq Syntax Ok
or detailed information about the particular syntax error.
.It Ic fullstatus
Displays a full status report from
.Dq mod_status .
For this to work, you need to have mod_status enabled on your server
and a text-based browser such as
.Xr lynx 1
available on your system.
The URL used to access the status report can be set by editing the
.Dv STATUSURL
variable in the script.
.It Ic graceful
Gracefully restarts the Apache daemon by sending it a
.Dv SIGUSR1 .
If the daemon is not running, it is started.
This differs from a normal restart
in that currently open connections are not aborted.
A side effect is that old log files will not be closed immediately.
This means that if used in a log rotation script,
a substantial delay may be necessary to ensure that
the old log files are closed before processing them.
This command automatically checks the configuration files via
.Ic configtest
before initiating the restart to make sure Apache doesn't die.
.It Ic help
Displays a short help message.
.It Ic restart
Restarts the Apache daemon by sending it a
.Dv SIGHUP .
If the daemon is not running, it is started.
This command automatically checks the configuration files via
.Ic configtest
before initiating the restart to make sure Apache doesn't die.
If the Apache daemon runs chrooted
(default in
.Ox )
and 3rd party modules are loaded,
restart may fail due to path inconsistency.
Completely stop and start the daemon instead.
.It Ic start
Start the Apache daemon.
Gives an error if it is already running.
.It Ic status
Displays a brief status report.
Similar to the fullstatus option,
except that the list of requests currently being served is omitted.
.It Ic stop
Stops the Apache daemon.
