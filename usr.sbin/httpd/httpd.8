.Sh NAME
.Nm httpd
.Nd Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol Server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm httpd
.Op Fl FhlLStTuvVX
.Op Fl d Ar serverroot
.Op Fl f Ar config
.Op Fl c Ar directive
.Op Fl C Ar directive
.Op Fl D Ar parameter
.Op Fl R Ar libexecdir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server program. It is
designed to be run as a standalone daemon process. When used like this
it will create a pool of child processes to handle requests. To stop
it, send a TERM signal to the initial (parent) process. The PID of
this process is written to a file as given in the configuration file.
Alternatively
.Nm
may be invoked by the Internet daemon
.Xr inetd 8
each
time a connection to the HTTP service is made.
.Pp
Normally this service can be enabled for startup on OpenBSD
by editing
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
The
.Fl u
option is of particular importance.
.Pp
This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details
of the directives necessary to configure
.Nm
see the Apache manual,
which is part of the Apache distribution or can be found at
.Pa http://www.apache.org/ ,
or in
.Pa /var/www/htdocs/manual .
Paths in this manual page reflect those
compiled into
.Nm
by default with OpenBSD.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl u
By default
.Nm
will
.Xr chroot 2
to the
.Va serverroot
path.
The
.Fl u
option disables this behaviour, and returns
.Nm
to the expanded "unsecure" behaviour.
.Pp
As a result of the default secure behaviour,
.Nm
cannot access any objects outside
.Va ServerRoot
-- this security measure is taken in case
.Nm
is compromised.
This is not without drawbacks, though:
.Pp
CGI programs may fail due to the limited environment available inside
this chroot space.
UserDir, of course, cannot access files outside the directory space.
Other modules will also have issues.
DocumentRoot directories or any other files needed must be inside
.Va ServerRoot .
For this to work, pathnames inside the
.Va config
file do not need adjustment relative to
.Va ServerRoot .
For this option to remain secure, it is important that no files or directories
writable by user
.Ar www
or group
.Ar www
are created inside the
.Va ServerRoot .
.It Fl R Ar libexecdir
This option is only available if
.Nm
was built with the
.Dv SHARED_CORE
rule enabled which forces the
.Nm
core code to be placed into a dynamic shared object (DSO) file. This file
is searched in a hardcoded path under ServerRoot per default. Use this
option to override.
.It Fl d Ar serverroot
Set the initial value for the ServerRoot directive to
.Va serverroot .
This can be overridden by the ServerRoot command in the configuration
file.
The default is
.Pa /var/www .
.It Fl f Ar config
Execute the commands in the file
.Va config
on startup.
If
.Va config
does not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a path relative to
the ServerRoot. The default is
.Pa conf/httpd.conf .
.It Fl C Ar directive
Process the configuration 
.Va directive
before reading config files.
.It Fl c Ar directive
Process the configuration 
.Va directive
after reading config files.
.It Fl D Ar parameter
Sets a configuration 
.Va parameter
which can be used with
<IfDefine>...</IfDefine> sections in the configuration files
to conditionally skip or process commands.
.It Fl F
Run the main process in foreground. For process supervisors.
.It Fl h
Output a short summary of available command line options.
.It Fl l
Output a list of modules compiled into the server.
.It Fl L
Output a list of directives together with expected arguments and
places where the directive is valid.
.It Fl S
Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only shows the
virtualhost settings).
.It Fl t
Run syntax tests for configuration files only, including DocumentRoot checks.
The program immediately exits after this syntax parsing with either a return 
code of 0 (Syntax OK) or return code not equal to 0 (Syntax Error).
.It Fl T
Run syntax tests for configuration files only, without DocumentRoot checks.
The program immediately exits after this syntax parsing with either a return 
code of 0 (Syntax OK) or return code not equal to 0 (Syntax Error).
.It Fl X
Run in single-process mode, for internal debugging purposes only; the daemon
does not detach from the terminal or fork any children. Do NOT use this mode
to provide ordinary web service.
.It Fl v
Print the version of
.Nm Ns ,
and then exit.
.It Fl V
Print the version and build parameters of
.Nm Ns ,
and then exit.
.El
.Pp
The documents served by 
.Nm
should not be owned by the user which 
.Nm
is running as (usually user
.Va www
and group
.Va www Ns ).
They must, however, be readable by this user.
