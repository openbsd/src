.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm httpd.conf
.Nd HTTP daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the HTTP daemon,
.Xr httpd 8 .
.Sh SECTIONS
.Nm
is divided into four main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr httpd 8 .
.It Sy Servers
Listening HTTP web servers.
.It Sy Types
Media types and extensions.
.El
.Pp
Within the sections,
a host
.Ar address
can be specified by IPv4 address, IPv6 address, interface name,
interface group, or DNS hostname.
If the address is an interface name,
.Xr httpd 8
will look up the first IPv4 address and any other IPv4 and IPv6
addresses of the specified network interface.
A
.Ar port
can be specified by number or name.
The port name to number mappings are found in the file
.Pa /etc/services ;
see
.Xr services 5
for details.
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/httpd.conf.local"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic table ,
.Ic relay ,
or
.Ic timeout ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ext_ip="10.0.0.1"
server "default" {
	listen on $ext_ip port 80
}
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
Here are the settings that can be set globally:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic prefork Ar number
Run the specified number of server processes.
This increases the performance and prevents delays when connecting
to a server.
.Xr httpd 8
runs 3 server processes by default.
.El
.Sh SERVERS
The configured web servers.
.Pp
Each
.Ic server
must have a
.Ar name
and include one or more lines of the following syntax:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic directory Oo Ic no Oc Ic auto index
If no index file is found, automatically generate a directory listing.
This is disabled by default.
.It Ic directory Ic index Ar string
Set the directory index file.
If not specified, it defaults to
.Pa index.html .
.It Ic directory no index
Disable the directory index.
.Nm httpd
will neither display nor generate a directory index.
.It Oo Ic no Oc Ic fastcgi Op Ic socket Ar socket
Enable FastCGI instead of serving files.
The
.Ar socket
is a local path name within the
.Xr chroot 2
root directory of
.Nm httpd
and defaults to
.Pa /run/slowcgi.sock .
.It Ic listen on Ar address Ic port Ar number
Set the listen address and port.
.It Ic location Ar path { ... }
Specify server configuration rules for a specific location.
The
.Ar path
argument will be matched against the URL path with shell globbing rules.
A location section may include all of the server configuration rules
except
.Ic listen on
and
.Ic location .
.It Oo Ic no Oc Ic log Op Ar style
Enable writing an access log to syslog.
The
.Ar style
can be
.Ar common ,
.Ar combined
or
.Ar connection .
The styles
.Ar common
and
.Ar combined
write a log entry after each request similar to the standard Apache
and nginx access log formats.
The style
.Ar connection
writes a summarized log entry after each connection,
that can have multiple requests,
similar to the format that is used by
.Xr relayd 8 .
If not specified, the default is
.Ar common .
.It Ic root Ar directory
Set the document root of the server.
The
.Ar directory
is a pathname within the
.Xr chroot 2
root directory of
.Nm httpd .
If not specified, it defaults to
.Pa /htdocs .
.El
.Sh TYPES
Configure the supported media types.
.Nm httpd
will set the
.Ar Content-Type
of the response header based on the file extension listed in the
.Ic types
section.
If not specified,
.Nm httpd
will use built-in media types for
.Ar text/css ,
.Ar text/html ,
.Ar text/plain ,
.Ar image/gif ,
.Ar image/png ,
.Ar image/jpeg ,
and
.Ar application/javascript .
.Pp
The
.Ic types
section must include one or more lines of the following syntax:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar type/subtype Ar name Op Ar name ... ;
Set the media
.Ar type
and
.Ar subtype
to the specified extension
.Ar name .
One or more names can be specified per line.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example will start one server that is pre-forked two
times and listening on the primary IP address of the network interface
that is a member of the
.Ar egress
group.
It additionally defines some media types overriding the defaults.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
prefork 2

server "default" {
	listen on egress port 80
}

types {
	text/css			css;
	text/html			htm html;
	text/txt			txt;
	image/gif			gif;
	image/jpeg			jpg jpeg;
	image/png			png;
	application/javascript		js;
	application/xml			xml;
}
.Ed
.Pp
Multiple servers can be configured to support hosting of different domains.
If the same address is repeated multiple times in the
.Ic listen on
statement,
the server will be matched based on the requested host name.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
server "www.a.example.com" {
	listen on 203.0.113.1 port 80
	root "/htdocs/www.a.example.com"
}

server "www.b.example.com" {
	listen on 203.0.113.1 port 80
	root "/htdocs/www.b.example.com"
}

server "intranet.example.com" {
	listen on 10.0.0.1 port 80
	root "/htdocs/intranet.example.com"
}
.Ed
.Pp
The syntax of the types section is compatible with the format used by
.Xr nginx 8 ,
so it is possible to include its
.Pa mime.types
file directly:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/nginx/mime.types"
