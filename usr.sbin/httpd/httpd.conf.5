.Sh NAME
.Nm httpd.conf

.Xr httpd 8 .
.Sh SECTIONS
.Nm
is divided into three main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx

.El
.Pp
Within the sections,
a host
.Ar address
can be specified by IPv4 address, IPv6 address, interface name,
interface group, or DNS hostname.
If the address is an interface name,
.Xr httpd 8
will look up the first IPv4 address and any other IPv4 and IPv6
addresses of the specified network interface.
A
.Ar port
can be specified by number or name.
The port name to number mappings are found in the file
.Pa /etc/services ;
see
.Xr services 5
for details.
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/httpd.conf.local"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
