.Nm sysmerge
.Nd update system configuration files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Op Fl bd
.Op Fl s Ar src \*(Ba etcXX.tgz
.Op Fl x Ar xetcXX.tgz
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a
.Xr ksh 1
script designed to help the administrator update configuration files
after upgrading to a new release or snapshot.
The configuration files are typically those held in
.Pa /etc ,
though
.Nm
is also able to update files held in
.Pa /dev ,
.Pa /root ,
and
.Pa /var .
.Pp
It is
.Sy HIGHLY
recommended to back up the
.Pa /etc
directory before running this script.
.Pp
.Nm
works by comparing a temporary reference root directory
against currently installed files.
The reference files are created from a
.Xr cvs 1
source tree or a
.Dq .tgz
release or snapshot file.
The default, if no source is specified on the command line,
is to use
.Pa /usr/src .
All work is done under
.Pa ${TMPDIR}/sysmerge.XXXXX
(known as the
.Em work directory ) .
The temporary root directory
.Pa temproot
is created under the work directory.
Each modified and/or replaced file is saved under the
.Pa backup
directory inside the work directory.
.Pp
To make sure configuration files are in sync with the actual binaries,
use the same source as was used to upgrade the system:
.Pa /usr/src
when upgrading from source;
.Pa etcXX.tgz
and
.Pa xetcXX.tgz
when upgrading from binary sets.
.Pp
.Nm
will work through the fileset,
offering the chance to merge any differences using ${MERGE_CMD}.
Merged files may be edited using a default editor,
or one defined by the ${VISUAL} or ${EDITOR} environment variables.
Files may also be left to deal with at a later date.
Should any problems occur,
such as a failure to upgrade a file,
the user will be notified and have to deal with the issue by hand.
.Pp
By default (if
.Fl d
is not used)
.Nm
only compares files whose reference sources have changed since the last run
and attempts to automatically upgrade them to the newest version,
provided that they have no local changes.
It automatically installs missing files and binaries,
and updates files differing only by CVS Id.
Files whose reference sources have matching CVS Id are skipped from comparison.
.Pa /etc/fbtab ,
.Pa /etc/login.conf ,
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf ,
and
.Pa /etc/ttys
are created using helper scripts and are
.Sy always
compared.
.Pp
.Nm
will finish by running
.Xr mtree 8
to make sure the directory structure has correct permissions.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Batch mode.
.Nm
runs non-interactively,
saving differing files for later manual processing.
.It Fl d
Diff mode.
In this mode,
.Nm
will not take any automatic action, allowing for a full diff comparison.
.It Fl s Ar src \*(Ba etcXX.tgz
Specify a path to an
.Ox
top src directory or an etcXX.tgz tarball.
A tarball path specified as an FTP or HTTP URL will be passed
to ${FETCH_CMD}.
.It Fl x Ar xetcXX.tgz
Specify a path to an
xetcXX.tgz tarball.
A tarball path specified as an FTP or HTTP URL will be passed
to ${FETCH_CMD}.
.El
.Pp
Files and directories can be excluded from comparison
by listing them in the file
.Pa /etc/sysmerge.ignore ,
each entry separated by white space or a new line.
The following files will always be skipped from comparison:
.Pa /etc/*.db ,
.Pa /etc/mail/*.db ,
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
.Pa /etc/motd ,
.Pa /etc/myname ,
.Pa /var/db/locate.database ,
.Pa /var/db/sysmerge/etcsum ,
.Pa /var/db/sysmerge/xetcsum ,
.Pa /var/games/tetris.scores ,
.Pa /var/mail/root .
.Pp
The
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration files
.Pa /etc/mail/localhost.cf ,
.Pa /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
and
.Pa /etc/mail/submit.cf
will always differ because they include their build date and directories.
A special test was added to handle this
and they are offered for comparison only if they really differ.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "DESTDIRXXX"
.It Ev DBDIR
Directory in which checksum files are stored.
If unset, this defaults to
.Pa /var/db/sysmerge .
.It Ev DESTDIR
Directory in which to merge and install files.
If unset, this defaults to
.Pa / .
.It Ev EDITOR , VISUAL
Specifies an editor to use.
If both
.Ev EDITOR
and
.Ev VISUAL
are set,
.Ev VISUAL
takes precedence.
If neither
.Ev EDITOR
nor
.Ev VISUAL
are set,
the default is
.Xr vi 1 .
.It Ev FETCH_CMD
Command used to fetch remote files.
Defaults to
.Xr ftp 1 .
.It Ev FTP_KEEPALIVE
Have
.Xr ftp 1
send a byte after every
.Ev FTP_KEEPALIVE
seconds,
so that incorrectly configured network equipment won't aggressively drop it.
See
.Dq ftp -k
for more information.
.It Ev MERGE_CMD
Command used to merge diffs.
This will be called with three arguments: the first argument is the
output file to create, the second argument is the currently installed
file and the third argument is the reference file.
If unset, this defaults to
.Dq sdiff -as -w ${SWIDTH} -o .
.It Ev PAGER
Specifies the pagination program to use.
.It Ev REPORT
Log summary which may contain information for further, manual,
updating.
Defaults to
.Pa ${WRKDIR}/sysmerge.log .
.It Ev TMPDIR
Directory in which the work directory is created.
If unset, this defaults to
.Pa /var/tmp .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "${TMPDIR}/sysmerge.XXXXXXXX" -compact
.It ${TMPDIR}/sysmerge.XXXXX
Default work directory.
The
.Sy temproot
and
.Sy backup
directories are created relative to this.
.It ${WRKDIR}/sysmerge.log
Default log file.
.It /etc/sysmerge.ignore
Files and directories to ignore from comparison.
