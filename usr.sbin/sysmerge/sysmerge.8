.Sh NAME
.Nm sysmerge
.Nd update system configuration files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ab
.Op Fl s Ar src \*(Ba etcXX.tgz
.Op Fl x Ar xetcXX.tgz
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a
.Xr sh 1
script designed to help the administrator update configuration files
after upgrading to a new release or snapshot.
The configuration files are typically those held in
.Pa /etc ,
though
.Nm
is also able to update files held in
.Pa /dev ,
.Pa /root ,
and
.Pa /var .
.Pp
It is
.Sy HIGHLY
recommended to back up the
.Pa /etc
directory before running this script.
.Pp
.Nm
works by comparing a temporary reference root directory
against locally installed files.
The reference files are created from a
.Xr cvs 1
source tree or a
.Dq .tgz
release or snapshot file.
The default, if no source is specified on the command line,
is to use
.Pa /usr/src .
To make sure configuration files are in sync with the actual binaries,
use the same source as was used to upgrade the system:
.Pa /usr/src
when upgrading from source and
.Pa etcXX.tgz
when upgrading from binary sets.
All work is done under
.Pa ${TMPDIR}/sysmerge.XXXXX
(known as the
.Em work directory ) .
The temporary root directory
.Pa temproot
is created under the work directory.
Each modified and/or replaced file is saved under the
.Pa backup
directory inside the work directory.
.Pp
When run in
.Em automatic
mode
.Pq Fl a ,
.Nm
will skip files with identical CVS Id, install missing ones and run commands
associated with the following special files if they were modified:
.Xr aliases 5 ,
.Xr login.conf 5 ,
.Xr MAKEDEV 8 ,
.Xr passwd 5 .
In
.Em manual
mode (the default unless
.Fl a
is specified),
.Nm
will perform a strict comparison of files.
.Pa /etc/fbtab ,
.Pa /etc/login.conf ,
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf ,
and
.Pa /etc/ttys
are created using helper scripts and will
.Sy always
be strictly compared even in
.Fl a
mode.
.Pp
.Nm
will work through the fileset,
offering the chance to merge any differences using
.Xr sdiff 1 .
Files may also be left to deal with at a later date.
Should any problems occur,
such as a failure to upgrade a file,
the user will be notified and have to deal with the issue by hand.
.Pp
Files and directories can be excluded from comparison
by listing them in the file
.Pa /etc/sysmerge.ignore ,
each entry separated by white space or a new line.
The following files will always be skipped from comparison:
.Pa /etc/*.db ,
.Pa /etc/mail/*.db ,
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
.Pa /etc/motd ,
.Pa /etc/myname ,
.Pa /var/mail/root .
.Pp
The
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration files
.Pa /etc/mail/localhost.cf ,
.Pa /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
and
.Pa /etc/mail/submit.cf
will always differ because they include their build date and directories.
A special test was added to handle this
and they are offered for comparison only if they really differ.
.Pp
.Nm
will finish by running
.Xr mtree 8
to make sure the directory structure has correct permissions.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Automatic mode.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will automatically install missing files,
create databases and device nodes,
and will disable strict file comparison when possible (using CVS Ids).
.It Fl b
Batch mode.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run unattended (non-interactively), saving differing files for
later manual processing.
.It Fl s Ar src \*(Ba etcXX.tgz
Specify a path to an
.Ox
top src directory or an etcXX.tgz tarball.
.It Fl x Ar xetcXX.tgz
Specify a path to an
xetcXX.tgz tarball.
If this option is specified, it will add
.Xr X 7
configuration files to the comparison.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "DESTDIRXXX"
.It Ev DESTDIR
Directory in which to merge and install files.
If unset, this defaults to
.Pa / .
.It Ev TMPDIR
Directory in which the work directory is created.
If unset, this defaults to
.Pa /var/tmp .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "${TMPDIR}/sysmerge.XXXXXXXX" -compact
.It ${TMPDIR}/sysmerge.XXXXX
Default work directory.
The
.Sy temproot
and
.Sy backup
directories are created relative to this.
.It /etc/sysmerge.ignore
Files and directories to ignore from comparison.
