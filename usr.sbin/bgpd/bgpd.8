.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a Border Gateway Protocol
.Pq BGP
daemon which manages the network routing tables.
Its main purpose is to exchange information
concerning
.Qq network reachability
with other BGP systems.
.Nm
uses the Border Gateway Protocol, Version 4,
as described in RFC 1771.
Please refer to that document for more information about BGP.
.Pp
.Nm
is usually started at boot time, and can be enabled by
setting the following in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local :
.Pp
.Dl bgpd_flags=\&"\&"
.Pp
See
.Xr rc 8
and
.Xr rc.conf 8
for more information on the boot process
and enabling daemons.
.Pp
When
.Nm
starts up, it reads settings from a configuration file,
typically
.Xr bgpd.conf 5 .
A running
.Nm
process can be controlled using the
.Xr bgpctl 8
utility.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-f fileXXX"
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as the configuration file,
instead of the default
.Pa /etc/bgpd.conf .
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl r Ar path
Open a second, restricted control socket that
.Xr bgpctl 8
can use.
Only
.Em show
requests are allowed on this socket.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
