.Sh NAME
.Nm bgpd.conf
.Nd Border Gateway Protocol daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr bgpd 8
daemon implements the Border Gateway Protocol version 4 as described
in RFC 4271.
.Pp
The
.Nm
config file is divided into the following main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.It Sy Set Configuration
Various lookup tables are defined in this section.
.It Sy Network Announcements
Networks which should be announced by
.Xr bgpd 8
are set in this section.
.It Sy MPLS VPN Configuration
The definition and properties for BGP MPLS VPNs are set in this section.
.It Sy Neighbors and Groups
.Xr bgpd 8
establishes sessions with
.Em neighbors .
The neighbor definition and properties are set in this section, as well as
grouping neighbors for the ease of configuration.
.It Sy Filter
Filter rules for incoming and outgoing
.Em UPDATES .
.El
.Pp
With the exception of macros,
the sections should be grouped and appear in
.Nm
in the order shown above.
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/bgpd/bgpd-10.0.0.1.filter"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic AS ,
.Ic neighbor ,
or
.Ic group ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
peer1="1.2.3.4"
neighbor $peer1 {
	remote-as 65001
}
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
There are quite a few settings that affect the operation of the
.Xr bgpd 8
daemon globally.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic AS Ar as-number Op Ar as-number
Set the local
.Em autonomous system
number to
.Ar as-number .
If the first AS number is a 4-byte AS it is possible to specify a secondary
2-byte AS number which is used for neighbors which do not support 4-byte AS
numbers.
The default for the secondary AS is 23456.
.Pp
The AS numbers are assigned by local RIRs, such as:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxx -compact
.It AfriNIC
for Africa
.It APNIC
for Asia Pacific
.It ARIN
for North America and parts of the Caribbean
.It LACNIC
for Latin America and the Caribbean
.It RIPE NCC
for Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia
.El
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AS 65001
.Ed
.Pp
sets the local AS to 65001.
.Pp
The AS numbers 64512 \(en 65534 are designated for private use.
The AS number 23456 is a specially designated Autonomous System Number and
should not be used.
4-byte AS numbers are specified as two numbers separated by a dot
(ASDOT format),
for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AS 3.10
.Ed
.Pp
or as a large number (ASPLAIN format), for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AS 196618
.Ed
.Pp
.It Ic connect-retry Ar seconds
Set the number of seconds before retrying to open a connection.
This timer should be sufficiently large in EBGP configurations.
The default is 120 seconds.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic dump
.Op Ic rib Ar name
.Pq Ic table Ns | Ns Ic table-mp Ns | Ns Ic table-v2
.Ar file Op Ar timeout
.Xc
.It Xo
.Ic dump
.Pq Ic all Ns | Ns Ic updates
.Pq Ic in Ns | Ns Ic out
.Ar file Op Ar timeout
.Xc
Dump the RIB, a.k.a. the
.Em routing information base ,
and all BGP messages in Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT) format.
It is possible to dump alternate RIB with the use of
.Ar name .
.Pp
For example, the following will dump the entire table to the
.Xr strftime 3 Ns -expanded
filename.
Only the
.Ic table-v2
format is able to dump a multi-protocol RIB correctly.
Both
.Ic table
and
.Ic table-mp
formats are more or less limited when handling multi-protocol entries and
are only left around to support 3rd party tools not handling the new format.
The timeout is optional:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dump table "/tmp/rib-dump-%H%M" 300
.Ed
.Pp
Similar to the table dump, but this time all
BGP messages and
.Em state transitions
will be dumped to the specified file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dump all in "/tmp/all-in-%H%M" 300
.Ed
.Pp
As before, but only the
.Em UPDATE
messages will be dumped to the file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dump updates in "/tmp/updates-in-%H%M" 300
.Ed
.Pp
It is also possible to dump outgoing messages:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dump all out "/tmp/all-out-%H%M" 300
# or
dump updates out "/tmp/updates-out-%H%M" 300
.Ed
.Pp
.It Ic fib-priority Ar prio
Set the routing priority to
.Ar prio .
The default is 48.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic fib-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
do not update the Forwarding Information Base, a.k.a. the kernel
routing table.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Ic holdtime Ar seconds
Set the holdtime in seconds.
The holdtime is reset to its initial value every time either a
.Em KEEPALIVE
or an
.Em UPDATE
message is received from the neighbor.
If the holdtime expires the session is dropped.
The default is 90 seconds.
Neighboring systems negotiate the holdtime used when the connection is
established in the
.Em OPEN
messages.
Each neighbor announces its configured holdtime; the smaller one is
then agreed upon.
.Pp
.It Ic holdtime min Ar seconds
The minimal accepted holdtime in seconds.
This value must be greater than or equal to 3.
.Pp
.It Ic listen on Ar address
Specify the local IP address
.Xr bgpd 8
should listen on.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listen on 127.0.0.1
.Ed
.Pp
.It Ic log updates
Log received and sent updates.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic nexthop
.Ic qualify
.Ic via
.Pq Ic bgp Ns | Ns Ic default
.Xc
If set to
.Ic bgp ,
.Xr bgpd 8
may use BGP routes to verify nexthops.
If set to
.Ic default ,
bgpd may use the default route to verify nexthops.
By default bgpd will only use static routes or routes added by other routing
daemons like
.Xr ospfd 8 .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic rde
.Ic med
.Ic compare
.Pq Ic always Ns | Ns Ic strict
.Xc
If set to
.Ic always ,
the
.Em MULTI_EXIT_DISC
attributes will always be compared.
The default is
.Ic strict ,
where the metric is only compared between peers belonging to the same AS.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic rde
.Ic rib Ar name
.Op Ic no Ic evaluate
.Xc
.It Xo
.Ic rde
.Ic rib Ar name
.Op Ic rtable Ar number
.Xc
Create an additional RIB named
.Ar name .
It is possible to disable the decision process per RIB with the
.Ic no Ic evaluate
flag.
If a
.Ic rtable
is specified, routes will be exported to the given kernel routing table.
Currently the routing table must belong to the routing domain
.Xr bgpd 8
was started in.
Nexthop verification happens in the table
.Xr bgpd 8
was started in - routes in the specified table will not be considered.
.Ic Adj-RIB-In
and
.Ic Loc-RIB
are created automatically and used as default.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic rde
.Ic route-age
.Pq Ic ignore Ns | Ns Ic evaluate
.Xc
If set to
.Ic evaluate ,
the best path selection will not only be based on the path attributes but
also on the age of the route, giving preference to the older, typically
more stable, route.
In this case the decision process is no longer deterministic.
The default is
.Ic ignore .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic route-collector
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
the route selection process is turned off.
The default is
.Ic no .
.Pp
.It Ic router-id Ar address
Set the router ID to the given IP address, which must be local to the
machine.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
router-id 10.0.0.1
.Ed
.Pp
If not given, the BGP ID is determined as the biggest IP address assigned
to the local machine.
.Pp
.It Ic rtable Ar number
Work with the given kernel routing table
instead of the default table, which is the one
.Xr bgpd 8
was started in.
For nexthop verification,
.Xr bgpd 8
will always consult the default table.
This is the same as using the following syntax:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rde rib Loc-RIB rtable number
.Ed
.Pp
.It Ic socket Qo Ar path Qc Op Ic restricted
Create a control socket at
.Ar path .
If
.Ic restricted
is specified a restricted control socket will be created.
By default
.Pa /var/run/bgpd.sock.<rdomain>
is used where
.Ar <rdomain>
is the routing domain in which bgpd has been started.
By default, no restricted socket is created.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic transparent-as
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
.Em AS paths
to EBGP neighbors are not prepended with the local AS.
The default is
.Ic no .
.El
.Sh SET CONFIGURATION
.Xr bgpd 8
supports sets for looking up collections in an efficent way.
.Ic as-set ,
.Ic prefix-set ,
and
.Ic origin-set
are used to look up AS numbers, prefixes and prefixes/source-as pairs
respectively.
See also the
.Sx FILTER
section on how these sets are used in filters.
One single
.Ic roa-set
can be defined which will be used to validate the origin of each prefix
against.
The set collections can span multiple lines and an optional comma is allowed
between elements.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic as-set Ar name
.Ic { Ar as-number ... Ic }
.Xc
An
.Ic as-set
holds a collection of AS numbers and can be used with the AS specific
parameter in
.Sx FILTER
rules.
Lookups against as-sets are more efficient than a large number of rules
which differ only in the AS number.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic origin-set Ar name
.Ic { Ar address Ns Li / Ns Ar len Ic maxlen Ar mlen Ic source-as Ar asn ... Ic }
.Xc
An
.Ic origin-set
holds a collection of prefix/source-as pairs and can be used in place
where a rules filter for source-as and prefix at the same time.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
origin-set private { 10.0.0.0/8 maxlen 24 source-as 64511
	203.0.113.0/24 source-as 64496 }
.Ed
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic prefix-set Ar name
.Ic { Ar address Ns Li / Ns Ar len ... Ic }
.Xc
A
.Ic prefix-set
holds a collection of prefixes and can be used in place
of the
.Ic prefix
parameter in
.Sx FILTER
rules and
.Ic network
statements.
Lookups against prefix-sets are more efficient than a large number of rules
which differ only in prefix.
.Pp
A prefix can be followed by the prefixlen operators listed for the
.Ic prefix
parameter in the
.Sx PARAMETERS
section.
.Pp
The first example creates a set of prefixes called
.Dq private ,
to hold a number of RFC 1918 private network blocks.
The second example shows the use of prefixlen operators.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
prefix-set private { 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12,
			192.168.0.0/16, fc00::/7 }
prefix-set as64496set { 192.0.2.0/24 prefixlen >= 26,
			2001:db8::/32 or-longer }
.Ed
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic roa-set
.Ic { Ar address Ns Li / Ns Ar len Ic maxlen Ar mlen Ic source-as Ar asn ... Ic }
.Xc
An
.Ic roa-set
holds a collection of Validated ROA Payloads (VRP).
Each received prefix is checked against the
.Ic roa-set
and the Origin Validation State (OVS) is set.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
roa-set { 192.0.2.0/24 maxlen 24 source-as 64511
	203.0.113.0/24 source-as 64496 }
.Ed
.El
.Sh NETWORK ANNOUNCEMENTS
To announce a specific network as belonging to our AS, a
.Ic network
statement is used.
By default
.Xr bgpd 8
will not announce anything.
Filter rules need to be in place to allow announcement of the right prefixes
to each neighbor.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic network
.Ar address Ns Li / Ns Ar prefix
.Op Ic set ...\&
.Xc
Announce the specified prefix as belonging to our AS.
.Pp
.It Xo

.Ic connected Op Ic set ...\&
.Xc
Announce routes to directly attached networks.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic network prefix-set

.Xc
All networks in the prefix-set
.Ar name
will be announced.
.Pp
.It Xo

.Xc
Announce routes with the specified
.Ar label .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic network
.Pq Ic inet Ns | Ns Ic inet6
.Ic static Op Ic set ...\&
.Xc
Announce all static routes.
.El
.Pp
It is possible to set default
.Em AS path attributes
per
.Ic network
statement:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
network 192.168.7.0/24 set localpref 220
.Ed
.Pp
See also the
.Sx ATTRIBUTE SET
section.
.Sh MPLS VPN CONFIGURATION
.Xr bgpd 8
supports the setup and distribution of MPLS Virtual Private Networks.
A router can be configured to participate in a VPN by specifying a
.Ic vpn
section with a description for the VPN and an
.Xr mpe 4
interface.
.Pp
The vpn configuration section allows properties to be set specifically
for that VPN:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
vpn "description" on mpe1 {
	rd 65002:1
	import-target rt 65002:42
	export-target rt 65002:42
	network 192.168.1/24
}
.Ed
.Pp
The description is used when logging but has no further meaning to
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.Pp
The
.Xr mpe 4
interface will be used as the outgoing interface for routes to
the VPN, and local networks will be annouced with the MPLS label
specified on the interface.
The interface can provide VPN connectivity for another rdomain by
being configured in that rdomain.
The required rdomain must be configured on the interface before
.Xr bgpd 8
uses it.
Multiple VPNs may be connected to a single rdomain, including the rdomain that
.Xr bgpd 8
is running in.
.Pp
An example
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration for an
.Xr mpe 4
interface providing connectivity to rdomain 1:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rdomain 1
mplslabel 2000
inet 192.198.0.1 255.255.255.255
up
.Ed
.Pp
There are several VPN properties:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic export-target Ar subtype Ar as-number : Ns Ar local
.It Ic export-target Ar subtype Ar IP : Ns Ar local
Specify an extended community which will be attached to announced networks.
More than one
.Ic export-target
can be specified.
See also the
.Sx ATTRIBUTE SET
section for further information about the encoding.
The
.Ar subtype
should be set to
.Ar rt
for best compatibility with other implementations.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic fib-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
do not update the Forwarding Information Base, a.k.a. the kernel
routing table.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Ic import-target Ar subtype Ar as-number : Ns Ar local
.It Ic import-target Ar subtype Ar IP : Ns Ar local
Only prefixes matching one of the specified
.Ic import-targets
will be imported into the rdomain.
More than one
.Ic import-target
can be specified.
See also the
.Sx ATTRIBUTE SET
section for further information about the encoding of extended communities.
The
.Ar subtype
should be set to
.Ar rt
for best compatibility with other implementations.
.Pp
.It Ic network Ar arguments ...
Define which networks should be exported into this VPN.
See also the
.Ic nexthop
section in
.Sx GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
for further information about the arguments.
.Pp
.It Ic rd Ar as-number : Ns Ar local
.It Ic rd Ar IP : Ns Ar local
The sole purpose of the Route Distinguisher
.Ic rd
is to ensure that possible common prefixes are distinct between VPNs.
The
.Ic rd
is neither used to identify the origin of the prefix nor to control into
which VPNs the prefix is distributed to.
The
.Ar as-number
or
.Ar IP
of a
.Ic rd
should be set to a number or IP that was assigned by an appropriate authority.
Whereas
.Ar local
can be chosen by the local operator.
.El
.Sh NEIGHBORS AND GROUPS
.Xr bgpd 8
establishes TCP connections to other BGP speakers called
.Em neighbors .
Each neighbor is specified by a
.Ic neighbor
section, which allows properties to be set specifically for that neighbor:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
neighbor 10.0.0.2 {
	remote-as 65002
	descr "a neighbor"
}
.Ed
.Pp
Multiple neighbors can be grouped together by a
.Ic group
section.
Each
.Ic neighbor
section within the
.Ic group
section inherits all properties from its group:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
group "peering AS65002" {
	remote-as 65002
	neighbor 10.0.0.2 {
		descr "AS65002-p1"
	}
	neighbor 10.0.0.3 {
		descr "AS65002-p2"
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
Instead of the neighbor's IP address, an address/netmask pair may be given:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
neighbor 10.0.0.0/8
.Ed
.Pp
In this case, the neighbor specification becomes a
.Em template ,
and if a neighbor connects from an IP address within the given network,
the template is
.Em cloned ,
inheriting everything from the template but the remote address, which is
replaced by the connecting neighbor's address.
With a template specification it is valid to omit
.Ic remote-as ;
.Xr bgpd 8
will then accept any AS the neighbor presents in the
.Em OPEN
message.
.Pp
There are several neighbor properties:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic announce
.Pq Ic IPv4 Ns | Ns Ic IPv6
.Pq Ic none Ns | Ns Ic unicast Ns | Ns Ic vpn
.Xc
For the given address family, control which subsequent address families
are announced during the capabilities negotiation.
Only routes for that address family and subsequent address families will be
announced and processed.
.Pp
At the moment, only
.Em none ,
which disables the announcement of that address family,
.Em unicast ,
and
.Em vpn ,
which allows the distribution of BGP MPLS VPNs, are supported.
.Pp
The default is
.Ic unicast
for the same address family of the session.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic announce as-4byte
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
the 4-byte AS capability is not announced and so native 4-byte AS support is
disabled.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic announce capabilities
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
capability negotiation is disabled during the establishment of the session.
This can be helpful to connect to old or broken BGP implementations.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic announce refresh
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
the route refresh capability is not announced.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic announce restart
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
the graceful restart capability is not announced.
Currently only the End-of-RIB marker is supported and announced by the
.Ic restart
capability.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic as-override
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
all occurrences of the neighbor AS in the
.Em AS path
will be replaced with the local AS before running the filters.
The Adj-RIB-In still holds the unmodified AS path.
The default value is
.Ic no .
.Pp
.It Ic demote Ar group
Increase the
.Xr carp 4
demotion counter on the given interface group, usually
.Ar carp ,
when the session is not in state
.Em ESTABLISHED .
The demotion counter will be increased as soon as
.Xr bgpd 8
starts and decreased
60 seconds after the session went to state
.Em ESTABLISHED .
For neighbors added at runtime, the demotion counter is only increased after
the session has been
.Em ESTABLISHED
at least once before dropping.
.Pp
For more information on interface groups,
see the
.Ic group
keyword in
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
.It Ic depend on Ar interface
The neighbor session will be kept in state
.Em IDLE
as long as
.Ar interface
reports no link.
For
.Xr carp 4
interfaces, no link means that the interface is currently
.Em backup .
This is primarily intended to be used with
.Xr carp 4
to reduce failover times.
.Pp
The state of the network interfaces on the system can be viewed
using the
.Cm show interfaces
command to
.Xr bgpctl 8 .
.Pp
.It Ic descr Ar description
Add a description.
The description is used when logging neighbor events, in status
reports, for specifying neighbors, etc., but has no further meaning to
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.Pp
.It Ic down Op Ar reason
Do not start the session when bgpd comes up but stay in
.Em IDLE .
If the session is cleared at runtime, after a
.Ic down
.Ar reason
was configured at runtime, the
.Ar reason
is sent as Administrative Shutdown Communication.
The
.Ar reason
cannot exceed 128 octets.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic dump
.Pq Ic all Ns | Ns Ic updates
.Pq Ic in Ns | Ns Ic out
.Ar file Op Ar timeout
.Xc
Do a peer specific MRT dump.
Peer specific dumps are limited to
.Ic all
and
.Ic updates .
See also the
.Ic dump
section in
.Sx GLOBAL CONFIGURATION .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic enforce local-as
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
.Em AS paths
will not be checked for AS loop detection.
This feature is similar to allowas-in in some other BGP implementations.
Since there is no AS path loop check, this feature is dangerous, and
requires you to add filters to prevent receiving your own prefixes.
The default value is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic enforce neighbor-as
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
.Em AS paths
whose
.Em leftmost AS
is not equal to the
.Em remote AS
of the neighbor are rejected and a
.Em NOTIFICATION
is sent back.
The default value for IBGP peers is
.Ic no
otherwise the default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic export
.Sm off
.Pq Ic none | default-route
.Sm on
.Xc
If set to
.Ic none ,
no
.Em UPDATE
messages will be sent to the neighbor.
If set to
.Ic default-route ,
only the default route will be announced to the neighbor.
When
.Ic export
is modified the neighbor session needs to be reset to become active.
.Pp
.It Ic holdtime Ar seconds
Set the holdtime in seconds.
Inherited from the global configuration if not given.
.Pp
.It Ic holdtime min Ar seconds
Set the minimal acceptable holdtime.
Inherited from the global configuration if not given.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic ipsec

.Ar authspec
specifies the authentication algorithm and key.
It can be
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sha1 <key>
md5 <key>
.Ed
.Pp
.Ar encspec
specifies the encryption algorithm and key.

.Ic ipsec
.Pq Ic ah Ns | Ns Ic esp
.Ic ike
.Xc
Enable IPsec with dynamic keying.
In this mode,
.Xr bgpd 8
sets up the flows, and a key management daemon such as
.Xr isakmpd 8
is responsible for managing the session keys.
With
.Xr isakmpd 8 ,
it is sufficient to copy the peer's public key, found in
.Pa /etc/isakmpd/local.pub ,
to the local machine.
It must be stored in a file
named after the peer's IP address and must be stored in
.Pa /etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/ipv4/ .
The local public key must be copied to the peer in the same way.
As
.Xr bgpd 8
manages the flows on its own, it is sufficient to restrict
.Xr isakmpd 8
to only take care of keying by specifying the flags
.Fl Ka .
This can be done in
.Xr rc.conf.local 8 .
After starting the
.Xr isakmpd 8
and
.Xr bgpd 8
daemons on both sides, the session should be established.
After changing settings a session needs to be reset to use the new keys.
.Pp
.It Ic local-address Ar address
When
.Xr bgpd 8
initiates the TCP connection to the neighbor system, it normally does not
bind to a specific IP address.
If a
.Ic local-address
is given,
.Xr bgpd 8
binds to this address first.
.Pp
.It Ic local-as Ar as-number Op Ar as-number
Set the AS number sent to the remote system.
Used as described above under
.Sx GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
option
.Ic AS .
.Pp
Since there is no AS path loop check, this option is dangerous, and
requires you to add filters to prevent receiving your ASNs.
Intended to be used temporarily, for migrations to another AS.

Disable neighbor specific logging.
.Pp
.It Ic log updates
Log received and sent updates for this neighbor.
.Pp

(no such limit is imposed by default).
If
.Ic restart
is specified, the session will be restarted after
.Ar number
minutes.
.Pp
.It Ic multihop Ar hops
Neighbors not in the same AS as the local
.Xr bgpd 8
normally have to be directly connected to the local machine.
If this is not the case, the
.Ic multihop
statement defines the maximum hops the neighbor may be away.
.Pp
.It Ic passive
Do not attempt to actively open a TCP connection to the neighbor system.

.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic ttl-security
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
Enable or disable ttl-security.
When enabled,
outgoing packets are sent using a TTL of 255
and a check is made against an incoming packet's TTL.
For directly connected peers,
incoming packets are required to have a TTL of 255,
ensuring they have not been routed.
For multihop peers,
incoming packets are required to have a TTL of 256 minus multihop distance,
ensuring they have not passed through more than the expected number of hops.

may also be modified by filter rules.
.Pp
For each
.Em UPDATE
processed by the filter, the filter rules are evaluated in sequential order,
from first to last.
The last matching

rule decides what action is taken.
The default action is to deny.
.Pp
The following actions can be used in the filter:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxx
.It Ic allow
The

.It Ic deny
The
.Em UPDATE
is blocked.
.It Ic match
Apply the filter attribute set without influencing the filter decision.
.El
.Sh PARAMETERS
The rule parameters specify the
