.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm OpenSSL
is a cryptography toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) network protocols and
related cryptography standards required by them.
.Pp
The
.Nm
program is a command line tool for using the various
cryptography functions of
.Nm OpenSSL Ns Li 's
.Em crypto
library from the shell. 
It can be used for 
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Creation of RSA, DH and DSA key parameters
.It
Creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs 
.It
Calculation of Message Digests
.It

.It
SSL/TLS Client and Server Tests
.It

.El
.Sh COMMAND SUMMARY
The
.Nm
program provides a rich variety of commands
.Po Cm command\ \&
in the
.Sx SYNOPSIS
above
.Pc ,
each of which often has a wealth of options and arguments
.Po Ar command_opts\ \&
and
.Ar command_args
in the
.Sx SYNOPSIS
.Pc .
.Pp
The pseudo-commands
.Cm list-standard-commands , list-message-digest-commands ,
and
.Cm list-cipher-commands
output a list (one entry per line) of the names
of all standard commands, message digest commands, or cipher commands,
respectively, that are available in the present
.Nm
utility.
.Pp
The pseudo-command
.Cm no- Ns Ar XXX
tests whether a command of the
specified name is available.
If no command named
.Ar XXX
exists,
it returns 0 (success) and prints
.Cm no- Ns Ar XXX ;
otherwise it returns 1 and prints
.Ar XXX .
In both cases, the output goes to
.Em stdout
and nothing is printed to
.Em stderr .
Additional command line arguments are always ignored.
Since for each cipher there is a command of the same name,
this provides an easy way for shell scripts to test for the
availability of ciphers in the
.Nm
program.
.Pp
.Sy Note:
.Cm no- Ns Ar XXX
is not able to detect pseudo-commands such as
.Cm quit ,
.Cm list- Ns Ar ... Ns Cm -commands ,
or
.Cm no- Ns Ar XXX
itself.

.El
.Sh PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
Several commands accept password arguments, typically using
.Fl passin
and
.Fl passout
for input and output passwords, respectively.
These allow the password to be obtained from a variety of sources.
Both of these options take a single argument whose format is described below.
If no password argument is given and a password is required then the user is
prompted to enter one: this will typically be read from the current
terminal with echoing turned off.
.Bl -tag -width "fd:number"
.It Ar pass:password
The actual password is
.Ar password .
Since the password is visible to utilities
(like
.Xr ps 1
under Unix) this form should only be used where security is not important.
.It Ar env:var
Obtain the password from the environment variable
.Ar var .
Since the environment of other processes is visible on certain platforms
(e.g.
.Xr ps 1
under certain Unix OSes) this option should be used with caution.
.It Ar file:pathname
The first line of
.Ar pathname
is the password.
If the same
.Ar pathname
argument is supplied to
.Fl passin
and
.Fl passout
then the first line will be used for the input password and the next line
for the output password.
.Ar pathname
need not refer to a regular file:
it could, for example, refer to a device or named pipe.
.It Ar fd:number
Read the password from the file descriptor
.Ar number .
This can be used to send the data via a pipe for example.
.It Ar stdin
Read the password from standard input.
.\"
.\" ASN1PARSE

.Sh ASN1PARSE
.Pp
.Nm "openssl asn1parse"
.Op Fl inform Ar PEM|DER
.Op Fl in Ar filename
.Op Fl out Ar filename
.Op Fl noout
.Op Fl offset Ar number
.Op Fl length Ar number
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl oid Ar filename
.Op Fl strparse Ar offset
.Pp
The
.Nm asn1parse
command is a diagnostic utility that can parse ASN.1 structures.
It can also be used to extract data from ASN.1 formatted data.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl inform Ar DER|PEM
The input format.
.Ar DER
is binary format and
.Ar PEM
(the default) is base64 encoded.
.It Fl in Ar filename
The input file; default is standard input.
.It Fl out Ar filename
Output file to place the
.Em DER
encoded data into.
If this option is not present then no data will be output.
This is most useful when combined with the
.Fl strparse
option.
.It Fl noout
Don't output the parsed version of the input file.
.It Fl offset Ar number
Starting offset to begin parsing; default is start of file.
.It Fl length Ar number
Number of bytes to parse; default is until end of file.
.It Fl i
Indents the output according to the "depth" of the structures.
.It Fl oid Ar filename
A file containing additional OBJECT IDENTIFIERs (OIDs).
The format of this file is described in the
.Sx ASN1PARSE NOTES
section below.
.It Fl strparse Ar offset
Parse the contents octets of the ASN.1 object starting at
.Ar offset .
This option can be used multiple times to "drill down" into a nested structure.
.Sh ASN1PARSE OUTPUT
The output will typically contain lines like this:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
  0:d=0  hl=4 l= 681 cons: SEQUENCE
.Pp
\&.....
.Pp
  229:d=3  hl=3 l= 141 prim: BIT STRING        
  373:d=2  hl=3 l= 162 cons: cont [ 3 ]        
  376:d=3  hl=3 l= 159 cons: SEQUENCE          
  379:d=4  hl=2 l=  29 cons: SEQUENCE          
  381:d=5  hl=2 l=   3 prim: OBJECT            :X509v3 Subject Key Identifier
  386:d=5  hl=2 l=  22 prim: OCTET STRING      
  410:d=4  hl=2 l= 112 cons: SEQUENCE          
  412:d=5  hl=2 l=   3 prim: OBJECT            :X509v3 Authority Key Identifier
  417:d=5  hl=2 l= 105 prim: OCTET STRING      
  524:d=4  hl=2 l=  12 cons: SEQUENCE
.Pp
\&.....
.Ed
.Pp
This example is part of a self-signed certificate.
Each line starts with the offset in decimal.
.Cm d=XX
specifies the current depth.
The depth is increased within the scope of any SET or SEQUENCE.
.Cm hl=XX
gives the header length (tag and length octets) of the current type.
.Cm l=XX
gives the length of the contents octets.
.Pp
The
.Fl i
option can be used to make the output more readable.
.Pp
Some knowledge of the ASN.1 structure is needed to interpret the output. 
.Pp
In this example the BIT STRING at offset 229 is the certificate public key.
The contents octets of this will contain the public key information.
This can be examined using the option
.Fl strparse Cm 229
to yield:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\&    0:d=0  hl=3 l= 137 cons: SEQUENCE          
\&    3:d=1  hl=3 l= 129 prim: INTEGER           :E5D21E1F5C8D208EA7A2166C7FAF9F6BDF2059669C60876DDB70840F1A5AAFA59699FE471F379F1DD6A487E7D5409AB6A88D4A9746E24B91D8CF55DB3521015460C8EDE44EE8A4189F7A7BE77D6CD3A9AF2696F486855CF58BF0EDF2B4068058C7A947F52548DDF7E15E96B385F86422BEA9064A3EE9E1158A56E4A6F47E5897
\&  135:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim: INTEGER           :010001
.Sh ASN1PARSE NOTES
If an OID is not part of
.Nm OpenSSL Ns Li 's
internal table it will be represented in
numerical form (for example 1.2.3.4).
The file passed to the
.Fl oid
option allows additional OIDs to be included.
Each line consists of three columns,
the first column is the OID in numerical format and should be followed by
whitespace.
The second column is the "short name" which is a single word followed
by whitespace.
The final column is the rest of the line and is the "long name".
.Nm asn1parse
displays the long name.
Example:
.Pp
"1.2.3.4	shortName	A long name"
.Sh ASN1PARSE BUGS
There should be options to change the format of input lines.
The output of some ASN.1 types is not well handled (if at all).

The
.Nm ca
command is a minimal CA application.
It can be used to sign certificate requests in a variety of forms
and generate CRLs.
It also maintains a text database of issued certificates and their status.
.Pp
The options descriptions will be divided into each purpose.
.Sh CA OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl config Ar filename
Specifies the configuration file to use.
.It Fl name Ar section
Specifies the configuration file
.Ar section
to use (overrides
.Cm default_ca
in the
.Cm ca
section).
.It Fl in Ar filename
An input
.Ar filename
containing a single certificate request to be signed by the CA.
.It Fl ss_cert Ar filename
A single self-signed certificate to be signed by the CA.
.It Fl spkac Ar filename
A file containing a single Netscape signed public key and challenge,
and additional field values to be signed by the CA.
See the
.Sx CA NOTES
section for information on the required format.
.It Fl infiles
If present, this should be the last option; all subsequent arguments
are assumed to be the names of files containing certificate requests. 
.It Fl out Ar filename
The output file to output certificates to.
The default is standard output.
The certificate details will also be printed out to this file.
.It Fl outdir Ar directory
The
.Ar directory
to output certificates to.
The certificate will be written to a filename consisting of the
serial number in hex with ".pem" appended.
.It Fl cert
The CA certificate file.
.It Fl keyfile Ar filename
The private key to sign requests with.
.It Fl key Ar password
The password used to encrypt the private key.
Since on some systems the command line arguments are visible
(e.g. Unix with the
.Xr ps 1
utility) this option should be used with caution.
.It Fl passin Ar arg
The key password source.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl verbose
This prints extra details about the operations being performed.
.It Fl notext
Don't output the text form of a certificate to the output file.
.It Fl startdate Ar date
This allows the start date to be explicitly set.
The format of the date is YYMMDDHHMMSSZ
(the same as an ASN1 UTCTime structure).
.It Fl enddate Ar date
This allows the expiry date to be explicitly set.
The format of the date is YYMMDDHHMMSSZ
(the same as an ASN1 UTCTime structure).
.It Fl days Ar arg
The number of days to certify the certificate for.
.It Fl md Ar alg
The message digest to use.
Possible values include
.Ar md5 , sha1
and
.Ar mdc2 .
This option also applies to CRLs.
.It Fl policy Ar arg
This option defines the CA "policy" to use.
This is a section in the configuration file which decides which fields
should be mandatory or match the CA certificate.
Check out the
.Sx CA POLICY FORMAT
section for more information.
.It Fl msie_hack
This is a legacy option to make
.Nm ca
work with very old versions of the IE certificate enrollment control
"certenr3".
It used UniversalStrings for almost everything.
Since the old control has various security bugs,
its use is strongly discouraged.
The newer control "Xenroll" does not need this option.
.It Fl preserveDN
Normally the DN order of a certificate is the same as the order of the
fields in the relevant policy section.
When this option is set, the order is the same as the request.
This is largely for compatibility with the older IE enrollment control
which would only accept certificates if their DNs matched the order of the
request.
This is not needed for Xenroll.
.It Fl noemailDN
The DN of a certificate can contain the EMAIL field if present in the
request DN, however it is good policy just having the e-mail set into
the
.Em altName
extension of the certificate.
When this option is set the EMAIL field is removed from the certificate's
subject and set only in the, eventually present, extensions.
The
.Ar email_in_dn
keyword can be used in the configuration file to enable this behaviour.
.It Fl batch
This sets the batch mode.
In this mode no questions will be asked
and all certificates will be certified automatically.
.It Fl extensions Ar section
The section of the configuration file containing certificate extensions
to be added when a certificate is issued (defaults to
.Em x509_extensions
unless the
.Fl extfile
option is used).
If no extension section is present, then a V1 certificate is created.
If the extension section is present (even if it is empty),
then a V3 certificate is created.
.It Fl extfile Ar file
An additional configuration
.Ar file
to read certificate extensions from
(using the default section unless the
.Fl extensions
option is also used).
.El
.Sh CRL OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl gencrl
This option generates a CRL based on information in the index file.
.It Fl crldays Ar num
The number of days before the next CRL is due.
This is the days from now to place in the CRL
.Em nextUpdate
field.
.It Fl crlhours Ar num
The number of hours before the next CRL is due.
.It Fl revoke Ar filename
A
.Ar filename
containing a certificate to revoke.
.It Fl subj Ar arg
Supersedes the subject name given in the request.
The
.Ar arg
must be formatted as
.Ar /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=... ;
characters may be escaped by \e (backslash), no spaces are skipped.
.It Fl crlexts Ar section
The
.Ar section
of the configuration file containing CRL extensions to include.
If no CRL extension section is present then a V1 CRL is created;
if the CRL extension section is present (even if it is empty)
then a V2 CRL is created.
The CRL extensions specified are CRL extensions and
.Em not
CRL entry extensions.
It should be noted that some software (for example Netscape)
can't handle V2 CRLs. 
.El
.Sh CA CONFIGURATION FILE OPTIONS
The section of the configuration file containing options for
.Nm ca
is found as follows:
If the
.Fl name
command line option is used, then it names the section to be used.
Otherwise the section to be used must be named in the
.Em default_ca
option of the
.Em ca
section of the configuration file (or in the default section of the
configuration file).
Besides
.Em default_ca ,
the following options are read directly from the
.Em ca
section:
.Pp
  RANDFILE
  preserve
  msie_hack
.Pp
With the exception of RANDFILE, this is probably a bug and may
change in future releases.
.Pp
Many of the configuration file options are identical to command line
options.
Where the option is present in the configuration file and the command line,
the command line value is used.
Where an option is described as mandatory, then it must be present in
the configuration file or the command line equivalent (if any) used.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar oid_file
This specifies a file containing additional OBJECT IDENTIFIERS.
Each line of the file should consist of the numerical form of the
object identifier followed by whitespace, then the short name followed
by whitespace and finally the long name. 
.It Ar oid_section
This specifies a section in the configuration file containing extra
object identifiers.
Each line should consist of the short name of the object identifier
followed by
.Cm =
and the numerical form.
The short and long names are the same when this option is used.
.It Ar new_certs_dir
The same as the
.Fl outdir
command line option.
It specifies the directory where new certificates will be placed.
Mandatory.
.It Ar certificate
The same as
.Fl cert.
It gives the file containing the CA certificate.
Mandatory.
.It Ar private_key
Same as the
.Fl keyfile
option.
The file containing the CA private key.
Mandatory.
.It Ar RANDFILE
A file used to read and write random number seed information,
or an EGD socket (see
.Xr RAND_egd 3 ) .
.It Ar default_days
The same as the
.Fl days
option.
The number of days to certify a certificate for. 
.It Ar default_startdate
The same as the
.Fl startdate
option.
The start date to certify a certificate for.
If not set, the current time is used.
.It Ar default_enddate
The same as the
.Fl enddate
option.
Either this option or
.Ar default_days
(or the command line equivalents) must be present.
.It Ar default_crl_hours default_crl_days
The same as the
.Fl crlhours
and the
.Fl crldays
options.
These will only be used if neither command line option is present.
At least one of these must be present to generate a CRL.
.It Ar default_md
The same as the
.Fl md
option.
The message digest to use.
Mandatory.
.It Ar database
The text database file to use.
Mandatory.
This file must be present, though initially it will be empty.
.It Ar serialfile
A text file containing the next serial number to use in hex.
Mandatory.
This file must be present and contain a valid serial number.
.It Ar x509_extensions
The same as
.Fl extensions .
.It Ar crl_extensions
the same as
.Fl crlexts .
.It Ar preserve
The same as
.Fl preserveDN .
.It Ar email_in_dn
The same as
.Fl noemailDN .
If the EMAIL field is to be removed from the DN of the certificate,
simply set this to 'no'.
If not present the default is to allow for the EMAIL field in the
certificate's DN.
.It Ar msie_hack
The same as
.Fl msie_hack .
.It Ar policy
The same as
.Fl policy .
Mandatory.
See the
.Sx CA POLICY FORMAT
section for more information.
.It Ar nameopt , certopt
These options allow the format used to display the certificate details
when asking the user to confirm signing.
All the options supported by the
.Nm x509
utilities'
.Fl nameopt
and
.Fl certopt
switches can be used here, except that
.Ar no_signame
and
.Ar no_sigdump
are permanently set and cannot be disabled
(this is because the certificate signature cannot be displayed because
the certificate has not been signed at this point).
.Pp
For convenience the values
.Em default_ca
are accepted by both to produce a reasonable output.
.Pp
If neither option is present the format used in earlier versions of
.Nm OpenSSL
is used.
Use of the old format is
.Em strongly
discouraged because it only displays fields mentioned in the
.Ar policy
section,
mishandles multicharacter string types and does not display extensions.
.It Ar copy_extensions
Determines how extensions in certificate requests should be handled.
If set to
.Ar none
or this option is not present, then extensions are
ignored and not copied to the certificate.
If set to
.Ar copy
then any extensions present in the request that are not already present
are copied to the certificate.
If set to
.Ar copyall
then all extensions in the request are copied to the certificate:
if the extension is already present in the certificate it is deleted first.
See the
.Sx CA WARNINGS
section before using this option.
.Pp
The main use of this option is to allow a certificate request to supply
values for certain extensions such as
.Em subjectAltName .
.El
.Sh CA POLICY FORMAT
The policy section consists of a set of variables corresponding to
certificate DN fields.
If the value is "match" then the field value
must match the same field in the CA certificate.
If the value is "supplied" then it must be present.
If the value is "optional" then it may be present.
Any fields not mentioned in the policy section
are silently deleted, unless the
.Fl preserveDN
option is set,
but this can be regarded more of a quirk than intended behaviour.
.Sh SPKAC FORMAT
The input to the
.Fl spkac
command line option is a Netscape signed public key and challenge.
This will usually come from the
.Em KEYGEN
tag in an HTML form to create a new private key. 
It is, however, possible to create SPKACs using the
.Nm spkac
utility.
.Pp
The file should contain the variable SPKAC set to the value of
the SPKAC and also the required DN components as name value pairs.
If it's necessary to include the same component twice then it can be
preceded by a number and a '.'.
.Sh CA EXAMPLES
.Sy Note:
these examples assume that the
.Nm ca
directory structure is already set up and the relevant files already exist.
This usually involves creating a CA certificate and private key with
.Cm req ,
a serial number file and an empty index file and placing them in
the relevant directories.
.Pp
To use the sample configuration file below, the directories
.Pa demoCA ,
.Pa demoCA/private
and
.Pa demoCA/newcerts
would be created.
The CA certificate would be copied to
.Pa demoCA/cacert.pem
and its private key to
.Pa demoCA/private/cakey.pem .
A file
.Pa demoCA/serial
would be created containing, for example, "01" and the empty index file
.Pa demoCA/index.txt .

.Sh CA WARNINGS
The
.Nm ca
command is quirky and at times downright unfriendly.
.Pp
The
.Nm ca
utility was originally meant as an example of how to do things in a CA.
It was not supposed to be used as a full blown CA itself;
nevertheless some people are using it for this purpose.
.Pp
The
.Nm ca
command is effectively a single user command: no locking is
done on the various files and attempts to run more than one
.Nm ca
command on the same database can have unpredictable results.
.Sh CA FILES
.Sy Note:
the location of all files can change either by compile time options,
configuration file entries, environment variables or command line options.
The values below reflect the default values.
.Pp

.Ed
.Sh CA ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.Em OPENSSL_CONF
reflects the location of the master configuration file;
it can be overridden by the
.Fl config
command line option.
.Sh CA RESTRICTIONS
The text database index file is a critical part of the process,
and if corrupted it can be difficult to fix.
It is theoretically possible to rebuild the index file from all the
issued certificates and a current CRL; however there is no option to do this.
.Pp
CRL entry extensions cannot currently be created; only CRL extensions
can be added.
.Pp
V2 CRL features like delta CRL support and CRL numbers are not currently
supported.
.Pp
Although several requests can be input and handled at once, it is only
possible to include one SPKAC or self-signed certificate.
.Sh CA BUGS
The use of an in-memory text database can cause problems when large
numbers of certificates are present because, as the name implies,
the database has to be kept in memory.
.Pp
It is not possible to certify two certificates with the same DN; this
is a side effect of how the text database is indexed and it cannot easily
be fixed without introducing other problems.
Some S/MIME clients can use two certificates with the same DN for separate
signing and encryption keys.
.Pp
The
.Nm ca
command really needs rewriting or the required functionality
exposed at either a command or interface level so a more friendly utility
(perl script or GUI) can handle things properly.
The scripts
.Nm CA.sh
and
.Nm CA.pl
help a little but not very much.
.Pp
Any fields in a request that are not present in a policy are silently
deleted.
This does not happen if the
.Fl preserveDN
option is used.
To enforce the absence of the EMAIL field within the DN, as suggested
by RFCs, regardless of the contents of the request's subject the
.Fl noemailDN
option can be used.
The behaviour should be more friendly and configurable.
.Pp
Cancelling some commands by refusing to certify a certificate can
create an empty file.
.Sh CA WARNINGS
The
.Ar copy_extensions
option should be used with caution.
If care is not taken then it can be a security risk.
For example, if a certificate request contains a
.Em basicConstraints
extension with CA:TRUE and the
.Ar copy_extensions
value is set to
.Ar copyall
and the user does not spot
this when the certificate is displayed, then this will hand the requestor
a valid CA certificate.
.Pp
This situation can be avoided by setting
.Ar copy_extensions
to
.Ar copy
and including
.Em basicConstraints
with CA:FALSE in the configuration file.
Then if the request contains a
.Em basicConstraints
extension, it will be ignored.
.Pp
It is advisable to also include values for other extensions such
as
.Ar keyUsage
to prevent a request supplying its own values.
.Pp
Additional restrictions can be placed on the CA certificate itself.
For example if the CA certificate has:
.Pp
\& basicConstraints = CA:TRUE, pathlen:0
.Pp
then even if a certificate is issued with CA:TRUE it will not be valid.

.Nm openssl ciphers
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl ssl2
.Op Fl ssl3
.Op Fl tls1
.Op Cm cipherlist
.Pp
The
.Nm cipherlist
command converts
.Nm OpenSSL
cipher lists into ordered SSL cipher preference lists.
It can be used as a test tool to determine the appropriate cipherlist.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width -Ds
.It Fl v
Verbose option.
List ciphers with a complete description of protocol version
(SSLv2 or SSLv3; the latter includes TLS), key exchange,
authentication, encryption and mac algorithms used along with any key size
restrictions and whether the algorithm is classed as an
.Em export
cipher.
Note that without the
.Fl v
option, ciphers may seem to appear twice in a cipher list;
this is when similar ciphers are available for
SSL v2 and for SSL v3/TLS v1.
.It Fl ssl3
Only include SSL v3 ciphers.
.It Fl ssl2
Only include SSL v2 ciphers.
.It Fl tls1
Only include TLS v1 ciphers.
.It Fl h , ?
Print a brief usage message.
.It Fl cipherlist
A cipher list to convert to a cipher preference list.
If it is not included, then the default cipher list will be used.
The format is described below.
.El
.Sh CIPHERS LIST FORMAT
The cipher list consists of one or more
.Em cipher strings
separated by colons.
Commas or spaces are also acceptable separators, but colons are normally used.
.Pp
The actual
.Em cipher string
can take several different forms:
.Pp
It can consist of a single cipher suite such as
.Em RC4-SHA .
.Pp
It can represent a list of cipher suites containing a certain algorithm,
or cipher suites of a certain type.
For example
.Em SHA1
represents all cipher suites using the digest algorithm SHA1, and
.Em SSLv3
represents all SSL v3 algorithms.
.Pp
Lists of cipher suites can be combined in a single
.Em cipher string
using the
.Cm +
character.
This is used as a logical
.Em and
operation.
For example,
.Em SHA1+DES
represents all cipher suites containing the SHA1 and the DES algorithms.
.Pp
Each cipher string can be optionally preceded by the characters
.Cm ! , -
or
.Cm + .
.Pp
If
.Cm !
is used, then the ciphers are permanently deleted from the list.
The ciphers deleted can never reappear in the list even if they are
explicitly stated.
.Pp
If
.Cm -
is used, then the ciphers are deleted from the list, but some or
all of the ciphers can be added again by later options.
.br
.Pp
If
.Cm +
is used, then the ciphers are moved to the end of the list.
This option doesn't add any new ciphers, it just moves matching existing ones.
.Pp
If none of these characters is present, then the string is just interpreted
as a list of ciphers to be appended to the current preference list.
If the list includes any ciphers already present they will be ignored;
that is, they will not be moved to the end of the list.
.Pp
Additionally the cipher string
.Em @STRENGTH
can be used at any point to sort the current cipher list in order of
encryption algorithm key length.
.Sh CIPHERS STRINGS
The following is a list of all permitted cipher strings and their meanings.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar DEFAULT
The default cipher list.
This is determined at compile time and is normally
.Ar ALL:!ADH:RC4+RSA:+SSLv2:@STRENGTH .
This must be the first
.Ar cipher string
specified.
.It Ar COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT
The ciphers included in
.Ar ALL ,
but not enabled by default.
Currently this is
.Ar ADH .
Note that this rule does not cover
.Ar eNULL ,
which is not included by
.Ar ALL
(use
.Ar COMPLEMENTOFALL
if necessary).
.It Ar ALL
All ciphers suites except the
.Ar eNULL
ciphers which must be explicitly enabled.
.It Ar COMPLEMENTOFALL
The cipher suites not enabled by
.Ar ALL ,
currently being
.Ar eNULL .
.It Ar HIGH
"High" encryption cipher suites.
This currently means those with key lengths larger than 128 bits.
.It Ar MEDIUM
"Medium" encryption cipher suites, currently those using 128 bit encryption.
.It Ar LOW
"Low" encryption cipher suites, currently those using 64 or 56 bit encryption
algorithms, but excluding export cipher suites.
.It Ar EXP , EXPORT
Export encryption algorithms.
Including 40 and 56 bits algorithms.
.It Ar EXPORT40
40 bit export encryption algorithms
.It Ar EXPORT56
56 bit export encryption algorithms.
.It Ar eNULL, NULL
The "NULL" ciphers; that is those offering no encryption.
Because these offer no encryption at all and are a security risk
they are disabled unless explicitly included.
.It Ar aNULL
The cipher suites offering no authentication.
This is currently the anonymous DH algorithms.
These cipher suites are vulnerable to a "man in the middle"
attack and so their use is normally discouraged.
.It Ar kRSA , RSA
Cipher suites using RSA key exchange.
.It Ar kEDH
Cipher suites using ephemeral DH key agreement.
.It Ar kDHr , kDHd
Cipher suites using DH key agreement and DH certificates signed by
CAs with RSA and DSS keys respectively.
Not implemented.
.It Ar aRSA
Cipher suites using RSA authentication, i.e. the certificates carry RSA keys.
.It Ar aDSS , DSS
Cipher suites using DSS authentication, i.e. the certificates carry DSS keys.
.It Ar aDH
Cipher suites effectively using DH authentication, i.e. the certificates carry
DH keys.
Not implemented.
.It Ar kFZA , aFZA , eFZA , FZA
Ciphers suites using FORTEZZA key exchange, authentication, encryption
or all FORTEZZA algorithms.
Not implemented.
.It Ar TLSv1 , SSLv3 , SSLv2
TLS v1.0, SSL v3.0 or SSL v2.0 cipher suites, respectively.
.It Ar DH

field.
.It Fl CAfile Ar file
Verify the signature on a CRL by looking up the issuing certificate in
.Ar file .
.It Fl CApath Ar dir
Verify the signature on a CRL by looking up the issuing certificate in
.Ar dir .
This directory must be a standard certificate directory,
i.e. a hash of each subject name (using
.Cm x509 Fl hash )
should be linked to each certificate.

command is used to manipulate DH parameter files.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl inform Ar DER|PEM
This specifies the input format.
The argument
.Ar DER
uses an ASN1 DER encoded form compatible with the PKCS#3 DHparameter
structure.
The

form is the default format:
it consists of the DER format base64 encoded with
additional header and footer lines.
.It Fl outform Ar DER|PEM
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the

option.
.It Fl in Ar filename
This specifies the input
.Ar filename
to read parameters from or standard input if this option is not specified.
.It Fl out Ar filename
This specifies the output
.Ar filename
to write parameters to.
Standard output is used if this option is not present.
The output filename should
.Em not
be the same as the input filename.
.It Fl dsaparam
If this option is used, DSA rather than DH parameters are read or created;
they are converted to DH format.
Otherwise, "strong" primes (such that (p-1)/2 is also prime)
will be used for DH parameter generation.
.Pp
DH parameter generation with the
.Fl dsaparam
option is much faster,
and the recommended exponent length is shorter,
which makes DH key exchange more efficient.
Beware that with such DSA-style DH parameters,
a fresh DH key should be created for each use to
avoid small-subgroup attacks that may be possible otherwise.
.It Fl 2 , 5

A password will be prompted for to derive the

if necessary.
.Pp
The
.Fl salt
option should
.Em ALWAYS
be used if the key is being derived from a password unless compatibility
with previous versions of
.Nm OpenSSL
and
.Nm SSLeay
is necessary.
.Pp
Without the
.Fl salt
option it is possible to perform efficient dictionary
attacks on the password and to attack stream cipher encrypted data.
The reason for this is that without the
.Ar salt
the same password always generates the same encryption key.
When the
.Ar salt
is being used the first eight bytes of the encrypted data are reserved
for the
.Ar salt :
it is generated at random when encrypting a file and read from the
encrypted file when it is decrypted.
.Pp
Some of the ciphers do not have large keys and others have security
implications if not used correctly.
A beginner is advised to just use a strong block cipher in CBC mode
such as bf or des3.
.Pp
All the block ciphers normally use PKCS#5 padding also known as standard block
padding:
this allows a rudimentary integrity or password check to be performed.
However, since the chance of random data passing the test is
better than 1 in 256, it isn't a very good test.
.Pp
If padding is disabled then the input data must be a multiple of the cipher
block length.
.Pp
All RC2 ciphers have the same key and effective key length.
.Pp
Blowfish and RC5 algorithms use a 128 bit key.

RSA private key generation essentially involves the generation of two prime
numbers.
When generating a private key, various symbols will be output to
indicate the progress of the generation.
A
.Em \&.
represents each number which has passed an initial sieve test,
.Em \&+
means a number has passed a single round of the Miller-Rabin primality test.
A newline means that the number has passed all the prime tests
(the actual number depends on the key size).
.Pp
Because key generation is a random process the time taken to generate a key
may vary somewhat.
.Sh GENRSA BUGS
A quirk of the prime generation algorithm is that it cannot generate small
primes.
Therefore the number of bits should not be less that 64.
For typical private keys this will not matter because for security reasons
they will be much larger (typically 1024 bits).

.Sy WARNING:
this documentation is preliminary and subject to change.
.Pp
The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) enables applications to
determine the (revocation) state of an identified certificate (RFC 2560).
.Pp
The
.Nm ocsp
command performs many common OCSP tasks.
It can be used to print out requests and responses,
create requests and send queries to an OCSP responder and behave like
a mini OCSP server itself.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl out Ar filename
Specify output
.Ar filename ,
default is standard output.
.It Fl issuer Ar filename
This specifies the current issuer certificate.
This option can be used multiple times.
The certificate specified in
.Ar filename
must be in
.Ar PEM
format.
.It Fl cert Ar filename
Add the certificate
.Ar filename
to the request.
The issuer certificate is taken from the previous
.Fl issuer
option, or an error occurs if no issuer certificate is specified.
.It Fl serial Ar num
Same as the
.Fl cert
option except the certificate with serial number
.Ar num
is added to the request.
The serial number is interpreted as a decimal integer unless preceded by
.Em 0x .
Negative integers can also be specified by preceding the value by a `-' sign.
.It Fl signer Ar filename , Fl signkey Ar filename
Sign the OCSP request using the certificate specified in the
.Fl signer
option and the private key specified by the
.Fl signkey
option.
If the
.Fl signkey
option is not present then the private key is read from the same file
as the certificate.
If neither option is specified then the OCSP request is not signed.
.It Fl nonce , no_nonce
Add an OCSP
.Em nonce
extension to a request or disable an OCSP
.Em nonce
addition.
Normally, if an OCSP request is input using the
.Fl respin
option no
.Em nonce
is added:
using the
.Fl nonce
option will force addition of a
.Em nonce .
If an OCSP request is being created (using the
.Fl cert
and
.Fl serial
options)
a
.Em nonce
is automatically added; specifying
.Fl no_nonce
overrides this.
.It Fl req_text , resp_text , text
Print out the text form of the OCSP request, response or both, respectively.
.It Fl reqout Ar file , Fl respout Ar file
Write out the DER encoded certificate request or response to
.Ar file .
.It Fl reqin Ar file , Fl respin Ar file
Read an OCSP request or response file from
.Ar file .
These option are ignored
if an OCSP request or response creation is implied by other options
(for example with the
.Fl serial , cert
and
.Fl host
options).
.It Fl url Ar responder_url
Specify the responder URL.
Both HTTP and HTTPS (SSL/TLS) URLs can be specified.
.It Fl host Ar hostname:port , Fl path Ar pathname
If the
.Fl host
option is present, then the OCSP request is sent to the host
.Ar hostname
on port
.Ar port .
.Fl path
specifies the HTTP path name to use, or "/" by default.
.It Fl CAfile Ar file , Fl CApath Ar pathname
.Ar file
or
.Ar pathname
containing trusted CA certificates.
These are used to verify the signature on the OCSP response.
.It Fl verify_certs Ar file
.Ar file
containing additional certificates to search when attempting to locate
the OCSP response signing certificate.
Some responders omit the actual signer's certificate from the response:
this option can be used to supply the necessary certificate in such cases.
.It Fl trust_other
The certificates specified by the
.Fl verify_certs
option should be explicitly trusted and no additional checks will be
performed on them.
This is useful when the complete responder certificate chain is not available
or trusting a root CA is not appropriate.
.It Fl VAfile Ar file
.Ar file
containing explicitly trusted responder certificates.
Equivalent to the
.Fl verify_certs
and
.Fl trust_other
options.
.It Fl noverify
Don't attempt to verify the OCSP response signature or the
.Em nonce
values.
This option will normally only be used for debugging
since it disables all verification of the responders certificate.
.It Fl no_intern
Ignore certificates contained in the OCSP response
when searching for the signer's certificate.
With this option the signer's certificate must be specified with either the
.Fl verify_certs
or
.Fl VAfile
options.
.It Fl no_sig_verify
Don't check the signature on the OCSP response.
Since this option tolerates invalid signatures on OCSP responses,
it will normally only be used for testing purposes.
.It Fl no_cert_verify
Don't verify the OCSP response signers certificate at all.
Since this option allows the OCSP response to be signed by any certificate,
it should only be used for testing purposes.
.It Fl no_chain
Do not use certificates in the response as additional untrusted CA
certificates.
.It Fl no_cert_checks
Don't perform any additional checks on the OCSP response signers certificate.
That is, do not make any checks to see if the signers certificate is authorised
to provide the necessary status information:
as a result this option should only be used for testing purposes.
.It Fl validity_period Ar nsec , Fl status_age Ar age
These options specify the range of times, in seconds, which will be tolerated
in an OCSP response.
Each certificate status response includes a
.Em notBefore
time and an optional
.Em notAfter
time.
The current time should fall between these two values,
but the interval between the two times may be only a few seconds.
In practice the OCSP responder and clients' clocks may not be precisely
synchronised and so such a check may fail.
To avoid this the
.Fl validity_period
option can be used to specify an acceptable error range in seconds,
the default value is 5 minutes.
.Pp
If the
.Em notAfter
time is omitted from a response then this means that new status
information is immediately available.
In this case the age of the
.Em notBefore
field is checked to see it is not older than
.Ar age
seconds old.
By default this additional check is not performed.

.Sh OCSP SERVER OPTIONS
.Pp
.Bl -tag -with DS
.It Fl index Ar indexfile
.Ar indexfile
is a text index file in

format containing certificate revocation information.
.Pp
If the
.Fl index
option is specified, the
.Nm ocsp

.Em responder
mode, otherwise it is in
.Em client

.Fl issuer
and
.Fl serial

.Fl respin
option) or via external OCSP clients (if
.Ar port
or
.Ar url
is specified).
.Pp
If the
.Fl index
option is present, then the
.Fl CA
and
.Fl rsigner
options must also be present.
.It Fl CA Ar file

.Ar indexfile .
.It Fl rsigner Ar file

.It Fl rother Ar file
Additional certificates to include in the OCSP response.
.It Fl resp_no_certs
Don't include any certificates in the OCSP response.
.It Fl resp_key_id
Identify the signer certificate using the key ID,
default is to use the subject name.
.It Fl rkey Ar file
The private key to sign OCSP responses with;
if not present the file specified in the
.Fl rsigner
option is used.
.It Fl port Ar portnum
Port to listen for OCSP requests on.
The port may also be specified using the

option.
.It Fl nrequest Ar number
The OCSP server will exit after receiving
.Ar number
requests, default unlimited. 
.It Fl nmin Ar minutes , Fl ndays Ar days
Number of
.Ar minutes
or

when fresh revocation information is available: used in the
.Ar nextUpdate
field.
If neither option is present then the
.Em nextUpdate
field is omitted meaning fresh revocation information is immediately available.
.El
.Sh OCSP RESPONSE VERIFICATION
OCSP Response follows the rules specified in RFC2560.
.Pp
Initially the OCSP responder certificate is located and the signature on
the OCSP request checked using the responder certificate's public key.
.Pp
Then a normal certificate verify is performed on the OCSP responder certificate
building up a certificate chain in the process.
The locations of the trusted certificates used to build the chain can be
specified by the
.Fl CAfile
and
.Fl CApath
options or they will be looked for in the standard
.Nm OpenSSL
certificates
directory.
.Pp
If the initial verify fails then the OCSP verify process halts with an
error.
.Pp
Otherwise the issuing CA certificate in the request is compared to the OCSP
responder certificate: if there is a match then the OCSP verify succeeds.
.Pp
Otherwise the OCSP responder certificate's CA is checked against the issuing
CA certificate in the request.
If there is a match and the OCSPSigning extended key usage is present
in the OCSP responder certificate, then the OCSP verify succeeds.
.Pp
Otherwise the root CA of the OCSP responders CA is checked to see if it
is trusted for OCSP signing.
If it is, the OCSP verify succeeds.
.Pp
If none of these checks is successful then the OCSP verify fails.
.Pp
What this effectively means is that if the OCSP responder certificate is
authorised directly by the CA it is issuing revocation information about
(and it is correctly configured) then verification will succeed.
.Pp
If the OCSP responder is a
.Em global responder
which can give details about multiple CAs and has its own separate
certificate chain, then its root CA can be trusted for OCSP signing.
For example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& $ openssl x509 -in ocspCA.pem -addtrust OCSPSigning -out trustedCA.pem
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively the responder certificate itself can be explicitly trusted
with the
.Fl VAfile
option.
.Sh OCSP NOTES
As noted, most of the verify options are for testing or debugging purposes.
Normally only the
.Fl CApath , CAfile
and (if the responder is a 'global VA')
.Fl VAfile
options need to be used.
.Pp
The OCSP server is only useful for test and demonstration purposes:
it is not really usable as a full OCSP responder.
It contains only a very simple HTTP request handling and can only handle
the POST form of OCSP queries.
It also handles requests serially, meaning it cannot respond to
new requests until it has processed the current one.
The text index file format of revocation is also inefficient for large
quantities of revocation data.
.Pp
It is possible to run the
.Nm ocsp
application in
.Em responder
mode via a CGI script using the
.Fl respin
and
.Fl respout
options.

The
.Nm pkcs8
command processes private keys in PKCS#8 format.
It can handle both unencrypted PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo format
and EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo format with a variety of PKCS#5
(v1.5 and v2.0) and PKCS#12 algorithms.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl topk8
Normally a PKCS#8 private key is expected on input and a traditional format
private key will be written.
With the
.Fl topk8
option the situation is reversed:
it reads a traditional format private key and writes a PKCS#8 format key.
.It Fl inform Ar DER|PEM
This specifies the input format.
If a PKCS#8 format key is expected on input,
then either a
.Em DER
or
.Em PEM
encoded version of a PKCS#8 key will be expected.
Otherwise the
.Em DER
or
.Em PEM
format of the traditional format private key is used.
.It Fl outform Ar DER|PEM
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
.Fl inform
option.
.It Fl in Ar filename
This specifies the input
.Ar filename
to read a key from or standard input if this option is not specified.
If the key is encrypted a pass phrase will be prompted for.
.It Fl passin Ar arg
The input file password source.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl out Ar filename
This specifies the output
.Ar filename
to write a key to or standard output by default.
If any encryption options are set then a pass phrase will be prompted for.
The output filename should
.Em not
be the same as the input filename.
.It Fl passout Ar arg
The output file password source.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl nocrypt
PKCS#8 keys generated or input are normally PKCS#8
.Em EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo
structures using an appropriate password based encryption algorithm.
With this option an unencrypted
.Em PrivateKeyInfo
structure is expected or output.
This option does not encrypt private keys at all and should only be used
when absolutely necessary.
Certain software such as some versions of Java code signing software used
unencrypted private keys.
.It Fl nooct
This option generates RSA private keys in a broken format that some software
uses.
Specifically the private key should be enclosed in a OCTET STRING,
but some software just includes the structure itself without the
surrounding OCTET STRING.
.It Fl embed
This option generates DSA keys in a broken format.
The DSA parameters are embedded inside the
.Em PrivateKey
structure.
In this form the OCTET STRING contains an ASN1 SEQUENCE consisting of
two structures:
a SEQUENCE containing the parameters and an ASN1 INTEGER containing
the private key.
.It Fl nsdb
This option generates DSA keys in a broken format compatible with Netscape
private key databases.
The
.Em PrivateKey
contains a SEQUENCE consisting of the public and private keys, respectively.
.It Fl v2 Ar alg
This option enables the use of PKCS#5 v2.0 algorithms.
Normally PKCS#8 private keys are encrypted with the password based
encryption algorithm called
.Em pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC ;
this uses 56 bit DES encryption but it was the strongest encryption
algorithm supported in PKCS#5 v1.5.
Using the
.Fl v2
option PKCS#5 v2.0 algorithms are used which can use any
encryption algorithm such as 168 bit triple DES or 128 bit RC2, however
not many implementations support PKCS#5 v2.0 yet.
If using private keys with
.Nm OpenSSL
then this doesn't matter.
.Pp
The
.Ar alg
argument is the encryption algorithm to use, valid values include
.Ar des , des3
and
.Ar rc2 .
It is recommended that
.Ar des3
is used.
.It Fl v1 Ar alg
This option specifies a PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 algorithm to use.
A complete list of possible algorithms is included below.
.Sh PKCS8 NOTES
The encrypted form of a
.Em PEM
encoded PKCS#8 file uses the following
headers and footers:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
\& -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
.Ed
.Pp
The unencrypted form uses:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
\& -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
.Ed
.Pp
Private keys encrypted using PKCS#5 v2.0 algorithms and high iteration
counts are more secure that those encrypted using the traditional
.Nm SSLeay
compatible formats.
So if additional security is considered, important the keys should be converted.
.Pp
The default encryption is only 56 bits because this is the encryption
that most current implementations of PKCS#8 will support.
.Pp
Some software may use PKCS#12 password based encryption algorithms
with PKCS#8 format private keys: these are handled automatically
but there is no option to produce them.
.Pp
It is possible to write out
.Em DER
encoded encrypted private keys in PKCS#8 format because the encryption
details are included at an ASN1
level whereas the traditional format includes them at a
.Em PEM
level.
.Sh PKCS#5 V1.5 AND PKCS#12 ALGORITHMS
Various algorithms can be used with the
.Fl v1
command line option, including PKCS#5 v1.5 and PKCS#12.
These are described in more detail below.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.It Ar \  \  PBE-MD2-DES PBE-MD5-DES
.br
These algorithms were included in the original PKCS#5 v1.5 specification.
They only offer 56 bits of protection since they both use DES.
.It Ar \  \  PBE-SHA1-RC2-64 PBE-MD2-RC2-64 PBE-MD5-RC2-64 PBE-SHA1-DES
.br
These algorithms are not mentioned in the original PKCS#5 v1.5 specification
but they use the same key derivation algorithm and are supported by some
software.
They are mentioned in PKCS#5 v2.0.
They use either 64 bit RC2 or 56 bit DES.
.It Ar \  \  PBE-SHA1-RC4-128 PBE-SHA1-RC4-40 PBE-SHA1-3DES PBE-SHA1-2DES PBE-SHA1-RC2-128 PBE-SHA1-RC2-40
.br
These algorithms use the PKCS#12 password based encryption algorithm and
allow strong encryption algorithms like triple DES or 128 bit RC2 to be used.
.Ed
.Sh PKCS8 EXAMPLES
Convert a private from traditional to PKCS#5 v2.0 format using triple DES:
.Pp
\& $ openssl pkcs8 -in key.pem -topk8 -v2 des3 -out enckey.pem
.Pp
Convert a private key to PKCS#8 using a PKCS#5 1.5 compatible algorithm (DES):
.Pp
\& $ openssl pkcs8 -in key.pem -topk8 -out enckey.pem
.Pp
Convert a private key to PKCS#8 using a PKCS#12 compatible algorithm (3DES):
.Pp
\& $ openssl pkcs8 -in key.pem -topk8 -out enckey.pem -v1 PBE-SHA1-3DES
.Pp
Read a DER unencrypted PKCS#8 format private key:
.Pp
\& $ openssl pkcs8 -inform DER -nocrypt -in key.der -out key.pem
.Pp
Convert a private key from any PKCS#8 format to traditional format:
.Pp
\& $ openssl pkcs8 -in pk8.pem -out key.pem
.Sh PKCS8 STANDARDS
Test vectors from this PKCS#5 v2.0 implementation were posted to the
pkcs-tng mailing list using triple DES, DES and RC2 with high iteration
counts, several people confirmed that they could decrypt the private
keys produced and therefore it can be assumed that the PKCS#5 v2.0
implementation is reasonably accurate at least as far as these
algorithms are concerned.
.Pp
The format of PKCS#8 DSA (and other) private keys is not well documented:
it is hidden away in PKCS#11 v2.01, section 11.9.;
.Nm OpenSSL Ns Li 's
default DSA PKCS#8 private key format complies with this standard.
.Sh PKCS8 BUGS
There should be an option that prints out the encryption algorithm
in use and other details such as the iteration count.
.Pp
PKCS#8 using triple DES and PKCS#5 v2.0 should be the default private
key format; for
.Nm OpenSSL
compatibility, several of the utilities use the old format at present.

The
.Nm pkcs12
command allows PKCS#12 files (sometimes referred to as PFX files)
to be created and parsed.
PKCS#12 files are used by several programs including Netscape, MSIE
and MS Outlook.
.Pp
There are a lot of options; the meaning of some depends on whether a
PKCS#12 file is being created or parsed.
By default a PKCS#12 file is parsed;
a PKCS#12 file can be created by using the
.Fl export
option (see below).
.Sh PKCS12 PARSING OPTIONS
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Fl in Ar filename
This specifies the
.Ar filename
of the PKCS#12 file to be parsed.
Standard input is used by default.
.It Fl out Ar filename
The
.Ar filename
to write certificates and private keys to, standard output by default.
They are all written in
.Em PEM
format.
.It Fl pass Ar arg , Fl passin Ar arg
The PKCS#12 file (i.e. input file) password source.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl passout Ar arg
Pass phrase source to encrypt any outputed private keys with.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl noout
This option inhibits output of the keys and certificates to the output file
version of the PKCS#12 file.
.It Fl clcerts
Only output client certificates (not CA certificates).
.It Fl cacerts
Only output CA certificates (not client certificates).
.It Fl nocerts
No certificates at all will be output.
.It Fl nokeys
No private keys will be output.
.It Fl info
Output additional information about the PKCS#12 file structure,
algorithms used and iteration counts.
.It Fl des
Use DES to encrypt private keys before outputting.
.It Fl des3
Use triple DES to encrypt private keys before outputting, this is the default.
.It Fl idea
Use IDEA to encrypt private keys before outputting.
.It Fl nodes
Don't encrypt the private keys at all.
.It Fl nomacver
Don't attempt to verify the integrity MAC before reading the file.
.It Fl twopass
Prompt for separate integrity and encryption passwords: most software
always assumes these are the same so this option will render such
PKCS#12 files unreadable.
.Ed
.Sh PKCS12 FILE CREATION OPTIONS
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Fl export
This option specifies that a PKCS#12 file will be created rather than
parsed.
.It Fl out Ar filename
This specifies
.Ar filename
to write the PKCS#12 file to.
Standard output is used by default.
.It Fl in Ar filename
The
.Ar filename
to read certificates and private keys from, standard input by default.
They must all be in
.Em PEM
format.
The order doesn't matter but one private key and its corresponding
certificate should be present.
If additional certificates are present, they will also be included
in the PKCS#12 file.
.It Fl inkey Ar filename
File to read private key from.
If not present then a private key must be present in the input file.
.It Fl name Ar friendlyname
This specifies the "friendly name" for the certificate and private key.
This name is typically displayed in list boxes by software importing the file.
.It Fl certfile Ar filename
A filename to read additional certificates from.
.It Fl caname Ar friendlyname
This specifies the "friendly name" for other certificates.
This option may be used multiple times to specify names for all certificates
in the order they appear.
Netscape ignores friendly names on other certificates,
whereas MSIE displays them.
.It Fl pass Ar arg , Fl passout Ar arg
The PKCS#12 file (i.e. output file) password source.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl passin Ar password
Pass phrase source to decrypt any input private keys with.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl chain
If this option is present then an attempt is made to include the entire
certificate chain of the user certificate.
The standard CA store is used for this search.
If the search fails it is considered a fatal error.
.It Fl descert
Encrypt the certificate using triple DES; this may render the PKCS#12
file unreadable by some "export grade" software.
By default the private key is encrypted using triple DES and the
certificate using 40 bit RC2.
.It Fl keypbe Ar alg , Fl certpbe Ar alg
These options allow the algorithm used to encrypt the private key and
certificates to be selected.
Although any PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 algorithms can be selected,
it is advisable only to use PKCS#12 algorithms.
See the list in the
.Sx PKCS12 NOTES
section for more information.
.It Fl keyex | keysig
Specifies that the private key is to be used for key exchange or just signing.
This option is only interpreted by MSIE and similar MS software.
Normally "export grade" software will only allow 512 bit RSA keys to be
used for encryption purposes, but arbitrary length keys for signing.
The
.Fl keysig
option marks the key for signing only.
Signing only keys can be used for S/MIME signing,
authenticode (ActiveX control signing) and SSL client authentication;
however, due to a bug only MSIE 5.0 and later support
the use of signing only keys for SSL client authentication.
.It Fl nomaciter , noiter
These options affect the iteration counts on the MAC and key algorithms.
Unless you wish to produce files compatible with MSIE 4.0 you should leave
these options alone.
.Pp
To discourage attacks by using large dictionaries of common passwords the
algorithm that derives keys from passwords can have an iteration count applied
to it: this causes a certain part of the algorithm to be repeated and slows it
down.
The MAC is used to check the file integrity but since it will normally
have the same password as the keys and certificates it could also be attacked.
By default both MAC and encryption iteration counts are set to 2048;
using these options the MAC and encryption iteration counts can be set to 1.
Since this reduces the file security you should not use these options
unless you really have to.
Most software supports both MAC and key iteration counts.
MSIE 4.0 doesn't support MAC iteration counts, so it needs the
.Fl nomaciter
option.
.It Fl maciter
This option is included for compatibility with previous versions, it used
to be needed to use MAC iterations counts but they are now used by default.
.It Fl rand Ar file ...
A
.Ar file
or
.Ar file Ns Li s
containing random data used to seed the random number generator,
or an EGD socket (see
.Xr RAND_egd 3 ) .
Multiple files can be specified separated by an OS-dependent character.
The separator is
.Cm \&;
for MS-Windows,
.Cm \&,
for OpenVMS, and
.Cm \&:
for all others.
.Ed
.Sh PKCS12 NOTES
Although there are a large number of options,
most of them are very rarely used.
For PKCS#12 file parsing only
.Fl in
and
.Fl out
need to be used for PKCS#12 file creation.
.Fl export
and
.Fl name
are also used.
.Pp
If none of the
.Fl clcerts , cacerts
or
.Fl nocerts
options are present then all certificates will be output in the order
they appear in the input PKCS#12 files.
There is no guarantee that the first certificate present is
the one corresponding to the private key.
Certain software which requires a private key and certificate and assumes
the first certificate in the file is the one corresponding to the private key:
this may not always be the case.
Using the
.Fl clcerts
option will solve this problem by only outputting the certificate
corresponding to the private key.
If the CA certificates are required then they can be output to a separate
file using the
.Fl nokeys
and
.Fl cacerts
options to just output CA certificates.
.Pp
The
.Fl keypbe
and
.Fl certpbe
algorithms allow the precise encryption algorithms for private keys
and certificates to be specified.
Normally the defaults are fine but occasionally software can't handle
triple DES encrypted private keys;
then the option
.Fl keypbe Ar PBE-SHA1-RC2-40
can be used to reduce the private key encryption to 40 bit RC2.
A complete description of all algorithms is contained in the
.Sx PKCS8
section above.

.Ed
.Sh PKCS12 BUGS
Some would argue that the PKCS#12 standard is one big bug :\-)
.Pp
Versions of
.Nm OpenSSL
before 0.9.6a had a bug in the PKCS#12 key generation routines.
Under rare circumstances this could produce a PKCS#12 file encrypted
with an invalid key.
As a result some PKCS#12 files which triggered this bug
from other implementations (MSIE or Netscape) could not be decrypted
by
.Nm OpenSSL
and similarly
.Nm OpenSSL
could produce PKCS#12 files which could not be decrypted by other
implementations.
The chances of producing such a file are relatively small: less than 1 in 256.
.Pp
A side effect of fixing this bug is that any old invalidly encrypted PKCS#12
files can no longer be parsed by the fixed version.
Under such circumstances the
.Nm pkcs12
utility will report that the MAC is OK but fail with a decryption
error when extracting private keys.
.Pp
This problem can be resolved by extracting the private keys and certificates
from the PKCS#12 file using an older version of
.Nm OpenSSL
and recreating
the PKCS#12 file from the keys and certificates using a newer version of
.Nm OpenSSL .
For example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& $ old-openssl -in bad.p12 -out keycerts.pem
\& $ openssl -in keycerts.pem -export -name "My PKCS#12 file" -out fixed.p12

It can additionally create self-signed certificates,
for use as root CAs, for example.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Fl inform Ar DER|PEM
This specifies the input format.
The
.Ar DER
argument uses an ASN1 DER encoded
form compatible with the PKCS#10.
The
.Ar PEM
form is the default format:
it consists of the DER format base64 encoded with additional header and
footer lines.
.It Fl outform Ar DER|PEM
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
.Fl inform
option.
.It Fl in Ar filename
This specifies the input
.Ar filename
to read a request from, or standard input
if this option is not specified.
A request is only read if the creation options
.Fl new
and
.Fl newkey
are not specified.
.It Fl passin Ar arg
The input file password source.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl out Ar filename
This specifies the output
.Ar filename
to write to, or standard output by default.
.It Fl passout Ar arg
The output file password source.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl text
Prints out the certificate request in text form.
.It Fl pubkey
Outputs the public key.
.It Fl noout
This option prevents output of the encoded version of the request.
.It Fl modulus
This option prints out the value of the modulus of the public key
contained in the request.
.It Fl verify
Verifies the signature on the request.
.It Fl new
This option generates a new certificate request.
It will prompt the user for the relevant field values.
The actual fields prompted for and their maximum and minimum sizes
are specified in the configuration file and any requested extensions.
.Pp
If the
.Fl key
option is not used it will generate a new RSA private
key using information specified in the configuration file.
.It Fl rand Ar file ...
A
.Ar file
or
.Ar file Ns Li s
containing random data used to seed the random number generator,
or an EGD socket (see
.Xr RAND_egd 3 ) .
Multiple files can be specified separated by an OS-dependent character.
The separator is
.Cm \&;
for MS-Windows,
.Cm \&,
for OpenVMS, and
.Cm \&:
for all others.
.It Fl newkey Ar arg
This option creates a new certificate request and a new private key.
The argument takes one of two forms:
.Ar rsa:nbits ,
where
.Ar nbits
is the number of bits, generates an RSA key
.Ar nbits
in size.
.Ar dsa:filename
generates a DSA key using the parameters in the file
.Ar filename.
.It Fl key Ar filename
This specifies the file to read the private key from.
It also accepts PKCS#8 format private keys for
.Em PEM
format files.
.It Fl keyform Ar PEM|DER
The format of the private key file specified in the
.Fl key
argument.
.AR PEM
is the default.
.It Fl keyout Ar filename
This gives the
.Ar filename
to write the newly created private key to.
If this option is not specified, then the filename present in the
configuration file is used.
.It Fl nodes
If this option is specified then if a private key is created it
will not be encrypted.
.It Fl md5|sha1|md2|mdc2
This specifies the message digest to sign the request with.
This overrides the digest algorithm specified in the configuration file.
This option is ignored for DSA requests: they always use SHA1.
.It Fl config Ar filename
This allows an alternative configuration file to be specified;
this overrides the compile time filename or any specified in
the
.Em OPENSSL_CONF
environment variable.
.It Fl subj Ar arg
Sets subject name for new request or supersedes the subject name
when processing a request.
The arg must be formatted as
.Em /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=... ,
characters may be escaped by \e (backslash), no spaces are skipped.
.It Fl x509
This option outputs a self-signed certificate instead of a certificate
request.
This is typically used to generate a test certificate or
a self-signed root CA.
The extensions added to the certificate
(if any) are specified in the configuration file.
Unless specified using the
.Fl set_serial
option, 0 will be used for the serial number.
.It Fl days Ar n
When the
.Fl x509
option is being used this specifies the number of
days to certify the certificate for.
The default is 30 days.
.It Fl set_serial Ar n
Serial number to use when outputting a self-signed certificate.
This may be specified as a decimal value or a hex value if preceded by
.Em 0x .
It is possible to use negative serial numbers but this is not recommended.
.It Fl extensions Ar section , Fl reqexts Ar section
These options specify alternative sections to include certificate
extensions (if the
.Fl x509
option is present) or certificate request extensions.
This allows several different sections to
be used in the same configuration file to specify requests for
a variety of purposes.
.It Fl utf8
This option causes field values to be interpreted as UTF8 strings, by 
default they are interpreted as ASCII.
This means that the field values, whether prompted from a terminal or
obtained from a configuration file, must be valid UTF8 strings.
.It Fl nameopt Ar option
Option which determines how the subject or issuer names are displayed.
The
.Ar option
argument can be a single option or multiple options separated by commas.
Alternatively, the
.Fl nameopt
switch may be used more than once to set multiple options.
See the
.Sx X509
section below for details.
.It Fl asn1-kludge
By default the
.Nm req
command outputs certificate requests containing
no attributes in the correct PKCS#10 format.
However certain CAs will only
accept requests containing no attributes in an invalid form: this
option produces this invalid format.
.Pp
More precisely the
.Em Attributes
in a PKCS#10 certificate request are defined as a SET OF Attribute.
They are
.Em not
optional, so if no attributes are present then they should be encoded as an
empty SET OF.
The invalid form does not include the empty
SET OF, whereas the correct form does.
.Pp
It should be noted that very few CAs still require the use of this option.
.It Fl newhdr
Adds the word NEW to the
.Em PEM
file header and footer lines on the outputed request.
Some software (Netscape certificate server) and some CAs need this.
.It Fl batch
Non-interactive mode.
.It Fl verbose
Print extra details about the operations being performed.
.Ed
.Sh REQ CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
The configuration options are specified in the
.Em req
section of the configuration file.
As with all configuration files, if no value is specified in the specific
section (i.e.
.Em req )
then the initial unnamed or
.Em default
section is searched too.
.Pp
The options available are described in detail below.
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Ar input_password output_password
The passwords for the input private key file (if present) and
the output private key file (if one will be created).
The command line options
.Fl passin
and
.Fl passout
override the configuration file values.
.It Ar default_bits
This specifies the default key size in bits.
If not specified, then 512 is used.
It is used if the
.Fl new
option is used.
It can be overridden by using the
.Fl newkey
option.
.It Ar default_keyfile
This is the default filename to write a private key to.
If not specified, the key is written to standard output.
This can be overridden by the
.Fl keyout
option.
.It Ar oid_file
This specifies a file containing additional OBJECT IDENTIFIERS.
Each line of the file should consist of the numerical form of the
object identifier, followed by whitespace, then the short name followed
by whitespace and finally the long name. 
.It Ar oid_section
This specifies a section in the configuration file containing extra
object identifiers.
Each line should consist of the short name of the
object identifier followed by
.Cm =
and the numerical form.
The short and long names are the same when this option is used.
.It Ar RANDFILE
This specifies a filename in which random number seed information is
placed and read from, or an EGD socket (see
.Xr RAND_egd 3 ) .
It is used for private key generation.
.It Ar encrypt_key
If this is set to
.Em no
then if a private key is generated it is
.Em not
encrypted.
This is equivalent to the
.Fl nodes
command line option.
For compatibility,
.Ar encrypt_rsa_key
is an equivalent option.
.It Ar default_md
This option specifies the digest algorithm to use.
Possible values include
.Ar md5, sha1
and
.Ar mdc2 .
If not present then MD5 is used.
This option can be overridden on the command line.
.It Ar string_mask
This option masks out the use of certain string types in certain
fields.
Most users will not need to change this option.
.Pp
It can be set to several values:
.Ar default ,
which is also the default option, uses
.Em PrintableStrings , T61Strings
and
.Em BMPStrings ;
if the 
.Ar pkix
value is used then only
.Em PrintableStrings
and
.Em BMPStrings
will be used.
This follows the PKIX recommendation in RFC2459.
If the
.Fl utf8only
option is used then only
.Em UTF8Strings
will be used: this is the PKIX recommendation in RFC2459 after 2003.
Finally, the
.Ar nombstr
option just uses
.Em PrintableStrings
and
.Em T61Strings :
certain software has problems with
.Em BMPStrings
and
.Em UTF8Strings :
in particular Netscape.
.It Ar req_extensions
This specifies the configuration file section containing a list of
extensions to add to the certificate request.
It can be overridden by the
.Fl reqexts
command line switch.
.It Ar x509_extensions
This specifies the configuration file section containing a list of
extensions to add to a certificate generated when the
.Fl x509
switch is used.
It can be overridden by the
.Fl extensions
command line switch.
.It Ar prompt
If set to the value
.Em no ,
this disables prompting of certificate fields
and just takes values from the config file directly.
It also changes the expected format of the
.Em distinguished_name
and
.Em attributes
sections.
.It Ar utf8
If set to the value
.Em yes ,
then field values are interpreted as UTF8 strings;
by default they are interpreted as ASCII.
This means that the field values, whether prompted from a terminal or
obtained from a configuration file, must be valid UTF8 strings.
.It Ar attributes
This specifies the section containing any request attributes: its format
is the same as
.Ar distinguished_name .
Typically these may contain the
.Em challengePassword
or
.Em unstructuredName
types.
They are currently ignored by
.Nm OpenSSL Ns Li 's
request signing utilities, but some CAs might want them.
.It Ar distinguished_name
This specifies the section containing the distinguished name fields to
prompt for when generating a certificate or certificate request.
The format is described in the next section.
.Ed
.Sh REQ DISTINGUISHED NAME AND ATTRIBUTE SECTION FORMAT
There are two separate formats for the distinguished name and attribute
sections.
If the
.Fl prompt
option is set to
.Em no
then these sections just consist of field names and values: for example,
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& CN=My Name
\& OU=My Organization
\& emailAddress=someone@somewhere.org
.Ed
.Pp
This allows external programs (e.g. GUI based) to generate a template file
with all the field names and values and just pass it to
.Nm req .
An example of this kind of configuration file is contained in the
.Sx REQ EXAMPLES
section.
.Pp
Alternatively if the
.Fl prompt
option is absent or not set to
.Em no ,
then the file contains field prompting information.
It consists of lines of the form:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& fieldName="prompt"
\& fieldName_default="default field value"
\& fieldName_min= 2
\& fieldName_max= 4
.Ed
.Pp
"fieldName" is the field name being used, for example
.Em commonName
(or CN).
The "prompt" string is used to ask the user to enter the relevant details.
If the user enters nothing, then the default value is used;
if no default value is present then the field is omitted.
A field can still be omitted if a default value is present,
if the user just enters the '.' character.
.Pp
The number of characters entered must be between the
.Em fieldName_min
and
.Em fieldName_max
limits:
there may be additional restrictions based on the field being used
(for example
.Em countryName
can only ever be two characters long and must fit in a
.Em PrintableString ) .
.Pp
Some fields (such as
.Em organizationName )
can be used more than once in a DN.
This presents a problem because configuration files will
not recognize the same name occurring twice.
To avoid this problem if the
.Em fieldName
contains some characters followed by a full stop they will be ignored.
So, for example, a second
.Em organizationName
can be input by calling it "1.organizationName".
.Pp
The actual permitted field names are any object identifier short or
long names.
These are compiled into
.Nm OpenSSL
and include the usual values such as
.Em commonName , countryName , localityName , organizationName ,
.Em organizationUnitName , stateOrPrivinceName .
Additionally
.Em emailAddress
is included as well as
.Em name , surname , givenName initials
and
.Em dnQualifier .
.Pp
Additional object identifiers can be defined with the
.Ar oid_file
or
.Ar oid_section
options in the configuration file.
Any additional fields will be treated as though they were a
.Em DirectoryString .
.Sh REQ EXAMPLES

.Sh REQ NOTES
The header and footer lines in the
.Ar PEM
format are normally:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST----
\& -----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST----
.Ed
.Pp
Some software (some versions of Netscape certificate server) instead needs:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& -----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST----
\& -----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST----
.Ed
.Pp
which is produced with the
.Fl newhdr
option but is otherwise compatible.
Either form is accepted transparently on input.
.Pp
The certificate requests generated by Xenroll with MSIE have extensions added.
It includes the
.Em keyUsage
extension which determines the type of
key (signature only or general purpose) and any additional OIDs entered
by the script in an
.Em extendedKeyUsage
extension.
.Sh REQ DIAGNOSTICS
The following messages are frequently asked about:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\&        Using configuration from /some/path/openssl.cnf
\&        Unable to load config info
.Ed
.Pp
This is followed some time later by...
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\&        unable to find 'distinguished_name' in config
\&        problems making Certificate Request
.Ed
.Pp
The first error message is the clue: it can't find the configuration
file!
Certain operations (like examining a certificate request) don't
need a configuration file so its use isn't enforced.
Generation of certificates or requests, however, do need a configuration file.
This could be regarded as a bug.
.Pp
Another puzzling message is this:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\&        Attributes:
\&            a0:00
.Ed
.Pp
This is displayed when no attributes are present and the request includes
the correct empty SET OF structure (the DER encoding of which is 0xa0 0x00).
If you just see:
.Pp
\&        Attributes:
.Pp
then the SET OF is missing and the encoding is technically invalid (but
it is tolerated).
See the description of the command line option
.Fl asn1-kludge
for more information.
.Sh REQ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The variable
.Em OPENSSL_CONF ,
if defined, allows an alternative configuration
file location to be specified; it will be overridden by the
.Fl config
command line switch if it is present.
For compatibility reasons the
.Em SSLEAY_CONF
environment variable serves the same purpose but its use is discouraged.
.Sh REQ BUGS
.Nm OpenSSL Ns Li 's
handling of T61Strings (aka TeletexStrings) is broken: it effectively
treats them as ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1);
Netscape and MSIE have similar behaviour.
This can cause problems if you need characters that aren't available in
.Em PrintableStrings
and you don't want to or can't use
.Em BMPStrings .
.Pp
As a consequence of the T61String handling the only correct way to represent
accented characters in
.Nm OpenSSL
is to use a
.Em BMPString :
unfortunately Netscape currently chokes on these.
If you have to use accented characters with Netscape
and MSIE then you currently need to use the invalid T61String form.
.Pp
The current prompting is not very friendly.
It doesn't allow you to confirm what you've just entered.
Other things like extensions in certificate requests are
statically defined in the configuration file.
Some of these, like an email address in
.Em subjectAltName
should be input by the user.

.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Fl inform Ar DER|NET|PEM
This specifies the input format.
The

uses an ASN1 DER encoded form compatible with the PKCS#1
RSAPrivateKey or SubjectPublicKeyInfo format.
The
.Ar PEM
form is the default format: it consists of the DER format base64
encoded with additional header and footer lines.
On input PKCS#8 format private keys are also accepted.
The
.Ar NET
form is a format described in the
.Sx RSA NOTES
section.
.It Fl outform Ar DER|NET|PEM
This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
.Fl inform
option.
.It Fl in Ar filename
This specifies the input
.Ar filename
to read a key from or standard input if this
option is not specified.
If the key is encrypted, a pass phrase will be prompted for.
.It Fl passin Ar arg
The input file password source.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl out Ar filename
This specifies the output
.Ar filename
to write a key to, or standard output if this option is not specified.
If any encryption options are set then a pass phrase will be prompted for.
The output filename should
.Em not
be the same as the input filename.
.It Fl passout Ar password
The output file password source.
For more information about the format of
.Ar arg
see the
.Sx PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
section above.
.It Fl sgckey
Use the modified
.Em NET
algorithm used with some versions of Microsoft IIS and SGC keys.
.It Cm -des|-des3|-idea
These options encrypt the private key with the DES, triple DES, or the 
IDEA ciphers, respectively, before outputting it.
A pass phrase is prompted for.
If none of these options is specified the key is written in plain text.
This means that using the
.Nm rsa
utility to read in an encrypted key with no encryption option can be used
to remove the pass phrase from a key, or by setting the encryption options
it can be used to add or change the pass phrase.
These options can only be used with
.Ar PEM
format output files.
.It Fl text
Prints out the various public or private key components in
plain text, in addition to the encoded version. 
.It Fl noout
This option prevents output of the encoded version of the key.
.It Fl modulus
This option prints out the value of the modulus of the key.
.It Fl check
This option checks the consistency of an RSA private key.
.It Fl pubin
By default a private key is read from the input file: with this
option a public key is read instead.
.It Fl pubout
By default a private key is output:
with this option a public key will be output instead.
This option is automatically set if the input is a public key.
.Ed
.Sh RSA NOTES
The
.Em PEM
private key format uses the header and footer lines:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
\& -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Em PEM
public key format uses the header and footer lines:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
\& -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Em NET
form is a format compatible with older Netscape servers
and Microsoft IIS .key files; this uses unsalted RC4 for its encryption.
It is not very secure and so should only be used when necessary.
.Pp
Some newer version of IIS have additional data in the exported .key files.
To use these with the
.Nm rsa
utility, view the file with a binary editor
and look for the string "private-key", then trace back to the byte
sequence 0x30, 0x82 (this is an ASN1 SEQUENCE).
Copy all the data from this point onwards to another file and use that as
the input to the
.Nm rsa
utility with the
.Fl inform Ar NET
option.
If there is an error after entering the password, try the
.Fl sgckey
option.

.Pp
The
.Nm s_client
command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects
to a remote host using SSL/TLS.
It is a
.Em very
useful diagnostic tool for SSL servers.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Fl connect Ar host:port
This specifies the
.Ar host
and optional
.Ar port
to connect to.
If not specified then an attempt is made to connect to the local host
on port 4433.
.It Fl cert Ar certname
The certificate to use, if one is requested by the server.
The default is not to use a certificate.
.It Fl key Ar keyfile
The private key to use.
If not specified then the certificate file will be used.
.It Fl verify Ar depth
The verify
.Ar depth
to use.
This specifies the maximum length of the
server certificate chain and turns on server certificate verification.
Currently the verify operation continues after errors so all the problems
with a certificate chain can be seen.
As a side effect the connection will never fail due to a server
certificate verify failure.
.It Fl CApath Ar directory
The
.Ar directory
to use for server certificate verification.
This directory must be in "hash format", see
.Fl verify
for more information.
These are also used when building the client certificate chain.
.It Fl CAfile Ar file
A
.Ar file
containing trusted certificates to use during server authentication
and to use when attempting to build the client certificate chain.
.It Fl reconnect
Reconnects to the same server 5 times using the same session ID; this can
be used as a test that session caching is working.
.It Fl pause
Pauses 1 second between each read and write call.
.It Fl showcerts
Display the whole server certificate chain: normally only the server
certificate itself is displayed.
.It Fl prexit
Print session information when the program exits.
This will always attempt
to print out information even if the connection fails.
Normally information will only be printed out once if the connection succeeds.
This option is useful because the cipher in use may be renegotiated
or the connection may fail because a client certificate is required or is
requested only after an attempt is made to access a certain URL.
.Sy Note :
the output produced by this option is not always accurate because a
connection might never have been established.
.It Fl state
Prints out the SSL session states.
.It Fl debug
Print extensive debugging information including a hex dump of all traffic.
.It Fl msg
Show all protocol messages with hex dump.
.It Fl nbio_test
Tests non-blocking I/O.
.It Fl nbio
Turns on non-blocking I/O.
.It Fl crlf
This option translates a line feed from the terminal into CR+LF as required
by some servers.
.It Fl ign_eof
Inhibit shutting down the connection when end of file is reached in the
input.
.It Fl quiet
Inhibit printing of session and certificate information.
This implicitly turns on
.Fl ign_eof
as well.
.It Fl ssl2 , ssl3 , tls1 , no_ssl2 ,
.It Fl no_ssl3 , no_tls1
These options disable the use of certain SSL or TLS protocols.
By default the initial handshake uses a method which should be compatible
with all servers and permit them to use SSL v3, SSL v2 or TLS as appropriate.
.Pp
Unfortunately there are a lot of ancient and broken servers in use which
cannot handle this technique and will fail to connect.
Some servers only work if TLS is turned off with the
.Fl no_tls
option, others will only support SSL v2 and may need the
.Fl ssl2
option.
.It Fl bugs
There are several known bugs in SSL and TLS implementations.
Adding this option enables various workarounds.
.It Fl cipher Ar cipherlist
This allows the cipher list sent by the client to be modified.
Although the server determines which cipher suite is used it should take
the first supported cipher in the list sent by the client.
See the
.Sx CIPHERS
section above for more information.
.It Fl engine Ar id
Specifying an engine (by it's unique
.Ar id
string) will cause
.Nm s_client
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed.
The engine will then be set as the default for all available algorithms.
.It Fl rand Ar file ...
A
.Ar file
or
.Ar file Ns Li s
containing random data used to seed the random number generator,
or an EGD socket (see
.Xr RAND_egd 3 ) .
Multiple files can be specified separated by an OS-dependent character.
The separator is
.Cm \&;
for MS-Windows,
.Cm \&,
for OpenVMS, and
.Cm \&:
for
all others.
.Ed
.Sh S_CLIENT CONNECTED COMMANDS
If a connection is established with an SSL server then any data received
from the server is displayed and any key presses will be sent to the
server.
When used interactively (which means neither
.Fl quiet
nor
.Fl ign_eof
have been given), the session will be renegotiated if the line begins with an
.Em R ,
and if the line begins with a
.Em Q
or if end of file is reached, the connection will be closed down.
.Sh S_CLIENT NOTES
.Nm s_client
can be used to debug SSL servers.
To connect to an SSL HTTP server the command:
.Pp
\& $ openssl s_client -connect servername:443
.Pp
would typically be used (https uses port 443).
If the connection succeeds then an HTTP command can be given such as
"GET" to retrieve a web page.
.Pp
If the handshake fails then there are several possible causes; if it is
nothing obvious like no client certificate then the
.Fl bugs , ssl2 , ssl3 , tls1 ,
.Fl no_ssl2 , no_ssl3
and
.Fl no_tls1
options can be tried in case it is a buggy server.
In particular these options should be tried
.Em before
submitting a bug report to an
.Nm OpenSSL
mailing list.
.Pp
A frequent problem when attempting to get client certificates working
is that a web client complains it has no certificates or gives an empty
list to choose from.
This is normally because the server is not sending the clients certificate
authority in its "acceptable CA list" when it
requests a certificate.
By using
.Nm s_client
the CA list can be viewed and checked.
However some servers only request client authentication
after a specific URL is requested.
To obtain the list in this case it is necessary to use the
.Fl prexit
command and send an HTTP request for an appropriate page.
.Pp
If a certificate is specified on the command line using the
.Fl cert
option it will not be used unless the server specifically requests
a client certificate.
Therefore merely including a client certificate
on the command line is no guarantee that the certificate works.
.Pp
If there are problems verifying a server certificate then the
.Fl showcerts
option can be used to show the whole chain.
.Sh S_CLIENT BUGS
Because this program has a lot of options and also because some of
the techniques used are rather old, the C source of
.Nm s_client
is rather hard to read and not a model of how things should be done.
A typical SSL client program would be much simpler.
.Pp
The
.Fl verify
option should really exit if the server verification fails.
.Pp
The
.Fl prexit
option is a bit of a hack.
We should really report information whenever a session is renegotiated.

The
.Nm s_server
command implements a generic SSL/TLS server which listens
for connections on a given port using SSL/TLS.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Fl accept Ar port
The TCP
.Ar port
to listen on for connections.
If not specified, 4433 is used.
.It Fl context Ar id
Sets the SSL context id.
It can be given any string value.
If this option is not present, a default value will be used.
.It Fl cert Ar certname
The certificate to use; most servers cipher suites require the use of a
certificate and some require a certificate with a certain public key type:
for example the DSS cipher suites require a certificate containing a DSS
(DSA) key.
If not specified then the filename
.Pa server.pem
will be used.
.It Fl key Ar keyfile
The private key to use.
If not specified then the certificate file will be used.
.It Fl dcert Ar filename , Fl dkey Ar keyname
Specify an additional certificate and private key; these behave in the
same manner as the
.Fl cert
and
.Fl key
options except there is no default if they are not specified
(no additional certificate and key is used).
As noted above some cipher suites require a certificate containing a key of
a certain type.
Some cipher suites need a certificate carrying an RSA key
and some a DSS (DSA) key.
By using RSA and DSS certificates and keys
a server can support clients which only support RSA or DSS cipher suites
by using an appropriate certificate.
.It Fl nocert
If this option is set then no certificate is used.
This restricts the cipher suites available to the anonymous ones
(currently just anonymous DH).
.It Fl dhparam Ar filename
The DH parameter file to use.
The ephemeral DH cipher suites generate keys
using a set of DH parameters.
If not specified, then an attempt is made to
load the parameters from the server certificate file.
If this fails then a static set of parameters hard coded into the
.Nm s_server
program will be used.
.It Fl no_dhe
If this option is set, then no DH parameters will be loaded, effectively
disabling the ephemeral DH cipher suites.
.It Fl no_tmp_rsa
Certain export cipher suites sometimes use a temporary RSA key; this option
disables temporary RSA key generation.
.It Fl verify Ar depth , Fl Verify Ar depth
The verify
.Ar depth
to use.
This specifies the maximum length of the client certificate chain
and makes the server request a certificate from the client.
With the
.Fl verify
option a certificate is requested but the client does not have to send one.
With the
.Fl Verify
option the client must supply a certificate or an error occurs.
.It Fl CApath Ar directory
The
.Ar directory
to use for client certificate verification.
This directory must be in "hash format", see
.Fl verify
for more information.
These are also used when building the server certificate chain.
.It Fl CAfile Ar file
A file containing trusted certificates to use during client authentication
and to use when attempting to build the server certificate chain.
The list is also used in the list of acceptable client CAs passed to the
client when a certificate is requested.
.It Fl state
Prints out the SSL session states.
.It Fl debug
Print extensive debugging information including a hex dump of all traffic.
.It Fl msg
Show all protocol messages with hex dump.
.It Fl nbio_test
Tests non blocking I/O.
.It Fl nbio
Turns on non blocking I/O.
.It Fl crlf
This option translates a line feed from the terminal into CR+LF.
.It Fl quiet
Inhibit printing of session and certificate information.
.It Fl ssl2 , ssl3 , tls1 , no_ssl2 ,
.It Fl no_ssl3 , no_tls1
These options disable the use of certain SSL or TLS protocols.
By default, the initial handshake uses a method which should be compatible
with all servers and permit them to use SSL v3, SSL v2 or TLS as appropriate.
.It Fl bugs
There are several known bugs in SSL and TLS implementations.
Adding this option enables various workarounds.
.It Fl hack
This option enables a further workaround for some some early Netscape
SSL code (?).
.It Fl cipher Ar cipherlist
This allows the cipher list used by the server to be modified.
When the client sends a list of supported ciphers, the first client cipher
also included in the server list is used.
Because the client specifies the preference order, the order of the server
cipherlist irrelevant.
See the
.Sx CIPHERS
section for more information.
.It Fl www
Sends a status message back to the client when it connects.
This includes lots of information about the ciphers used and various
session parameters.
The output is in HTML format so this option will normally be used with a
web browser.
.It Fl WWW
Emulates a simple web server.
Pages will be resolved relative to the current directory;
for example if the URL
.Pa https://myhost/page.html
is requested, the file
.Pa ./page.html
will be loaded.
.It Fl HTTP
Emulates a simple web server.
Pages will be resolved relative to the current directory;
for example if the URL
.Pa https://myhost/page.html
is requested the file
.Pa ./page.html
will be loaded.
The files loaded are assumed to contain a complete and correct HTTP
response (lines that are part of the HTTP response line and headers
must end with CRLF).
.It Fl engine Ar id
Specifying an engine (by it's unique
.Ar id
string) will cause
.Nm s_server
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed.
The engine will then be set as the default for all available algorithms.
.It Fl rand Ar file ...
A
.Ar file
or
.Ar file Ns Li s
containing random data used to seed the random number generator,
or an EGD socket (see
.Xr RAND_egd 3 ) .
Multiple files can be specified separated by an OS-dependent character.

.Pp
Certain single letter commands are also recognized which perform special
operations: these are listed below.
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Ar q
End the current SSL connection, but still accept new connections.
.It Ar Q
End the current SSL connection and exit.
.It Ar r
Renegotiate the SSL session.
.It Ar R
Renegotiate the SSL session and request a client certificate.
.It Ar P
Send some plain text down the underlying TCP connection: this should
cause the client to disconnect due to a protocol violation.
.It Ar S
Print out some session cache status information.
.Ed
.Sh S_SERVER NOTES
.Nm s_server
can be used to debug SSL clients.
To accept connections from a web browser the command:
.Pp
\& $ openssl s_server -accept 443 -www
.Pp
can be used for example.
.Pp
Most web browsers (in particular Netscape and MSIE) only support RSA cipher
suites, so they cannot connect to servers which don't use a certificate
carrying an RSA key or a version of
.Nm OpenSSL
with RSA disabled.
.Pp
Although specifying an empty list of CAs when requesting a client certificate
is strictly speaking a protocol violation, some SSL
clients interpret this to mean any CA is acceptable.
This is useful for debugging purposes.
.Pp
The session parameters can printed out using the
.Nm sess_id
program.

.Pp
There are five operation options that set the type of operation to be performed.
The meaning of the other options varies according to the operation type.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Fl encrypt
Encrypt mail for the given recipient certificates.
Input file is the message to be encrypted.
The output file is the encrypted mail in
.Em MIME
format.
.It Fl decrypt
Decrypt mail using the supplied certificate and private key.
Expects an encrypted mail message in
.Em MIME
format for the input file.
The decrypted mail is written to the output file.
.It Fl sign
Sign mail using the supplied certificate and private key.
Input file is the message to be signed.
The signed message in
.Em MIME
format is written to the output file.
.It Fl verify
Verify signed mail.
Expects a signed mail message on input and outputs the signed data.
Both clear text and opaque signing is supported.
.It Fl pk7out
Takes an input message and writes out a
.Em PEM
encoded PKCS#7 structure.
.It Fl in Ar filename
The input message to be encrypted or signed or the
.Em MIME
message to
be decrypted or verified.
.It Fl inform Ar SMIME|PEM|DER
This specifies the input format for the PKCS#7 structure.
The default is
.Em SMIME
which reads an
.Em S/MIME
format message.
.Em PEM
and
.Em DER
format change this to expect PEM and DER format PKCS#7 structures
instead.
This currently only affects the input format of the PKCS#7
structure, if no PKCS#7 structure is being input (for example with
.Fl encrypt
or
.Fl sign )
this option has no effect.
.It Fl out Ar filename
The message text that has been decrypted or verified, or the output
.Em MIME
format message that has been signed or verified.
.It Fl outform Ar SMIME|PEM|DER
This specifies the output format for the PKCS#7 structure.
The default is
.Em SMIME
which writes an
.Em S/MIME
format message.
.Em PEM
and
.Em DER
format change this to write PEM and DER format PKCS#7 structures
instead.
This currently only affects the output format of the PKCS#7
structure; if no PKCS#7 structure is being output (for example with
.Fl verify
or
.Fl decrypt )
this option has no effect.
.It Fl content Ar filename
This specifies a file containing the detached content.
This is only useful with the
.Fl verify
command.
This is only usable if the PKCS#7 structure is using the detached
signature form where the content is not included.
This option will override any content if the input format is
.Em S/MIME
and it uses the multipart/signed
.Em MIME
content type.
.It Fl text
This option adds plain text (text/plain)
.Em MIME
headers to the supplied message if encrypting or signing.
If decrypting or verifying it strips off text headers:
if the decrypted or verified message is not of
.Em MIME 
type text/plain then an error occurs.
.It Fl CAfile Ar file
A
.Ar file
containing trusted CA certificates, only used with
.Fl verify .
.It Fl CApath Ar dir
A
.Ar directory
containing trusted CA certificates, only used with
.Fl verify .
This directory must be a standard certificate directory;
that is, a hash of each subject name (using
.Nm x509 -hash )
should be linked to each certificate.
.It Fl des des3 rc2-40 rc2-64 rc2-128
The encryption algorithm to use.
DES (56 bits), triple DES\s0 (168 bits)
or 40, 64 or 128 bit RC2, respectively; if not specified 40 bit RC2 is
used.
Only used with
.Fl encrypt .
.It Fl nointern
When verifying a message, normally certificates (if any) included in
the message are searched for the signing certificate.
With this option only the certificates specified in the
.Fl certfile
option are used.
The supplied certificates can still be used as untrusted CAs however.
.It Fl noverify
Do not verify the signer's certificate of a signed message.
.It Fl nochain
Do not do chain verification of signers' certificates: that is don't
use the certificates in the signed message as untrusted CAs.
.It Fl nosigs
Don't try to verify the signatures on the message.
.It Fl nocerts
When signing a message, the signer's certificate is normally included;
with this option it is excluded.
This will reduce the size of the signed message but the verifier must
have a copy of the signer's certificate available locally (passed using the
.Fl certfile
option, for example).
.It Fl noattr
Normally, when a message is signed a set of attributes are included which
include the signing time and supported symmetric algorithms.
With this option they are not included.
.It Fl binary
Normally the input message is converted to "canonical" format which is
effectively using CR and LF as end of line: as required by the
.Em S/MIME
specification.
When this option is present no translation occurs.
This is useful when handling binary data which may not be in

Allows additional certificates to be specified.
When signing these will be included with the message.
When verifying these will be searched for the signers' certificates.

The signer's certificate when signing a message.
If a message is being verified, then the signer's certificates will be
written to this file if the verification was successful.
.It Fl recip Ar file
The recipients certificate when decrypting a message.
This certificate
must match one of the recipients of the message or an error occurs.
.It Fl inkey Ar file
The private key to use when signing or decrypting.
This must match the corresponding certificate.
If this option is not specified then the private key must be included
in the certificate file specified with
the

a message. 
.It Fl to , from , subject
The relevant mail headers.
These are included outside the signed
portion of a message so they may be included manually.
If signing, then many

address matches that specified in the From: address.
.Ed
.Sh SMIME NOTES
The
.Em MIME
message must be sent without any blank lines between the
headers and the output.
Some mail programs will automatically add a blank line.
Piping the mail directly to sendmail is one way to
achieve the correct format.
.Pp
The supplied message to be signed or encrypted must include the
necessary
.Em MIME
headers or many
.Em S/MIME
clients won't display it properly (if at all).
You can use the

.Pp
A "signed and encrypted" message is one where a signed message is
then encrypted.
This can be produced by encrypting an already signed message:
see the
.Sx SMIME EXAMPLES
section.
.Pp
This version of the program only allows one signer per message, but it
will verify multiple signers on received messages.
Some

clients choke if a message contains multiple signers.
It is possible to sign messages "in parallel" by signing an already
signed message.

.Sh SMIME BUGS
The
.Em MIME
parser isn't very clever: it seems to handle most messages that I've thrown
at it, but it may choke on others.
.Pp
The code currently will only write out the signer's certificate to a file:
if the signer has a separate encryption certificate this must be manually
extracted.
There should be some heuristic that determines the correct encryption
certificate.
.Pp
Ideally a database should be maintained of a certificate for each email
address.
.Pp
The code doesn't currently take note of the permitted symmetric encryption
algorithms as supplied in the
.Em SMIMECapabilities
signed attribute.
This means the user has to manually include the correct encryption algorithm.
It should store the list of permitted ciphers in a database and only use those.
.Pp
No revocation checking is done on the signer's certificate.
.Pp
The current code can only handle
.Em S/MIME
v2 messages, the more complex
.Em S/MIME
v3 structures may cause parsing errors.

.It Ar certificates

.Ed
.Sh VERIFY OPERATION
The
.Nm verify
program uses the same functions as the internal SSL and S/MIME verification,
therefore this description applies to these verify operations too.
.Pp
There is one crucial difference between the verify operations performed
by the
.Nm verify
program: wherever possible an attempt is made to continue
after an error, whereas normally the verify operation would halt on the
first error.
This allows all the problems with a certificate chain to be determined.
.Pp
The verify operation consists of a number of separate steps.
.Pp
Firstly a certificate chain is built up starting from the supplied certificate
and ending in the root CA.
It is an error if the whole chain cannot be built up.
The chain is built up by looking up the issuers certificate of the current
certificate.
If a certificate is found which is its own issuer it is assumed 
to be the root CA.
.Pp
The process of 'looking up the issuers certificate' itself involves a number
of steps.
In versions of
.Nm OpenSSL
before 0.9.5a the first certificate whose subject name matched the issuer
of the current certificate was assumed to be the issuers certificate.
In
.Nm OpenSSL
0.9.6 and later all certificates whose subject name matches the issuer name
of the current certificate are subject to further tests.
The relevant authority key identifier components of the current certificate
(if present) must match the subject key identifier (if present)
and issuer and serial number of the candidate issuer; in addition the
.Em keyUsage
extension of the candidate issuer (if present) must permit certificate signing.
.Pp
The lookup first looks in the list of untrusted certificates and if no match
is found the remaining lookups are from the trusted certificates.
The root CA is always looked up in the trusted certificate list: if the
certificate to verify is a root certificate, then an exact match must be
found in the trusted list.
.Pp
The second operation is to check every untrusted certificate's extensions for
consistency with the supplied purpose.
If the
.Fl purpose
option is not included, then no checks are done.
The supplied or "leaf" certificate must have extensions compatible with the
supplied purpose and all other certificates must also be valid
CA certificates.
The precise extensions required are described in more detail in
the
.Sx X509 CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS
section below.
.Pp
The third operation is to check the trust settings on the root CA.
The root CA should be trusted for the supplied purpose.
For compatibility with previous versions of
.Nm SSLeay
and
.Nm OpenSSL ,
a certificate with no trust settings is considered to be valid for
all purposes. 
.Pp
The final operation is to check the validity of the certificate chain.
The validity period is checked against the current system time and the
.Em notBefore
and
.Em notAfter
dates in the certificate.
The certificate signatures are also checked at this point.
.Pp
If all operations complete successfully, then the certificate is considered
valid.
If any operation fails then the certificate is not valid.
.Sh VERIFY DIAGNOSTICS
When a verify operation fails, the output messages can be somewhat cryptic.
The general form of the error message is:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& server.pem: /C=AU/ST=Queensland/O=CryptSoft Pty Ltd/CN=Test CA (1024 bit)
\& error 24 at 1 depth lookup:invalid CA certificate
.Ed
.Pp
The first line contains the name of the certificate being verified followed by
the subject name of the certificate.
The second line contains the error number and the depth.
The depth is number of the certificate being verified when a
problem was detected starting with zero for the certificate being verified
itself, then 1 for the CA that signed the certificate and so on.
Finally a text version of the error number is presented.
.Pp
An exhaustive list of the error codes and messages is shown below; this also
includes the name of the error code as defined in the header file
.Aq Pa x509_vfy.h .

.Ed
.Sh VERIFY BUGS
Although the issuer checks are a considerable improvement over the old
technique, they still suffer from limitations in the underlying
X509_LOOKUP API.
One consequence of this is that trusted certificates with matching subject
name must either appear in a file (as specified by the
.Fl CAfile
option) or a directory (as specified by
.Fl CApath ) .
If they occur in both, then only the certificates in the file will
be recognised.

assume certificates with matching subject name are identical and

Normally the command will expect an X509 certificate,
but this can change if other options such as
.Fl req
are present.
The
.Ar DER
format is the DER encoding of the certificate and
.Ar PEM
is the base64 encoding of the DER encoding with header and footer lines added.
The
.Ar NET
option is an obscure Netscape server format that is now
obsolete.
.It Fl outform Ar DER|PEM|NET
This specifies the output format;
the options have the same meaning as the 
.Fl inform
option.
.It Fl in Ar filename
This specifies the input
.Ar filename
to read a certificate from or standard input if this option is not specified.
.It Fl out Ar filename
This specifies the output
.Ar filename
to write to or standard output by default.
.It Fl md2|-md5|-sha1|-mdc2
The digest to use.
This affects any signing or display option that uses a message digest,
such as the
.Fl fingerprint , signkey
and
.Fl CA
options.
If not specified then MD5 is used.
If the key being used to sign with is a DSA key then
this option has no effect: SHA1 is always used with DSA keys.

.Sh X509 DISPLAY OPTIONS
.Sy Note :
The
.Fl alias
and
.Fl purpose
options are also display options but are described in the
.Sx X509 TRUST OPTIONS
section.
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Fl text
Prints out the certificate in text form.
Full details are output including the public key, signature algorithms,
issuer and subject names, serial number, any extensions present and any
trust settings.
.It Fl certopt Ar option
Customise the output format used with
.Fl text .
The
.Ar option
argument can be a single option or multiple options separated by commas.
The
.Fl certopt
switch may be also be used more than once to set multiple options.
See the
.Sx X509 TEXT OPTIONS
section for more information.
.It Fl noout
This option prevents output of the encoded version of the request.
.It Fl modulus
This option prints out the value of the modulus of the public key
contained in the certificate.
.It Fl serial
Outputs the certificate serial number.
.It Fl hash
Outputs the "hash" of the certificate subject name.
This is used in
.Nm OpenSSL
to form an index to allow certificates in a directory to be looked up
by subject name.
.It Fl subject
Outputs the subject name.
.It Fl issuer
Outputs the issuer name.
.It Fl nameopt Ar option
Option which determines how the subject or issuer names are displayed.
The
.Ar option
argument can be a single option or multiple options separated by commas.
Alternatively, the
.Fl nameopt
switch may be used more than once to set multiple options.
See the
.Sx X509 NAME OPTIONS
section for more information.
.It Fl email
Outputs the email address(es) if any.
.It Fl startdate
Prints out the start date of the certificate; that is, the
.Em notBefore
date.
.It Fl enddate
Prints out the expiry date of the certificate; that is, the
.Em notAfter
date.
.It Fl dates
Prints out the start and expiry dates of a certificate.
.It Fl fingerprint
Prints out the digest of the DER encoded version of the whole certificate
(see
.Sx DIGEST OPTIONS ) .
.It Fl C
This outputs the certificate in the form of a C source file.
.Ed
.Sh X509 TRUST SETTINGS
Please note these options are currently experimental and may well change.
.Pp
A
.Em trusted certificate
is an ordinary certificate which has several
additional pieces of information attached to it such as the permitted
and prohibited uses of the certificate and an "alias".
.Pp
Normally when a certificate is being verified at least one certificate
must be "trusted".
By default a trusted certificate must be stored
locally and must be a root CA: any certificate chain ending in this CA
is then usable for any purpose.
.Pp
Trust settings currently are only used with a root CA.
They allow a finer control over the purposes the root CA can be used for.
For example, a CA may be trusted for an SSL client but not for
SSL server use.
.Pp
See the description of the
.Nm verify
utility for more information on the meaning of trust settings.
.Pp
Future versions of
.Nm OpenSSL
will recognize trust settings on any certificate: not just root CAs.
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Fl trustout
This causes
.Nm x509
to output a
.Em trusted certificate .
An ordinary or trusted certificate can be input, but by default an ordinary
certificate is output and any trust settings are discarded.
With the
.Fl trustout
option a trusted certificate is output.
A trusted certificate is automatically output if any trust settings
are modified.
.It Fl setalias Ar arg
Sets the alias of the certificate.
This will allow the certificate to be referred to using a nickname,
for example "Steve's Certificate".
.It Fl alias
Outputs the certificate alias, if any.
.It Fl clrtrust
Clears all the permitted or trusted uses of the certificate.
.It Fl clrreject
Clears all the prohibited or rejected uses of the certificate.
.It Fl addtrust Ar arg
Adds a trusted certificate use.
Any object name can be used here, but currently only
.Ar clientAuth
.Po Em SSL
 client use
.Pc ,
.Ar serverAuth
.Po Em SSL
 server use
.Pc
and
.Ar emailProtection
.Po Em S/MIME
 email
.Pc
are used.
Other
.Nm OpenSSL
applications may define additional uses.
.It Fl addreject Ar arg
Adds a prohibited use.
It accepts the same values as the
.Fl addtrust
option.
.It Fl purpose
This option performs tests on the certificate extensions and outputs
the results.
For a more complete description see the
.Sx X509 CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS
section.
.Ed
.Sh X509 SIGNING OPTIONS
The
.Nm x509
utility can be used to sign certificates and requests: it
can thus behave like a "mini CA".
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Fl signkey Ar filename
This option causes the input file to be self-signed using the supplied
private key. 
.Pp
If the input file is a certificate, it sets the issuer name to the
subject name (i.e. makes it self-signed), changes the public key to the
supplied value and changes the start and end dates.
The start date is set to the current time and the end date is set to
a value determined by the
.Fl days
option.
Any certificate extensions are retained unless the
.Fl clrext
option is supplied.
.Pp
If the input is a certificate request, then a self-signed certificate
is created using the supplied private key using the subject name in
the request.
.It Fl clrext
Delete any extensions from a certificate.
This option is used when a certificate is being created from another
certificate (for example with the
.Fl signkey
or the
.Fl CA
options).
Normally all extensions are retained.
.It Fl keyform Ar PEM|DER
Specifies the format
.Po Em DER
 or
.Em PEM
.Pc
of the private key file used in the
.Fl signkey
option.
.It Fl days Ar arg
Specifies the number of days to make a certificate valid for.
The default is 30 days.
.It Fl x509toreq
Converts a certificate into a certificate request.
The
.Fl signkey
option is used to pass the required private key.
.It Fl req
By default a certificate is expected on input.
With this option a certificate request is expected instead.
.It Fl set_serial Ar n
Specifies the serial number to use.
This option can be used with either the
.Fl signkey
or
.Fl CA
options.
If used in conjunction with the
.Fl CA
option, the serial number file (as specified by the
.Fl CAserial
or
.Fl CAcreateserial
options) is not used.
.Pp
The serial number can be decimal or hex (if preceded by
.Em 0x ) .
Negative serial numbers can also be specified but their use is not recommended.
.It Fl CA Ar filename
Specifies the CA certificate to be used for signing.
When this option is present
.Nm x509
behaves like a "mini CA".
The input file is signed by the CA using this option;
that is, its issuer name is set to the subject name of the CA and it is
digitally signed using the CAs private key.
.Pp
This option is normally combined with the
.Fl req
option.
Without the
.Fl req
option, the input is a certificate which must be self-signed.
.It Fl CAkey Ar filename
Sets the CA private key to sign a certificate with.
If this option is not specified then it is assumed that the CA private key
is present in the CA certificate file.
.It Fl CAserial Ar filename
Sets the CA serial number file to use.
.Pp
When the
.Fl CA
option is used to sign a certificate it uses a serial
number specified in a file.
This file consist of one line containing an even number of hex digits
with the serial number to use.
After each use the serial number is incremented and written out
to the file again.
.Pp
The default filename consists of the CA certificate file base name with
.Pa .srl
appended.
For example if the CA certificate file is called 
.Pa mycacert.pem ,
it expects to find a serial number file called
.Pa mycacert.srl .
.It Fl CAcreateserial Ar filename
With this option the CA serial number file is created if it does not exist:
it will contain the serial number "02" and the certificate being signed will
have 1 as its serial number.
Normally if the
.Fl CA
option is specified and the serial number file does not exist it is an error.
.It Fl extfile Ar filename
File containing certificate extensions to use.
If not specified, then no extensions are added to the certificate.
.It Fl extensions Ar section
The section to add certificate extensions from.
If this option is not specified then the extensions should either be
contained in the unnamed (default) section or the default section should
contain a variable called "extensions" which contains the section to use.
.Ed
.Sh X509 NAME OPTIONS
The
.Fl nameopt
command line switch determines how the subject and issuer
names are displayed.
If no
.Fl nameopt
switch is present, the default "oneline"
format is used which is compatible with previous versions of
.Nm OpenSSL .
Each option is described in detail below, all options can be preceded by
a
.Cm \&-
to turn the option off.
Only the first four will normally be used.
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Ar compat
Use the old format.
This is equivalent to specifying no name options at all.
.It Ar RFC2253
Displays names compatible with RFC2253; equivalent to
.Ar esc_2253 , esc_ctrl ,
.Ar esc_msb , utf8 , dump_nostr , dump_unknown ,
.Ar dump_der , sep_comma_plus , dn_rev and sname .
.It Ar oneline
A oneline format which is more readable than RFC2253.
It is equivalent to specifying the
.Ar esc_2253 , esc_ctrl , esc_msb , utf8 ,
.Ar dump_nostr , dump_der , use_quote , sep_comma_plus_spc ,
.Ar spc_eq
and
.Ar sname
options.
.It Ar multiline
A multiline format.
It is equivalent to
.Ar esc_ctrl , esc_msb , sep_multiline ,
.Ar spc_eq , lname
and
.Ar align .
.It Ar esc_2253
Escape the "special" characters required by RFC2253 in a field that is
.Cm \& ,+"<>; .
Additionally,
.Cm \&#
is escaped at the beginning of a string
and a space character at the beginning or end of a string.
.It Ar esc_ctrl
Escape control characters.
That is, those with ASCII values less than
0x20 (space) and the delete (0x7f) character.
They are escaped using the RFC2253 \eXX notation (where XX are two hex
digits representing the character value).
.It Ar esc_msb
Escape characters with the MSB set; that is, with ASCII values larger than
127.
.It Ar use_quote
Escapes some characters by surrounding the whole string with
.Cm \&"
characters.
Without the option, all escaping is done with the
.Cm \&\e
character.
.It Ar utf8
Convert all strings to UTF8 format first.
This is required by RFC2253.
If you are lucky enough to have a UTF8 compatible terminal then the use
of this option (and
.Em not
setting
.Ar esc_msb )
may result in the correct display of multibyte (international) characters.
If this option is not present, then multibyte characters larger than 0xff
will be represented using the format \eUXXXX for 16 bits and \eWXXXXXXXX
for 32 bits.
Also, if this option is off, any UTF8Strings will be converted to their
character form first.
.It Ar no_type
This option does not attempt to interpret multibyte characters in any
way.
That is, their content octets are merely dumped as though one octet
represents each character.
This is useful for diagnostic purposes but will result in rather odd
looking output.
.It Ar show_type
Show the type of the ASN1 character string.
The type precedes the field contents.
For example "BMPSTRING: Hello World".
.It Ar dump_der
When this option is set, any fields that need to be hexdumped will
be dumped using the DER encoding of the field.
Otherwise just the content octets will be displayed.
Both options use the RFC2253 #XXXX... format.
.It Ar dump_nostr
Dump non-character string types (for example OCTET STRING); if this
option is not set then non-character string types will be displayed
as though each content octet represents a single character.
.It Ar dump_all
Dump all fields.
This option, when used with
.Ar dump_der ,
allows the DER encoding of the structure to be unambiguously determined.
.It Ar dump_unknown
Dump any field whose OID is not recognised by
.Nm OpenSSL .
.It Ar sep_comma_plus , sep_comma_plus_space , sep_semi_plus_space , sep_multiline
These options determine the field separators.
The first character is between RDNs and the second between multiple AVAs
(multiple AVAs are very rare and their use is discouraged).
The options ending in "space" additionally place a space after the
separator to make it more readable.
The
.Ar sep_multiline
uses a linefeed character for the RDN separator and a spaced
.Cm \&+
for the AVA separator.
It also indents the fields by four characters.
.It Ar dn_rev
Reverse the fields of the DN.
This is required by RFC2253.
As a side effect, this also reverses the order of multiple AVAs but this is
permissible.
.It Ar nofname , sname , lname , oid
These options alter how the field name is displayed.
.Ar nofname
does not display the field at all.
.Ar sname
uses the "short name" form (CN for
.Ar commonName ,
for example).
.Ar lname
uses the long form.
.Ar oid
represents the OID in numerical form and is useful for diagnostic purpose.
.It Ar align
Align field values for a more readable output.
Only usable with
.Ar sep_multiline .
.It Ar spc_eq
Places spaces round the
.Cm \&=
character which follows the field name.
.Ed
.Sh X509 TEXT OPTIONS
As well as customising the name output format, it is also possible to
customise the actual fields printed using the
.Fl certopt
options when the
.Fl text
option is present.
The default behaviour is to print all fields.
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.It Ar compatible
Use the old format.
This is equivalent to specifying no output options at all.
.It Ar no_header
Don't print header information: that is, the lines saying "Certificate"
and "Data".
.It Ar no_version
Don't print out the version number.
.It Ar no_serial
Don't print out the serial number.
.It Ar no_signame
Don't print out the signature algorithm used.
.It Ar no_validity
Don't print the validity; that is, the
.Em notBefore
and
.Em notAfter
fields.
.It Ar no_subject
Don't print out the subject name.
.It Ar no_issuer
Don't print out the issuer name.
.It Ar no_pubkey
Don't print out the public key.
.It Ar no_sigdump
Don't give a hexadecimal dump of the certificate signature.
.It Ar no_aux
Don't print out certificate trust information.
.It Ar no_extensions
Don't print out any X509V3 extensions.
.It Ar ext_default
Retain default extension behaviour: attempt to print out unsupported
certificate extensions.
.It Ar ext_error
Print an error message for unsupported certificate extensions.
.It Ar ext_parse
ASN1 parse unsupported extensions.
.It Ar ext_dump
Hex dump unsupported extensions.
.It Ar ca_default
The value used by the
.Nm ca
utility, equivalent to
.Ar no_issuer , no_pubkey , no_header ,
.Ar no_version , no_sigdump
and
.Ar no_signame .

.Sh X509 NOTES
The
.Em PEM
format uses the header and footer lines:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----
\& -----END CERTIFICATE----
.Ed
.Pp
It will also handle files containing:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& -----BEGIN X509 CERTIFICATE----
\& -----END X509 CERTIFICATE----
.Ed
.Pp
Trusted certificates have the lines:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
\& -----BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE----
\& -----END TRUSTED CERTIFICATE----
.Ed
.Pp
The conversion to UTF8 format used with the name options assumes that
T61Strings use the ISO8859-1 character set.
This is wrong, but Netscape and MSIE do this, as do many certificates.
So although this is incorrect
it is more likely to display the majority of certificates correctly.
.Pp
The
.Fl fingerprint
option takes the digest of the DER encoded certificate.
This is commonly called a "fingerprint".
Because of the nature of message digests, the fingerprint of a certificate
is unique to that certificate and two certificates with the same fingerprint
can be considered to be the same.
.Pp
The Netscape fingerprint uses MD5, whereas MSIE uses SHA1.
.Pp
The
.Fl email
option searches the subject name and the subject alternative
name extension.
Only unique email addresses will be printed out: it will
not print the same address more than once.
.Sh X509 CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS
The
.Fl purpose
option checks the certificate extensions and determines
what the certificate can be used for.
The actual checks done are rather
complex and include various hacks and workarounds to handle broken
certificates and software.
.Pp
The same code is used when verifying untrusted certificates in chains,
so this section is useful if a chain is rejected by the verify code.
.Pp
The
.Em basicConstraints
extension CA flag is used to determine whether the
certificate can be used as a CA.
If the CA flag is true then it is a CA,
if the CA flag is false then it is not a CA.
.Em All
CAs should have the CA flag set to true.
.Pp
If the
.Em basicConstraints
extension is absent then the certificate is
considered to be a "possible CA"; other extensions are checked according
to the intended use of the certificate.
A warning is given in this case because the certificate should really not
be regarded as a CA: however,
it is allowed to be a CA to work around some broken software.
.Pp
If the certificate is a V1 certificate (and thus has no extensions) and
it is self-signed, it is also assumed to be a CA but a warning is again
given: this is to work around the problem of Verisign roots which are V1
self-signed certificates.
.Pp
If the
.Em keyUsage
extension is present, then additional restraints are
made on the uses of the certificate.
A CA certificate
.Em must
have the
.Em keyCertSign
bit set if the
.Em keyUsage
extension is present.
.Pp
The extended key usage extension places additional restrictions on the
certificate uses.
If this extension is present (whether critical or not)
the key can only be used for the purposes specified.
.Pp
A complete description of each test is given below.
The comments about
.Em basicConstraints
and
.Em keyUsage
and V1 certificates above apply to

.It Ar SSL Client
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the

The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the
"web server authentication" and/or one of the SGC OIDs.
.Em keyUsage
must be absent or it must have the

.It Ar SSL Server CA
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the
"web server authentication" and/or one of the SGC OIDs.
Netscape certificate type must be absent or the SSL CA
bit must be set: this is used as a work around if the
.Em basicConstraints
extension is absent.
.It Ar Netscape SSL Server
For Netscape SSL clients to connect to an SSL server; it must have the
.Em keyEncipherment
bit set if the
.Em keyUsage
extension is present.
This isn't always valid because some cipher suites use the key for
digital signing.
Otherwise it is the same as a normal SSL server.
.It Ar Common S/MIME Client Tests
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the
"email protection" OID.
Netscape certificate type must be absent or should have the
.Em S/MIME
bit set.
If the
.Em S/MIME
bit is not set in netscape certificate type, then the SSL
client bit is tolerated as an alternative but a warning is shown:
this is because some Verisign certificates don't set the
.Em S/MIME
bit.
.It Ar S/MIME Signing
In addition to the common
.Em S/MIME
client tests, the
.Em digitalSignature
bit must be set if the
.Em keyUsage
extension is present.
.It Ar S/MIME Encryption
In addition to the common
.Em S/MIME
tests, the
.Em keyEncipherment
bit must be set if the
.Em keyUsage
extension is present.
.It Ar S/MIME CA
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the
"email protection" OID.
Netscape certificate type must be absent or must have the
.Em S/MIME CA
bit set: this is used as a work around if the
.Em basicConstraints
extension is absent. 
.It Ar CRL Signing
The
.Em keyUsage
extension must be absent or it must have the
.Em CRL
signing bit set.
.It Ar CRL Signing CA
The normal CA tests apply.
Except in this case the
.Em basicConstraints
extension must be present.
.Sh X509 BUGS
Extensions in certificates are not transferred to certificate requests and
vice versa.
.Pp
It is possible to produce invalid certificates or requests by specifying the
wrong private key or using inconsistent options in some cases: these should
be checked.
.Pp
There should be options to explicitly set such things as start and end dates,
rather than an offset from the current time.
.Pp
The code to implement the verify behaviour described in the
.Sx X509 TRUST SETTINGS
is currently being developed.
It thus describes the intended behaviour rather than the current behaviour.
It is hoped that it will represent reality in
.Nm OpenSSL
0.9.5 and later.
