.Ar command
.Op Ar arguments ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program controls the

daemon.
Commands to switch between displays may be abbreviated to the
minimum unambiguous prefix; for example,
.Cm s s
for
.Cm show summary .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Show neighbors' IP addresses instead of their description.
.It Fl o Ar directory
Use
.Ar directory
to write the filter files to in irrfilter mode.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use
.Ar socket
instead of the default
.Pa /var/run/bgpd.sock
to communicate with
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.El
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.It Cm fib couple
Insert the learned routes into the Forwarding Information Base
a.k.a. the kernel routing table.
.It Cm fib decouple
Remove the learned routes from the Forwarding Information Base
a.k.a. the kernel routing table.
.It Xo
.Cm irrfilter
.Ar as
.Op Ar options
.Xc
Get the
.Em aut-num
object from the
.Em Internet Routing Registry
and generate bgpd filters from the policy specified therein.
The aut-num object as well as the associated as-set and route objects
have to be in RPSL format.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm up
Take the BGP session to the specified neighbor up.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address or description.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm down
Take the BGP session to the specified neighbor down.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address or description.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm clear
Stop and restart the BGP session to the specified neighbor.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address or description.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm refresh

.It Cm network add Ar prefix
Add the specified prefix to the list of announced networks.
.It Cm network delete Ar prefix
Remove the specified prefix from the list of announced networks.
.It Cm network flush

.Ar family ,
if given, limits the output to the given address family.
The supported families are
.Em inet
and
.Em inet6 .
.It Cm reload
Reload the configuration file.
.It Cm show fib Ar filter
Show routes from
.Xr bgpd 8 Ns 's
view of the Forwarding Information Base.

according to the given
.Ar modifier :

.Bl -tag -width messages -compact
.It Cm messages
Show statistics about sent and received BGP messages.
.It Cm terse
Show statistics in an easily parseable terse format.
The printed numbers are the sent and received open, sent and received
