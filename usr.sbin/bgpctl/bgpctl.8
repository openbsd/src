.Nm bgpctl
.Nd control the Border Gateway Protocol daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bgpctl
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program controls the
.Xr bgpd 8
daemon.
Commands may be abbreviated to the minimum unambiguous prefix; for example,
.Cm s s
for
.Cm show summary .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Show neighbors' IP addresses instead of their description.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use
.Ar socket
to communicate with
.Xr bgpd 8
instead of the default
.Pa /var/run/bgpd.sock.<rdomain>
where
.Ar <rdomain>
is the routing domain
.Nm
is running in.
To administer
.Xr bgpd 8
in a different routing domain, run
.Nm
in said routing domain.
.El
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.It Xo
.Cm fib
.Op Cm table Ar number
.Cm couple
.Xc
Insert the learned routes into the specified Forwarding Information Base
a.k.a. the kernel routing table.
.It Xo
.Cm fib
.Op Cm table Ar number
.Cm decouple
.Xc
Remove the learned routes from the specified Forwarding Information Base
a.k.a. the kernel routing table.
.It Xo
.Cm irrfilter
.Op Ar options
.Ar as
.Op Ar arguments
.Xc
Get the
.Em aut-num
object from the
.Em Internet Routing Registry
and generate bgpd filters from the policy specified therein.
The aut-num object as well as the associated as-set and route objects
have to be in RPSL format.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar directory
Use
.Ar directory
to write the filter files to.
.It Fl 4
Fetch only IPv4 prefixes from the registry.

.El
.It Cm log brief
Disable verbose debug logging.
.It Cm log verbose
Enable verbose debug logging.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm clear Op Ar reason
Stop and restart the BGP session to the specified neighbor.
If a
.Ar reason
is provided, the

The
.Ar reason
cannot exceed 128 octets.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address or description.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm destroy
Destroy a previously cloned peer.
The peer must be down before calling this function.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address or description.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm down Op Ar reason
Take the BGP session to the specified neighbor down.
If a
.Ar reason
is provided, the
.Ar reason
is sent as Administrative Shutdown Communication to the neighbor.
The
.Ar reason
cannot exceed 128 octets.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address or description.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm refresh
Request the neighbor to re-send all routes.
Note that the neighbor is not obliged to re-send all routes, or any routes at
all, even if it announced the route refresh capability.

.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm up
Bring the BGP session to the specified neighbor up.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address or description.
