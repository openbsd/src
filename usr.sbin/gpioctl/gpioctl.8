.Sh NAME
.Nm gpioctl
.Nd control GPIO devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm gpioctl
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Ar pin
.Op Ar 0 | 1 | 2
.Nm gpioctl
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Fl c
.Ar pin
.Op Ar flags
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program allows manipulation of
.Tn GPIO
(General Purpose Input/Output) device pins.
Such devices can be either part of the chipset or embedded
.Tn CPU ,
or a separate chip.
The usual way of using
.Tn GPIO
is to connect some simple devices such as LEDs, 1-wire thermal sensors,
etc., to its pins.
.Pp
Each
.Tn GPIO
device has an associated device file in the
.Pa /dev
directory.
By default
.Nm
uses
.Pa /dev/gpio0 ,
which corresponds to the first found
.Tn GPIO
device in the system.
.Pp
.Tn GPIO
pins can be either
.Dq read
or
.Dq written
with the values of logical 0 or 1.
If only a
.Ar pin
number is specified on the command line, the pin state will be read
from the
.Tn GPIO
controller and displayed.
To write to a pin, a value must be specified after the
.Ar pin
number.
Values can be either 0 or 1.
A value of 2 has a special meaning: it
.Dq toggles
the pin, i.e. changes its state to the opposite.
.Pp
The following configuration
.Ar flags
are supported by the
.Tn GPIO
framework:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It in
input direction
.It out
output direction
.It inout
bi-directional
.It od
open-drain output
.It pp
push-pull output
.It tri
tri-state (output disabled)
.It pu
internal pull-up enabled
.El
.Pp
Note that not all the flags can be supported by the particular
.Tn GPIO
controller.
.Pp
When executed without any arguments,
.Nm
reads information about the
.Tn GPIO
device and displays it.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar pin
Configure
.Ar pin
with any of the various flags,
as documented above.
The list of supported flags is always displayed when executing
.Nm
with this option.
To change pin flags,
a new flags set separated by spaces must be specified
after the pin number.
.It Fl d Ar device
If more than one
.Tn GPIO
device is present, an alternative
.Ar device
file can be specified with the
.Fl d
option in order to access a particular
.Tn GPIO
device.
.It Fl q
Operate quietly i.e. nothing is printed to stdout.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/gpiou" -compact
.It /dev/gpio Ns Ar u
GPIO device unit
.Ar u
file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configure pin 20 to have push-pull output:
.Pp
.Dl # gpioctl -c 20 out pp
.Pp
Write logical 1 to pin 20:
.Pp
.Dl # gpioctl 20 1
