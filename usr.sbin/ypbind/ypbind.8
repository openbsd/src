.Sh NAME
.Nm ypbind
.Nd create and maintain a binding to a YP server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ypbind
.Op Fl ypset
.Nm ypbind
.Op Fl ypsetme
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Ypbind
finds the server for a particular YP domain and stores information about it
in a
.Pa binding file.
This binding information includes the IP address of the server associated with
that particular domain and which port the server is using.  This information
is stored in the directory
.Pa /var/yp/binding
in a file named with the convention
.Pa domainname.version.
(The YP system only supplies information on version 2.)
.Pp
When
.Nm ypbind
starts, it broadcasts looking for a process willing to serve maps for the
client's domain.  Once a binding is established,
.Nm ypbind
maintains this binding by periodically communicating with the server to which
it is bound.  If the binding is somehow lost, e.g by server reboot,
.Nm ypbind
marks the domain as unbound and attempts to re-establish the binding.
When the binding is once again successful,
.Nm ypbind
marks the domain as bound and resumes its periodic check.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl ypset
.Xr ypset 8
may be used to change the server to which a domain is bound.
.It Fl ypsetme
.Xr ypset 8
may be used only from this machine to change the server
to which a domain is bound.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl ypset
and
.Fl ypsetme
options are dangerous and should be avoided.
.Pp
If the directory
.Pa /var/yp/binding
exists, YP is started automatically at boot time by
.Pa /etc/rc .
.Sh FILES
.Pa /var/yp/binding/domainname.version
- binding file for domainname
