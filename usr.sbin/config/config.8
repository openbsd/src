.Dt CONFIG 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm config
.Nd "build kernel compilation directories or modify a kernel"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm config
.Op Fl b Ar builddir
.Op Fl s Ar srcdir
.Op Fl p
.Op Ar config-file
.Nm config
.Fl e
.Op Fl f | Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Fl u
.Ar infile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In the first synopsis form, the
.Nm
program creates a kernel build directory from the kernel configuration file
specified by
.Ar config-file .
In the second synopsis form,
.Nm
allows editing of the kernel binary specified by
.Ar infile .
Devices may be enabled, disabled, or modified without recompiling (see
.Xr boot_config 8 ) .
.Pp
.Nm
is most commonly invoked from the directory containing
.Ox
kernel configuration files (i.e.,
.Pa /sys/arch/i386/conf
for i386 machines).
For instance, the following steps would be followed to configure and compile
a new GENERIC kernel (assuming a complete kernel source tree is available in
.Pa /sys ) :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cd /sys/arch/i386/conf
# config ./GENERIC
# cd ../compile/GENERIC
# make depend && make
.Ed
.Pp
Replace
.Dq i386
with the appropriate architecture name.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e
Allows the modification of kernel device configuration (see
.Xr boot_config 8 ) .
Temporary changes can be made to the running kernel's configuration or a new
kernel binary may be written for permanent changes between system reboots.
See the section
.Sx Kernel modification
below for more details.
.It Fl f
Overwrite the
.Ar infile
kernel binary with the modified kernel.
Otherwise,
.Fl o
should be given to specify an alternate output file.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Write the modified kernel to
.Ar outfile .
.It Fl u
Check to see if the kernel configuration was modified at boot-time
(i.e.,
.Cm boot -c
was used).
If so, compare the running kernel with the kernel to be edited
.Pq Ar infile .
If they seem to be the same, apply all configuration changes performed at
boot.
.It Fl b Ar builddir
Create the build directory in the path specified by
.Ar builddir
instead of the default
.Pa ../compile/SYSTEMNAME .
.It Fl s Ar srcdir
Use
.Ar srcdir
as the top-level kernel source directory instead of the default (four
directories above the build directory).
.It Fl p
Configure for a system that includes profiling code; see
.Xr kgmon 8
and
.Xr gprof 1 .
When this option is specified,
.Nm
acts as if the lines
.Dq makeoptions PROF="-pg"
and
.Dq options GPROF
appeared in the specified kernel configuration file.
In addition,
.Dq .PROF
is appended to the default compliation directory name.
.Pp
The
.Fl p
flag is expected to be used for
.Dq one-shot
profiles of existing systems; for regular profiling, it is probably wiser to
make a separate configuration containing the makeoptions line.
.El
.Pp
The old
.Fl g
flag is deprecated and no longer supported.
Instead, add
.Dq makeoptions DEBUG="-g"
to the kernel configuration file, along with (typically)
.Dq options KGDB .
.Pp
The output of
.Nm
consists of a number of files, principally
.Pa ioconf.c
(a description of I/O devices that may be attached to the system)
and a
.Pa Makefile ,
used by
.Xr make 1
when building the kernel.
.Pp
After running
.Nm
it is wise to run
.Dq make depend
in the new build directory.
.Nm
prints a reminder of this when it completes.
.Pp
If
.Nm
stops due to errors, the problems reported should be corrected and
.Nm
should be run again.
.Nm
attempts to avoid changing the compilation directory if there are
configuration errors, but this code is not well-tested and some problems
(such as running out of disk space) are unrecoverable.
.Pp
If
.Ar config-file
is not specified,
.Nm
uses the current directory as the build directory, and looks in it for
a file called
.Pa CONFIG .
If you run
.Nm
this way, you must specify the location of the top-level kernel source
directory using the
.Fl s
option or by using the
.Dq Li source
directive at the beginning of the system configuration file.
.Ss Kernel modification
When
.Fl e
is specified, device parameters that are normally hard-coded into the kernel
may be changed.
This is useful to avoid the need for kernel recompilation or rebooting.
Modifications are made to the currently running kernel and can be written to
a new kernel binary so changes are preserved during subsequent system restarts.
.Pp
When invoked, the kernel identification is first shown.

.Sh EXAMPLES (First synopsis)
A custom kernel is built in the following way.
.Pp
To compile your own kernel from a non-writeable media (such as a CDROM)
mounted on
.Pa /usr/src ,
do the following:
.Sm off
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Li #\  Xo
.Ic cd\ /
.Ar somedir
.Xc
.Li #\  Xo
.Ic cp\ /usr/src/sys/arch/
.Ar somearch
.Ic /conf/
.Ar SOMEFILE
.Ic \ .
.Xc
.Li #\  Xo
.Ic vi\ \&
.Ar SOMEFILE
.No \ \ \ (to\ make\ any\ changes)
.Xc
.Li #\  Xo
.Ic config\ -s\ /usr/src/sys\ -b\ .\ \&
.Ar SOMEFILE
.Xc
.Li #\  Xo
.Ic make
.Xc
.Ed
.Sm on
.Pp
To compile a kernel inside a writable source tree, do the following:
.Sm off
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Li #\  Xo
.Ic cd\ /usr/src/sys/arch/
.Ar somearch
.Ic /conf
.Xc
.Li #\  Xo
.Ic vi\ \&
.Ar SOMEFILE
.No \ \ \ (to\ make\ any\ changes)
.Xc
.Li #\  Xo
.Ic config\ \&
.Ar SOMEFILE
.Xc
.Li #\  Xo
.Ic cd\ ../compile/
.Ar SOMEFILE
.Xc
.Li #\  Xo
.Ic make
.Xc
.Ed
.Sm on
.Pp
where
.Ar somedir
is a writable directory,
.Ar somearch
is the architecture (e.g.,
.Ic i386 ) ,
and
.Ar SOMEFILE
should be a name indicative of a particular configuration (often
that of the hostname).
.Nm config
will warn you if a
.Ar "make clean"
is required; 
you can also do a
.Ic make depend
so that you will have dependencies there the next time you do a compile.
.Pp
After either of these two methods, you can place the new kernel (called
.Pa bsd )
in
.Pa /
(i.e.,
.Pa /bsd )
and the system will boot it next time.
Most people save their backup kernels as
.Pa /bsd.1 ,
.Pa /bsd.2 ,
etc.
.Sh EXAMPLES (Second synopsis)
The Ethernet card is not detected at boot because the kernel configuration
does not match the physical hardware configuration,
e.g., wrong IRQ in OpenBSD/i386.
The Ethernet card is supposed to use the
.Xr ne 4
driver.
.Pp

.Ed
.Pp
ne1 seems to match the configuration except it uses IRQ 5 instead of IRQ 10.
So the irq on ne1 should be changed via the
.Ic change
command.
The device can be specified by either name or number.
.Pp
.Bd -literal
.No ukc> Ic change ne1

25 ne1 changed
25 ne1 at isa0 port 0x300 size 0 iomem -1 iosiz 0 irq 5 drq -1 drq2 -1
ukc>
.Ed
.Pp
Another case is a mistakenly detected non-existing device instead of another
device at the probed location.
One known case is the Mitsumi
CD-ROM in OpenBSD/i386.
The simplest thing to solve that problem is to disable mcd0.
.Pp
.Bd -literal
.No ukc> Ic find mcd0
 29 mcd0 at isa0 port 0x300 size 0 iomem -1 iosiz 0 irq 10 drq -1 drq2 -1
.No ukc> Ic disable mcd0
 29 mcd0 disabled
.No ukc> Ic find 29
 29 mcd0 at isa0 disable port 0x300 size 0 iomem -1 iosiz 0 irq 10 drq -1 drq2 -1
.Ed
.Pp
It's also possible to disable all devices with a common attribute. e.g.,
.Pp
.Bd -literal
.No ukc> Ic disable port 0x300
 25 ne1 disabled
 29 mcd0 alredy disabled
 72 we1 disabled
 75 el0 disabled
 77 ie1 disabled
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Cm show
command is useful for finding which devices have a certain attribute.
It can also be used to find those devices with a particular value for
an attribute.

It is possible to add new devices, but only devices that were linked into the
kernel.
If a new device is added, following devices will be renumbered.
