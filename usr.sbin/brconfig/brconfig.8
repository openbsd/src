.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm brconfig
utility retrieves kernel state of bridge interfaces and allows
user control of these bridges.  In the first synopsis, the command
will list the status of all bridges in the system.
In the second, its command line consists
of the name of a bridge and a set of operations to be
performed on that bridge.  The commands are executed in
the order they were specified.  If no command is specified in
the second synopsis, the
.Nm brconfig
will display status information about the bridge.
.Pp
The available commands are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar up
Start the bridge forwarding packets.
.It Ar down
Stop the bridge from forwarding packets.
.It Ar addr
Display the addresses that have been learned by the bridge.
.It Ar add interface-name
Add the interface named by
.Ar interface-name
as a member of the bridge.
The interface is put into promiscuous mode so
that it can receive every packet sent on the
network.
.It Ar delete interface-name
Remove the interface named by
.Ar interface-name
from the bridge.
Promiscuous mode is turned off for the interface when it is
removed from the bridge.
.It Ar del
Alias for `delete'.
.It Ar maxaddr size
Set the address cache size to
.Cm size .
The default is 100 entries.
.It Ar timeout time
Set the timeout, in seconds, for addresses in the cache to
.Cm time .
The default is 240 seconds.
If
.Cm time
is set to zero, then entries will not be expired.
.It Ar static interface-name address
Add a static entry into the address cache pointing to
.Cm interface-name .
Static entries are never aged out of the cache or replaced if the address
is seen on a different interface.
.It Ar deladdr address
Delete an address from the cache.
.It Ar flush
Remove all dynamically learned addresses from the cache.
.It Ar flushall
Remove all addresses from the cache including static addresses.
.It Ar learn interface
Mark an interface so that the source address of packets received from
.Cm interface
are entered into the address cache.
This is the default for interfaces added to the bridge.
.It Ar -learn interface
Mark an interface so that the source address of packets received from
.Cm interface
are not entered into the address cache.
.It Ar link0
Setting this flag stops all non-IP multicast packets from
being forwarded by the bridge.
.It Ar -link0
Clear the
.Ar link0
flag on the bridge interface.
.It Ar link1
Setting this flags stops all IP multicast packets from
being forwarded by the bridge.
.It Ar -link0
Clear the
.Ar link1
flag on the bridge interface.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width brconfig
.It Cm brconfig bridge0 add rl0 add xl0 up
Add the Ethernet interfaces rl0 and xl0 to the bridge bridge0, and
start the bridge forwarding packets.
.It Cm brconfig bridge0
Retrieve a list of interfaces that are members of bridge0, and the addresses
learned by the bridge.
.It Cm brconfig bridge0 down
Stop bridge0 from forwarding packets.
.It Cm brconfig bridge0 delete xl0
Remove the interface xl0 from the bridge bridge0.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm brconfig
first appeared in
.Ox 2.5 .
.Sh AUTHOR
The
.Xr brconfig 8
command and the
.Xr bridge 4
kernel interface were written by Jason L. Wright <jason@thought.net> as
part of an undergraduate indenpendent study
at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
.Sh BUGS
There are some network interface chipsets which will not work in a bridge
configuration.  Some, like the Lite-On PNIC, have serious flaws when
running in promiscuous mode, and others, like the TI ThunderLAN, receive
their own transmissions, which makes the address learning code ineffective.
