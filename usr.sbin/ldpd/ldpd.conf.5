.Sh NAME
.Nm ldpd.conf
.Nd Label Distribution Protocol daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ldpd 8
daemon implements the Label Distribution Protocol as described in RFC 5036.
.Pp
The
.Nm
config file is divided into the following main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr ldpd 8 .
.It Sy Address-Family Configuration
Address-family specific parameters.
.It Sy Interfaces Configuration
Interface-specific parameters.
.It Sy Targeted Neighbors Configuration
Targeted neighbor specific parameters.
.It Sy Neighbors Configuration
Neighbor-specific parameters.
.It Sy Layer 2 VPNs Configuration
Layer 2 VPNs parameters as per RFC 4447.
.El
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/ldpd.sub.conf"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Much like
.Xr cpp 1
or
.Xr m4 1 ,
macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic neighbor ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
peer1="10.0.1.5"
neighbor $peer1 {
	password "openbsd"
}
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
Several settings can be configured globally or within a more restricted scope,
like per address-family or per interface.
The only settings that can be set globally and not overruled are listed below.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic ds-cisco-interop
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
Cisco non-compliant format will be used to send and interpret the Dual-Stack
capability TLV.
The default is
.Ic no .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic fib-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
do not update the Label Forwarding Information Base, a.k.a. the kernel routing
table.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Ic rdomain Ar tableid
Specifies the routing table
.Xr ldpd 8
should modify.
Table 0 is the default table.
.Pp
.It Ic router-id Ar address
Set the router ID; in combination with labelspace it forms the LSR-ID.
If not specified, the numerically lowest IP address of the router will be used.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic transport-preference
.Pq Ic ipv4 Ns | Ns Ic ipv6
.Xc
Specify the preferred address-family for TCP transport connections.
If two dual-stack LSRs preferences does not match, no LDP session will
be established.
The default is
.Ic ipv6 .
.El
.Sh ADDRESS-FAMILY CONFIGURATION
Each address-family can have several parameters configured
individually, otherwise they are inherited.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
address-family ipv6 {
	explicit-null yes
	transport-address 2001:db8::50
	interface em0
}
.Ed
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic explicit-null
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
advertise explicit-null labels in place of implicit-null labels for directly
connected prefixes.
The default is
.Ic no .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic gtsm-enable
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
.Xr ldpd 8
will use the GTSM procedures described in RFC 6720 (for the IPv4 address-family)
and RFC 7552 (for the IPv6 address-family).
.Pp
Since GTSM is mandatory for LDPv6, the only effect of disabling GTSM for the
IPv6 address-family is that
.Xr ldpd 8
will not check the incoming packets' hop limit.
Outgoing packets will still be sent using a hop limit of 255 to guarantee
interoperability.
.Pp
If GTSM is enabled, multi-hop neighbors should have either GTSM disabled
individually or configured with an appropriate gtsm-hops distance.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Ic keepalive Ar seconds
Set the keepalive timeout in seconds.
The default value is 180; valid range is 3\-65535.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic targeted-hello-accept
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
allow LDP sessions to be established with remote neighbors that have not been
specifically configured.
The default is
.Ic no .
.Pp
.It Ic transport-address Ar address
Set the local address to be used in the TCP sessions.
For the IPv4 address-family, the router-id will be used if this option is not specified.
For the IPv6 address-family, this option must be specified.
.El
.Sh INTERFACES
Each interface can have several parameters configured individually, otherwise
they are inherited.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
address-family ipv4 {
	interface em0 {
		link-hello-holdtime 9
		link-hello-interval 3
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
Interface-specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic link-hello-holdtime Ar seconds
Set the hello holdtime in seconds.
The maximum time
.Xr ldpd 8
will wait between two consecutive hello messages from a peer before it is
marked as being down.
The default value is 15; valid range is 3\-65535.
.It Ic link-hello-interval Ar seconds
Set the hello interval in seconds.
The default value is 5; valid range is 1\-65535.
.El
.Sh TARGETED NEIGHBORS
Each targeted neighbor can have several parameters configured individually,
otherwise they are inherited.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
address-family ipv4 {
	targeted-neighbor A.B.C.D {
		targeted-hello-holdtime 90
		targeted-hello-interval 10
	}
}
address-family ipv6 {
	targeted-neighbor 2001:db8::1
}
.Ed
.Pp
Targeted-neighbor specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic targeted-hello-holdtime Ar seconds
Set the hello holdtime in seconds.
The maximum time
.Xr ldpd 8
will wait between two consecutive hello messages from a peer before it is
marked as being down.
The default value is 45.
.It Ic targeted-hello-interval Ar seconds
Set the hello interval in seconds.
The default value is 5; valid range is 1\-65535.
.El
.Sh NEIGHBORS
The
.Ic neighbor
section allows for the configuration of neighbor-specific parameters.
Note, however, that
.Xr ldpd 8
uses the hello discovery mechanism to discover its neighbors.
Without an underlying adjacency these commands have no effect.
A neighbor is identified by its LSR-ID, not by its remote address.
The neighbor-specific parameters apply for both LDPoIPv4 and LDPoIPv6 sessions.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
neighbor A.B.C.D {
}
.Ed
.Pp
Neighbor-specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic keepalive Ar seconds
Set the keepalive timeout in seconds.
Inherited from the global configuration if not given.
Valid range is 3\-65535.
.It Xo
.Ic gtsm-enable
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
Override the inherited configuration and enable/disable GTSM for this neighbor.
.It Ic gtsm-hops Ar hops
Set the maximum number of hops the neighbor may be away.
When GTSM is enabled for this neighbor, incoming packets are required to have
a TTL/hop limit of 256 minus this value, ensuring they have not passed
through more than the expected number of hops.
The default value is 1; valid range is 1\-255.
.It Ic password Ar secret
Enable TCP MD5 signatures per RFC 5036.
.El
.Sh LAYER 2 VPNS
.Xr ldpd 8
implements the signaling of pseudowires which can be used to
implement either the VPWS solution (also known as PWE3) or the VPLS
solution.
Currently only the VPLS solution is supported.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
l2vpn name type vpls {
        bridge bridge0
        interface em1
        pseudowire mpw1 {
                pw-id 100
                neighbor-id 192.168.1.10
        }
        pseudowire mpw2 {
                pw-id 200
                neighbor-id 10.0.1.5
        }
}
.Ed
.Pp
Layer 2 VPN specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic bridge Ar interface
Set the bridge interface the VPLS is associated with.
This parameter is optional and is only used to remove MAC addresses received
from MAC address withdrawal messages.
Only one bridge interface can be set.
.It Ic interface Ar interface
Configure a non pseudowire interface pertaining to the VPLS.
This parameter is optional and is only used to send MAC address withdrawal
messages when the specified interface is shutdown.
Multiple interfaces can be configured.
.It Ic mtu Ar number
Set the MTU advertised in the pseudowires.
Local and remote MTUs must match for a pseudowire to be set up.
The default value is 1500.
.It Xo

Specify the type of the configured pseudowires.
The type must be the same at both endpoints.
The default is
.Ic ethernet .
.El
.Sh PSEUDOWIRES
Each
.Xr mpw 4
pseudowire interface can have several parameters configured individually,
otherwise they are inherited.
A pseudowire interface is specified by its name.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pseudowire mpw5 {
	pw-id 5000
	neighbor-id 172.16.1.50
}
