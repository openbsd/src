.Dt PKG_INFO 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_info
.Nd a utility for displaying information on software packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_info
.Bk -words
.Op Fl AacDdfIiKkLMPpqRrSsUv
.Op Fl E Ar filename
.Op Fl e Ar pkg-name
.Op Fl l Ar str
.Op Fl Q Ar query
.Op Ar pkg-name
.Op Ar ...
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to dump out information for packages, as created by
.Xr pkg_create 1 ,
which may be still
packed up or already installed on the system with the
.Xr pkg_add 1
command.
.Pp
The
.Ar pkg-name
may be the name of an installed package, the pathname to a package
distribution file, or a URL to a package available through FTP, HTTP, or SCP.
.Nm
will try to complete
.Ar pkg-name
with a version number while looking through installed packages.
.Pp
When browsing through uninstalled packages, running
.Ic pkg_info -I *.tgz
will report a summary line for each package, so that it is possible to
run
.Ic pkg_info pkgname.tgz
to obtain a longer package description, and
.Ic pkg_add -n pkgname.tgz
to check that the installation would proceed cleanly, including dependencies.
.Pp
The following command-line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A
Show information for all currently installed packages,
including internal packages.
.It Fl a
Show information for all currently installed packages.
.It Fl c
Show the one-line comment field for each package.
.It Fl D
Show the install-message file (if any) for each package (deprecated option).
.It Fl d
Show the long-description field for each package.
.It Fl E Ar filename
Look for the package(s) that contains the given
.Ar filename .
.It Fl e Ar pkg-name
This option
allows you to test for the presence of another (perhaps
prerequisite) package from a script.
If the package identified by
.Ar pkg-name
is currently installed, return 0, otherwise return 1.
In addition, the names of any package(s) found installed are printed to
stdout unless turned off using the
.Fl q
option.
.Pp
The given
.Ar pkg-name
is actually a package specification, as described in
.Xr packages-specs 7 .
For example,
.Ic pkg_info -e 'name->=1.3'
will match versions 1.3 and later of the
.Pa name
package.
.It Fl e Ar pkg-path
Another variant of this option that uses a package path instead.
A package path is a location within the ports tree, as described
in
.Ev FULLPKGPATH
in
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 .
For example,
.Ic pkg_info -e x11/kde/base3
will match any package that was compiled according to
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde/base3 .
.It Fl f
Show the packing list instructions for each package.
.It Fl I
Show the index entry for each package.
.It Fl i
Show the install script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl K
Prefix file names with category keyword (e.g., @file, @lib).
Always used together with
.Fl L .
.It Fl k
Show the de-install script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl L
Show the files within each package.
This is different from just
viewing the packing list, since full pathnames for everything
are generated.
.It Fl l Ar str
Prefix each information category header (see
.Fl q )
shown with
.Ar str .
This is primarily of use to front-end programs that want to request a
lot of different information fields at once for a package, but don't
necessarily want the output intermingled in such a way that they can't
organize it.
This lets you add a special token to the start of each field.
.It Fl M
Show the install-message file (if any) for each package.
.It Fl P
Show the pkgpath for each package.
You can easily build a subdirlist with this.
.It Fl p
Show the installation prefix for each package.
.It Fl Q Ar query
Show all packages in $PKG_PATH which match the given
.Ar query .
.It Fl q
Be
.Dq quiet
in emitting report headers and such, just dump the
raw info (basically, assume a non-human reading).
.It Fl R
Show which packages require a given package.
.It Fl r
Show the requirements script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl S
Show the package signature for each package.
This signature is a unique tag showing the package name, and the version number
of every dependency and shared library necessary to build this package.
.It Fl s
Show an estimate of the total size of each package.
.It Fl U
Show the deinstall-message file (if any) for each package.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PKG_TMPDIR
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
The standard package database directory,
.Pa /var/db/pkg ,
can be overridden by specifying an alternative directory in the
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
environment variable.
.It Ev PKG_PATH
This can be used to specify a colon-separated list of paths to search for
package files.
The current directory is always searched first, even if
.Ev PKG_PATH
is set.
If
.Ev PKG_PATH
is used, the suffix
.Dq .tgz
is automatically appended to the
.Ar pkg-name ,
whereas searching in the current directory uses
.Ar pkg-name
literally.
.It Ev PKG_TMPDIR
Temporary area where package information files will be extracted, instead of
.Pa /var/tmp .
.El
.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
Package info is either extracted from package files named on the
command line, or from already installed package information
in
.Pa /var/db/pkg/<pkg-name> .
