.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to create packages that will subsequently be fed to
one of the package extraction/info utilities.
The input description
and command line arguments for the creation of a package are not
really meant to be human-generated, though it is easy enough to
do so.
It is more expected that you will use a front-end tool for
the job rather than muddling through it yourself.
Nonetheless, a short
description of the input syntax is included in this document.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar packinglist
Fetch
.Dq packing list
for package from the file
.Ar packinglist
or stdin if
.Ar packinglist
is a dash
.Dq \&- .
.It Fl c [ Ar \&- ] Ns Ar desc
Fetch package
.Dq one line description
from file
.Ar desc
or, if preceded by
.Dq \&- ,
the argument itself.
This string should also
give some idea of which version of the product (if any) the package
represents.
.It Fl d [ Ar \&- ] Ns Ar desc
Fetch long description for package from file
.Ar desc
or, if preceded by
.Dq \&- ,
the argument itself.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl h
Force
.Xr tar
to follow symbolic links, so that the files they point to
are dumped, rather than the links themselves (deprecated).
.It Fl i Ar iscript
Set
.Ar iscript
to be the install procedure for the package.
This can be any executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically
when the package is later installed.
.It Fl P Ar dpkgs
Set the initial package dependency list to
.Ar dpkgs 
(deprecated).
.It Fl C Ar cpkgs
Set the initial package conflict list to
.Ar cpkgs 
(deprecated).
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Set
.Ar prefix
as the initial directory
.Dq base
to start from in selecting files for
the package, and to record as the base for installing the package.
.It Fl S Ar fake-base
Set
.Ar fake-base
as the prefix to prepend to any file to select for the package.
.It Fl k Ar dscript
Set
.Ar dscript
to be the de-install procedure for the package.
This can be any executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically
when the package is later (if ever) de-installed.
.It Fl r Ar rscript
Set
.Ar rscript
to be the
.Dq requirements
procedure for the package.
This can be any executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically
at installation/deinstallation time to determine whether or not
installation/deinstallation should proceed.
.It Fl D Ar displayfile
Display the file (using
.Xr more 1 )
after installing the package.
Useful for things like
legal notices on almost-free software, etc.
.El
.Sh PACKING LIST DETAILS
The
.Dq packing list
format (see
.Fl f )
is fairly simple, being
nothing more than a single column of filenames to include in the
package.
However, since absolute pathnames are generally a bad idea
for a package that could be installed potentially anywhere, there is
another method of specifying where things are supposed to go
and, optionally, what ownership and mode information they should be
installed with.
This is done by imbedding specialized command sequences
in the packing list.
Briefly described, these sequences are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm @cwd Ar directory
Set the internal directory pointer to point to
.Ar directory .
All subsequent filenames will be assumed relative to this directory.
Note:
.Cm @cd
is also an alias for this command.
.It Cm @exec Ar command
Execute
.Ar command
as part of the unpacking process.
If
.Ar command
contains any of the following sequences somewhere in it, they will
be expanded inline.
For the following examples, assume that
.Cm @cwd
is set to
.Pa /usr/local
and the last extracted file was
.Pa bin/emacs .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm "\&%F"
Expands to the last filename extracted (as specified); in the example case,
.Pa bin/emacs .
.It Cm "\&%D"
Expands to the current directory prefix, as set with
.Cm @cwd ;
in the example case
.Pa /usr/local .
.It Cm "\&%B"
Expands to the
.Dq basename
of the fully qualified filename, that
is the current directory prefix, plus the last filespec, minus
the trailing filename.
In the example case, that would be
.Pa /usr/local/bin .
.It Cm "\&%f"
Expands to the
.Dq filename
part of the fully qualified name, or
the converse of
.Cm \&%B ;
in the example case,
.Pa emacs .
.El
.It Cm @unexec Ar command
Execute
.Ar command
as part of the deinstallation process.
Expansion of special
.Cm \&%
sequences is the same as for
.Cm @exec .
This command is not executed during the package add, as
.Cm @exec
is, but rather when the package is deleted.
This is useful
for deleting links and other ancillary files that were created
as a result of adding the package, but not directly known to
the package's table of contents (and hence not automatically
removable).
The advantage of using
.Cm @unexec
over a deinstallation script is that you can use the
.Dq special sequence expansion
to get at files regardless of where they've
been potentially redirected (see
.Fl p ) .
.It Cm @mode Ar mode
Set default permission for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar mode .
Format is the same as that used by the
.Cm chmod
command (well, considering that it's later handed off to it, that's
no surprise).
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction) permissions.
.It Cm @owner Ar user
Set default ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar user .
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
ownership.
.It Cm @group Ar group
Set default group ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar group .
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
group ownership.
.It Cm @comment Ar string
Imbed a comment in the packing list.
Useful in trying to document some particularly hairy sequence that
may trip someone up later.
.It Cm @ignore
Used internally to tell extraction to ignore the next file (don't
copy it anywhere), as it's used for some special purpose.
.It Cm @name Ar name
Set the name of the package.
This is mandatory and is usually put at the top.
This name is potentially different than the name of
the file it came in, and is used when keeping track of the package
for later deinstallation.
Note that
.Nm
will derive this field from the package name and add it automatically
if none is given.
.It Cm @dirrm Ar name
Declare directory
.Pa name
to be deleted at deinstall time.
By default, directories created by a
package installation are not deleted when the package is deinstalled;
this provides an explicit directory cleanup method.
This directive should appear at the end of the package list.
If more than one
.Cm @dirrm
directive is used, the directories are removed in the order specified.
The
.Pa name
directory will not be removed unless it is empty.
.It Cm @extra Ar file
Declare extra file
.Pa file
to be deleted at deinstall time, if user sets
.Fl c
option.
Those files are extra configuration files that are normally not deleted.
If
.Pa file
ends with a slash, it is a directory.
.It Cm @extraunexec Ar command
Extra
.Ar command
to execute when removing extra files.
.It Cm @display Ar name
Declare
.Pa name
as the file to be displayed at install time (see
.Fl D
above).
.It Cm @pkgdep Ar pkgname
Declare a dependency on the
.Ar pkgname
package.
The
.Ar pkgname
package must be installed before this package may be
installed, and this package must be deinstalled before the
.Ar pkgname
package is deinstalled.
Multiple
.Cm @pkgdep
directives may be used if the package depends on multiple other packages.
.It Cm @pkgcfl Ar pkgcflname
Declare a conflict to the
.Ar pkgcflname
package.
The
.Ar pkgcflname
package must
.Em not
be installed if
.Ar pkgname
package gets installed because they install the same files and thus conflict.
.Ar pkgcflname
may use
.Xr fnmatch 3
wildcards.
.It Cm @option Ar name
Effects vary depending on
.Ar name .
Some options are not documented yet.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar no-default-conflict
By default, a package conflicts with other versions of the same package.
With this option, the older package version will still be noticed, but the
installation will proceed anyway.
