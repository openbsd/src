.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command creates a binary package named
.Ar pkg-name ,
for subsequent use with
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_delete 1
and
.Xr pkg_info 1 .
.Ar pkg-name
will traditionally have a
.Pa .tgz
extension, to denote the underlying binary format.
.Pp
Use of the
.Xr ports 7
infrastructure instead of manual
.Nm
invocation is strongly recommended.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A Ar arches
Register a list of architectures for which this package should install.
.Ar arches
is a comma-separated list of architectures.
Use
.Sq *
to mean any architecture (e.g., arch-independent packages).
.It Fl f Ar packinglist
Fetch
.Dq packing list
for package from the file
.Ar packinglist .
Several packing-lists can be mentioned, in which case they will be 
concatenated together.
.It Fl c [ Ar \&- ] Ns Ar desc
Fetch package
.Dq one line description
from file
.Ar desc
or, if preceded by
.Dq \&- ,
the argument itself.
This string should also
give some idea of which version of the product (if any) the package
represents.
.It Fl d [ Ar \&- ] Ns Ar desc
Fetch long description for package from file
.Ar desc
or, if preceded by
.Dq \&- ,
the argument itself.
.It Fl D Ar name=value
Define name to value, for substitution and fragment inclusion purpose.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl h
Force
.Xr tar 1
to follow symbolic links, so that the files they point to
are dumped, rather than the links themselves (deprecated).
.It Fl i Ar iscript
Set
.Ar iscript
to be the install procedure for the package.
This can be any executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically
when the package is later installed.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Set
.Ar prefix
as the initial directory
.Dq base
to start from in selecting files for
the package, and to record as the base for installing the package.
.It Fl S Ar pkg-destdir
.It Fl B Ar pkg-destdir
Set
.Ar pkg-destdir
as the prefix to prepend to any file to select for the package.
Prefer
.Fl B .
.It Fl L Ar localbase
Record
.Ar localbase
as the localbase used in the package.
By default,
.Pa /usr/local .
Packages built with another localbase can only be installed by using
the same localbase in
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
to prevent errors.
.It Fl k Ar dscript
Set
.Ar dscript
to be the de-install procedure for the package.
This can be any executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically
when the package is later (if ever) de-installed.
.It Fl r Ar rscript
Set
.Ar rscript
to be the
.Dq requirements
procedure for the package.
This can be any executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically
at installation/deinstallation time to determine whether or not
installation/deinstallation should proceed.
.It Fl M Ar displayfile
Display the file (using
.Xr more 1 )
after installing the package.
Useful for things like
legal notices on almost-free software, etc.
.It Fl U Ar undisplayfile
Display the file (using
.Xr more 1 )
when deinstalling the package.
Useful for reminders about stuff to clean up.
.El
.Sh PACKING LIST DETAILS
The
.Dq packing list
format (see
.Fl f )
is fairly simple, being basically a list of filenames and directory names
to include in the package.
.Pp
Substitution of variables and inclusion of fragments is documented in the
next section.
.Pp
Directory names are denoted by a trailing slash.
.Pp
There are a few annotations that can be inserted for better control.
All these commands start with an 
.Sq @ .
Here is a list:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm @file Ar filename
Default annotation, to use if
.Ar filename
begins with @.
.Ar filename
is always a relative path, relative to the current
.Cm @cwd .
.It Cm @man Ar filename
Specialized version of
.Cm @file ,
to handle manual pages.
.It Cm @info Ar filename
Specialized version of
.Cm @file ,
to handle GNU info files.
Automatically grab
.Pa filename-*
chapter files, run
.Xr install-info 1
as needed.
.It Cm @lib Ar filename
Specialized version of
.Cm @file ,
to handle shared libraries.
Satisfy LIB_DEPENDS,
run
.Xr ldconfig 8
as needed.
.It Cm @shell Ar filename
Specialized version of
.Cm @file , 
to handle shells.
See
.Xr shells 5 .
.It Cm @newuser Ar name:uid:group:loginclass:comment:home:shell
During
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
create a new user, happens before any file creation.
All fields correspond to
.Xr useradd 8
parameters.
Some fields are optional and can be left empty.
If the user already exists, no action is taken.
Individual fields can be prefixed by a ! to make sure an existing
user matches.
For instance, the directive
.Li @newuser foo:!42
will make sure user foo has uid 42.
During
.Xr pkg_delete 1 ,
users will be deleted if extra clean-up has been requested, and if
other installed packages don't list the same user.
.It Cm @newgroup Ar name:gid
During
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
create a new group, using
.Xr groupadd 8 .
Happens before file and user creations.
.Ar gid
can be prefixed with a ! to ensure group has the correct gid.
During
.Xr pkg_delete 1 ,
groups will be deleted if extra clean-up has been requested, and if
other installed packages don't list the same group.
.It Cm @arch Ar arches
List of architectures for which this package is intended.
.It Cm @cwd Ar pathname
Set the package current directory.
All subsequent filenames will be assumed relative to 
.Ar pathname .
.It Cm @exec Ar command
Execute
.Ar command
during
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
If
.Ar command
contains any of the following sequences somewhere in it, they will
be expanded inline.
For the following examples, assume that
.Cm @cwd
is set to
.Pa /usr/local
and the last extracted file was
.Pa bin/emacs .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm "\&%F"
Expands to the last filename extracted (as specified); in the example case,
.Pa bin/emacs .
.It Cm "\&%D"
Expands to the current directory prefix, as set with
.Cm @cwd ;
in the example case
.Pa /usr/local .
.It Cm "\&%B"
Expands to the
.Dq basename
of the fully qualified filename, that
is the current directory prefix, plus the last filespec, minus
the trailing filename.
In the example case, that would be
.Pa /usr/local/bin .
.It Cm "\&%f"
Expands to the
.Dq filename
part of the fully qualified name, or
the converse of
.Cm \&%B ;
in the example case,
.Pa emacs .
.El
.It Cm @unexec Ar command
Execute
.Ar command
during
.Xr pkg_delete 1 .
Expansion of special
.Cm \&%
sequences is the same as for
.Cm @exec .
.It Cm @mode Ar mode
Set default permission for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar mode .
Format is the same as that used by the
.Xr chmod 1
command.
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction) permissions.
.It Cm @owner Ar user
Set default ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar user .
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
ownership.
.It Cm @group Ar group
Set default group ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar group .
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
group ownership.
.It Cm @comment Ar string
Imbed a comment in the packing list.
Useful in trying to document some particularly hairy sequence that
may trip someone up later.
Can also be used to comment out elements that update-plist
.Po
see
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5
.Pc
will insist in inserting in a packing-list.
.It Cm @ignore
Used internally to tell extraction to ignore the next file (don't
copy it anywhere), as it's used for some special purpose.
.It Cm @localbase Ar base
Used internally to record the settings of
.Fl L
option.
.It Cm @name Ar pkgname
Set the name of the package.
This name is potentially different than the name of
the file it came in, and is used when keeping track of the package
for later deinstallation.
Note that
.Nm
will derive this field from the package name and add it automatically
if none is given.
.It Cm @dir Ar directoryname
Create directory 
.Pa directoryname 
at 
.Xr pkg_add 1
time, taking 
.Cm @mode ,
.Cm @group ,
.Cm @owner
into account, and remove it during
.Xr pkg_delete 1 .
Directories to remove can be shared between packages.
If
.Ar name
does not begin with an @, same as
.Dl name/
.It Cm @dirrm Ar directoryname
Declare directory
.Pa directoryname
to be deleted at deinstall time.
Deprecated, use
.Dl directoryname/
instead, as it handles proper directory creation as well.
.It Cm @mandir Ar directoryname
Specialized version of
.Cm @dir ,
to handle manual directories: instruct user to add/remove the
directory to 
.Xr man.conf 5 ,
remove
.Xr apropos 1
database when needed.
.It Cm @fontdir Ar directoryname
Specialized version of
.Cm @dir ,
to handle font directories: create
.Pa font.alias
from
.Pa font.alias-*
fragments, execute
.Xr mkfontdir 1 ,
.Xr fc-cache 1
when needed.
Delete extra files at
.Xr pkg_delete 1
time.
.It Cm @extra Ar filename
Declare extra file
.Pa filename
to be deleted at deinstall time, if user sets
.Fl c
option.
Those files are extra configuration files that are normally not deleted.
.Ar filename
can be an absolute path.
If
.Pa filename
ends with a slash, it is a directory.
.It Cm @extraunexec Ar command
Extra
.Ar command
to execute when removing extra files.
.It Cm @sample Ar filename
Last preceding
.Cm @file
item is a sample configuration file, to be copied to
.Ar filename
at
.Xr pkg_add 1
time and to be removed at
.Xr pkg_delete 1
time.
During installation, existing configuration files are untouched.
During deinstallation, configuration files are only removed if unchanged.
.Ar filename
can be an absolute path.
If
.Ar filename
ends with a slash,
it refers to a configuration directory instead.
.It Cm @conflict Ar pkgspec
Declare a conflict with packages matching
.Ar pkgspec
.Po
See
.Xr packages-specs 7 
.Pc .
The
.Ar pkgname
package can
.Em not
be installed if a package
matching
.Ar pkgspec
has been installed because they install the same files and thus conflict.
.It Cm @display Ar name
Declare
.Pa name
as the file to be displayed at install time (see
.Fl M
above).
.It Cm @pkgdep Ar pkgname
Declare a dependency on the
.Ar pkgname
package.
The
.Ar pkgname
package must be installed before this package may be
installed, and this package must be deinstalled before the
.Ar pkgname
package is deinstalled.
Multiple
.Cm @pkgdep
directives may be used if the package depends on multiple other packages.
.It Cm @pkgcfl Ar pkgcflname
Declare a conflict to the
.Ar pkgcflname
package.
The
.Ar pkgcflname
package must
.Em not
be installed if
.Ar pkgname
package gets installed because they install the same files and thus conflict.
.Ar pkgcflname
may use
.Xr fnmatch 3
wildcards.
Deprecated, use
.Cm @conflict
instead.
.It Cm @option Ar name
Effects vary depending on
.Ar name .
Some options are not documented yet.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar no-default-conflict
By default, a package conflicts with other versions of the same package.
With this option, the older package version will still be noticed, but the
installation will proceed anyway.
