.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg.conf
.Nd system-wide package system configuration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/pkg.conf
contains system-wide options related to package handling, as a list of
.Sq keyword=value
lines.
.Pp
In particular, the base system
.Dq installation-and-update
shell scripts record the URL used for the installation as
.Ar installpath .
.Xr pkg_add 1
can then add or replace packages from the same location straight after
the install.
.Pp
Currently defined options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width fullkeyword -compact
.It Ar fullwidth
Set to
.Ar yes
if you really want to use the full width of the terminal for the progressmeter.
.It Ar loglevel
.Xr pkg_add 1
and
.Xr pkg_delete 1
will
.Xr syslog 3
installations, updates and deletions by default.
Set to
.Ar 0
to avoid logging entirely.
Levels higher than
.Ar 1
may log more information in the future.
.It Ar installpath
URL to package repository updated during installation.
Used for accessing packages if the environment variable
.Ev PKG_PATH
is not defined and no further options are defined.
.It Ar nochecksum
Set to
.Ar yes
to waive MD5 checksums during package deletions.
.It Ar ntogo
Set to
.Ar yes
to display (done/total) number of package messages.
.El
.Pp
Each option uses a separate line, and follows the following template:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
keyword = value
.Ed
.Pp
A list of values can also be specified over several lines using the variation:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
keyword += value
keyword += value
\&...
.Ed
.Pp
Keywords are case-insensitive.
.Pp
Blank lines and comment lines (introduced by a #) are ignored.
.Pp
Unknown keywords are ignored.
