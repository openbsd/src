.Sh NAME

.Nd sign binary packages for distribution
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_sign

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to sign existing collections of binary packages
created by
.Xr pkg_create 1 .
.Pp
It will sign the packages and optionally, produce a
.Pa SHA256
manifest file in the output directory.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Append
.Xr sha256 1
checksums to
.Pa SHA256
in the output directory, then sort it.
.\" .It Fl D Ar resign
.\" Allows signing over already signed packages.
.\" Obviously, this checks the existing signature first,
.\" so the
.\" .Fl D Ar SIGNER
.\" and
.\" .Fl D Ar nosig
.\" also apply with the same semantics as
.\" .Xr pkg_add 1 .
.It Fl i
Incremental mode.
Ignore packages that are already in the output repository.
Note that, in verbose mode, they will still show up as
.Sq Signed
in the listing.
.It Fl j Ar maxjobs
Sign existing packages in parallel.
.It Fl o Ar dir
Specify output directory for signing packages.
Otherwise, unsigned packages are created in the current directory.
.It Fl S Ar source
Source repository for packages to be signed.
.\" This can be any url admissible for a
.\" .Ev PKG_PATH ,
.\" so that it is possible to sign packages during a transfer, e.g.,
.\" .Bd -literal -offset indent
.\" pkg_sign -s signify -s mykey-pkg.sec \e
.\" 	-o output -S scp://build-machine/packages/
.\" .Ed
.It Xo
.Fl s Cm signify2
.Fl s Ar privkey
.Xc
Specify signature parameters for signed packages.
Option parameters are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width signify2
.It Cm signify2
Choose
.Xr signify 1
new style signatures, where the
.Xr gzip 1
compressed data is signed.
.It Ar privkey
The path to the signer's private key.
For
.Cm signify ,
the private key name is used to set the
.Cm @signer
annotation.
If a corresponding public key is found, the first signatures will be
checked for key mismatches.
.El
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output, display
.Sq Signed output/pkg.tgz
after each package is signed.
.El
.Sh SIGNATURE DETAILS
The signature is stored within the
.Xr gzip 1
comment, as plain text data, according to
.Xr signify 1
.Fl zS
mode.
It contains the ed25519 signature, some meta-information,
and
SHA512/256 checksums for each 64K block of compressed data.
.Pp
Additionally, for further manual checking, the packing-list contains
a complete manifest of files within the package,
checksummed with
.Xr sha256 1
and annotated with proper
.Cm @mode ,
.Cm @user ,
.Cm @group
annotations, so that
.Xr pkg_add 1
will refuse to give special rights to any file which isn't properly annotated,
and so that it will abort on installation of a file whose checksum does not
match.
.Pp
Meta-information from
.Xr signify 1
gets inserted in the packing list during extraction,
adding a
.Cm @digital-signature
annotation and a
.Cm @signer
annotation for further manual inspection.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Ox 5.5 .
The signature process was completely redesigned for
.Ox 6.1 .
