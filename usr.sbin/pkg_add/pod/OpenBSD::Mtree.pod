=head1 NAME

OpenBSD::Mtree - simple C<mtree(8)> spec parser

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OpenBSD::Mtree;

    my %hier;

    OpenBSD::Mtree::parse(\%hier, "/", "/etc/mtree/4.4BSD.dist");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<OpenBSD::Mtree> is a parser for C<mtree(8)> specifications that
can reconstruct directory hierarchies.

The basic function C<OpenBSD::Mtree::parse_fh(\%hash, $basedir, $fh)>
will populate the hash C<$hash> with defined entries for each directory
seen while reading from C<$fh>, assuming the specification is to be interpreted
relative to C<$basedir> (some canonicalization of directory names will
occur).

C<OpenBSD::Mtree:parse(\%hash, $basedir, $filename)> is a convenience
function which also handles opening the filehandle from C<$filename>
and closing it after reading the specification.
