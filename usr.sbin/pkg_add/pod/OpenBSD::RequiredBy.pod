OpenBSD::RequiredBy - manage installed package dependencies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OpenBSD::RequiredBy;

	
    # let's do things for real
    our $not = 0;

    my $o = OpenBSD::RequiredBy->new($pkgname);

    my $o2 = OpenBSD::Requiring->new($pkgname);

    print "Requirements for $pkgname are ", join(' ',$o2->list()), "\n";

    # add some reverse dependencies
    $o->add($reverse_dep1, $reverse_dep2);

    # remove some dependency
    $o2->delete($dep);

    # forget some cache entry
    OpenBSD::RequiredBy->forget(installed_info($pkgname));


=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for comment should add a reference to L<PackageInfo/installed_info>
when it's documented.

C<OpenBSD::RequiredBy> handles lists of forward and reverse dependencies
for installed packages.

If C<$main::not> is true, all change operations are done internally and
never written to disk.

C<$o = OpenBSD::RequiredBy-E<gt>new($pkgname)> gives access to the reverse 
dependencies,
C<$o =OpenBSD::Requiring-E<gt>new($pkgname)>  gives access to the forward 
dependencies.

Such an object can be used to list the dependencies C<$o-E<gt>list()>,
add names to them C<$o-E<gt>add(name1, name2,...)> or remove name from
them C<$o-E<gt>delete(name1, name2, ...)>.

Those lists of dependencies trim duplicates and, unless C<$main::not> is true,
disk files are automatically synchronized whenever the lists change.

C<OpenBSD::RequiredBy> maintains a cache for efficiency. When an 
installed package is deleted completely, 
C<OpenBSD::RequiredBy-E<gt>forget($dir)> and 
C<OpenBSD::Requiring-E<gt>forget($dir)> will remove the cache entries.
