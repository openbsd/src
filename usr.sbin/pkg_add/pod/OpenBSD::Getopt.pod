=head1 NAME

OpenBSD::Getopt - Process single-characters switches

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use OpenBSD::Getopt;

   our($opt_o, $opt_i, $opt_f, $opt_v);
   getopts('oifv:',
    	{ 'v' => sub {
		++$opt_v;}
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is similar to L<getopt(3)>. One call to C<getopts($optstring)> parses
all the options using the C<$optstring> as a list of simple switches
(letter) and switches with arguments (letter followed by C<:>).

Option values are directly written into local variables of the form
C<$opt_S>, where C<S> is the switch name.

Contrary to L<getopt(3)>, C<$opt_S> is incremented each time the switch is
seen, to allow for stuff like C<-vv>.

An optional hash can be used as a second argument, with switches as keys
and subs as values. When a switch is met, the sub C<$foo> is called as
C<$foo> for a simple switch and as C<$foo(option_value)> for a switch
with argument.
