.Dt PPPCTL 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pppctl
.Nd PPP control program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pppctl
.Bk -words
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl p Ar passwd
.Op Fl t Ar n
.Xo
.Oo Ar host : Oc Ar port No \&|
.Ar LocalSocket
.Xc
.Op Ar command Op ; Ns Ar command ...
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program provides command line control of the
.Xr ppp 8
daemon.
Its primary use is to facilitate simple scripts that
control a running daemon.
.Pp
.Nm
is passed at least one argument, specifying the socket on which
.Xr ppp 8
is listening.
Refer to the
.Ic set server
command of
.Xr ppp 8
for details.
If the socket contains a leading
.Sq / ,
it is taken as an
.Dv AF_LOCAL
socket.
If it contains a colon, it is treated as a
.Ar host : Ns Ar port
pair, otherwise it is treated as a TCP port specification on the
local machine (127.0.0.1).
Both the
.Ar host
and
.Ar port
may be specified numerically if you wish to avoid a DNS lookup
or don't have an entry for the given port in
.Pa /etc/services .
.Pp
All remaining arguments are concatenated to form the command(s)
that will be sent to the
.Xr ppp 8
daemon.
If any semi-colon characters are found, they are treated as
.Ar command
delimiters, allowing more than one
.Ar command
in a given
.Dq session .
For example (adding a route):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pppctl 3000 add 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 127.0.0.1\e; show route
.Ed
.Pp
Don't forget to escape or quote the
.Sq \&;
as it is a special character for most shells.
.Pp
If no
.Ar command
arguments are given,
.Nm
enters interactive mode, where commands are read from standard input.
When reading commands, the
.Xr editline 3
library is used, allowing command-line editing (with
.Xr editrc 5
defining editing behaviour).
The history size defaults to 20 lines.
.Pp
The following command line options are available:
.Bl -tag -width "-p passwd  "
.It Fl p Ar passwd
Specify the password required by the
.Xr ppp 8
daemon.
If this switch is not used,
.Nm
will prompt for a password once it has successfully connected to
.Xr ppp 8 .
.It Fl t Ar n
Use a timeout of
.Ar n
instead of the default 2 seconds when connecting.
This may be required
if you wish to control a daemon over a slow (or even a dialup) link.
.It Fl v
Display all data sent to and received from the
.Xr ppp 8
daemon.
Normally,
.Nm
displays only non-prompt lines received.
This option is ignored in interactive mode.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables are understood by
.Nm
when in interactive mode:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXX
.It Ev EL_SIZE
The number of history lines.
The default is 20.
.It Ev EL_EDITOR
The edit mode.
Only values of
.Dq emacs
and
.Dq vi
are accepted.
Other values are silently ignored.
This environment variable will override the
.Dq bind -v
and
.Dq bind -e
commands in
.Pa ~/.editrc .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
If you run
.Xr ppp 8
in
.Fl auto
mode,
.Nm
can be used to automate many frequent tasks (you can actually control
.Xr ppp 8
in any mode except interactive mode).
Use of the
.Fl p
option is discouraged (even in scripts that aren't readable by others)
as a
.Xr ps 1
listing may reveal your secret.
.Pp
The best way to allow easy, secure
.Nm
access is to create a local server socket in
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.conf
(in the correct section) like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set server /var/run/internet "" 0177
.Ed
.Pp
This will instruct
.Xr ppp
to create a local domain socket, with srw------- permissions and no
password, allowing access only to the user that invoked
.Xr ppp .
Refer to the
.Xr ppp 8
man page for further details.
.Pp
You can now create some easy-access scripts.
To connect to the Internet:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /bin/sh
test $# -eq 0 && time=300 || time=$1
exec pppctl /var/run/internet set timeout $time\\; dial
.Ed
.Pp
To disconnect:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /bin/sh
exec pppctl /var/run/internet set timeout 300\\; close
.Ed
.Pp
To check if the line is up:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /bin/sh
pppctl -p '' -v /var/run/internet quit | grep ^PPP >/dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo Link is up
else
  echo Link is down
fi
.Ed
.Pp
You can even make a generic script:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /bin/sh
exec pppctl /var/run/internet "$@"
.Ed
