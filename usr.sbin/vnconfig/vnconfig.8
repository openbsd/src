.Sh NAME
.Nm vnconfig
.Nd "configure vnode disks for file swapping or pseudo file systems"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vnconfig Fl c
.Op Fl v
.Ar rawdev
.Ar regular_file
.Nm vnconfig Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Ar rawdev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures vnode pseudo disk devices.
It will associate the special file
.Ar rawdev
with the regular file
.Ar regular_file
allowing the latter to be accessed as though it were a disk.
Hence a regular file within the filesystem can be used for swapping
or can contain a filesystem that is mounted in the name space.
Both traditional devices,
.Pa vnd ,
and the cache-coherent devices,
.Pa svnd ,
are configured through
.Nm vnconfig .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Configures the device.
If successful, references to
.Ar rawdev
will access the contents of
.Ar regular_file .
.It Fl u
Unconfigures the device.
.It Fl v
Print messages to stdout describing actions taken.
.El
.Pp
If no action option is given,
.Fl c
is assumed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/rvnd?? -compact
.It Pa /dev/{,r}{,s}vnd*
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configure the vnode disk
.Pa svnd0
(all of its partitions become usable):
.Pp
.Dl vnconfig svnd0 /tmp/diskimage
.Pp
Unconfigure the same device:
.Pp
.Dl vnconfig -u svnd0
.Sh BUGS
This command should really be named
.Nm vndconfig .
