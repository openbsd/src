.Sh NAME
.Nm vnconfig
.Nd "configure vnode disks for file swapping or pseudo file systems"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl vk
.Ar rawdev
.Ar regular_file
.Nm
.Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Ar rawdev
.Nm
.Fl l
.Op Ar rawdev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures vnode pseudo disk devices.
It will associate (or disassociate) the special file
.Ar rawdev
with the regular file
.Ar regular_file
allowing the latter to be accessed as though it were a disk.
Hence a regular file within the file system can be used for swapping
or can contain a file system that is mounted in the name space.
Both traditional devices,
.Pa vnd ,
and the cache-coherent devices,
.Pa svnd ,
are configured through
.Nm vnconfig .
.Pp
If you read the regular file while using
.Pa svnd ,
you need to mount the
.Pa svnd
with the mount option
.Ar sync
to ensure consistency in the buffer cache.
For normal operation this is not necessary.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Configures the device.
If successful, references to
.Ar rawdev
will access the contents of
.Ar regular_file .
This is the default operation.
.It Fl k
Associate an encryption key with the device.
All data will be encrypted using the Blowfish cipher before it is
written to the disk.
Encryption only works with
.Pa svnd .
.It Fl l
List the vnd devices and indicate which ones are in use.
If a specific
.Ar rawdev
is given, then only that one will be described.
.It Fl u
Unconfigures the device.
.It Fl v
Print messages to stdout describing actions taken.
.El
.Pp
If no action option is given,
.Fl c
is assumed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/rvnd?? -compact
.It Pa /dev/{,r}{,s}vnd*
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configure a CD-ROM or DVD image file as vnode disk svnd0
and mount the ISO 9660 file system contained in it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# vnconfig svnd0 /tmp/diskimage
# mount -t cd9660 /dev/svnd0c /mnt
.Ed
.Pp
Unmount the file system and unconfigure the vnode device:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# umount /mnt
# vnconfig -u svnd0
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vnd 4 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr swapon 8 ,
.Xr umount 8
.Sh BUGS
This command should really be named
.Nm vndconfig .
