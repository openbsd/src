.Nd create a file system image from a directory tree
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl f Ar free-files
.Op Fl M Ar minimum-size
.Op Fl m Ar maximum-size

.Op Fl t Ar fs-type
.Ar image-file

.Op Ar extra-directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The utility
.Nm
creates a file system image into
.Ar image-file
from the directory tree
.Ar directory .
If any optional directory trees are passed in the
.Ar extra-directory
arguments, then the directory tree of each argument will be merged
into the
.Ar directory
first before creating
.Ar image-file .
No special devices or privileges are required to perform this task.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl B Ar endian
Set the byte order of the image to
.Ar endian .
Valid byte orders are
.Ql 4321 ,
.Ql big ,
or
.Ql be
for big endian, and
.Ql 1234 ,
.Ql little ,
or
.Ql le
for little endian.
Some file systems may have a fixed byte order; in those cases this
argument will be ignored.
.It Fl b Ar free-blocks
Ensure that a minimum of
.Ar free-blocks
free blocks exist in the image.
An optional
.Ql %
suffix may be provided to indicate that
.Ar free-blocks
indicates a percentage of the calculated image size.
.It Fl d Ar debug-mask
Enable various levels of debugging, depending upon which bits are
set in
.Ar debug-mask .
XXX: document these
.It Fl f Ar free-files
Ensure that a minimum of
.Ar free-files
free files (inodes) exist in the image.
An optional
.Ql %
suffix may be provided to indicate that
.Ar free-files
indicates a percentage of the calculated image size.
.It Fl M Ar minimum-size
Set the minimum size of the file system image to
.Ar minimum-size .
.It Fl m Ar maximum-size
Set the maximum size of the file system image to
.Ar maximum-size .
An error will be raised if the target file system needs to be larger
than this to accommodate the provided directory tree.
.It Fl O Ar offset
Instead of creating the file system at the beginning of the file, start
at offset.
Valid only for
.Sy ffs
and
.Sy msdos .
.It Fl o Ar fs-options
Set file system specific options.
.Ar fs-options
is a comma separated list of options.
Valid file system specific options are detailed below.
.It Fl r
When merging multiple directories replace duplicate files with the last found.
.It Fl S Ar sector-size
Set the file system sector size to
.Ar sector-size .
.\" XXX: next line also true for cd9660?
Defaults to 512.
.It Fl s Ar image-size
Set the size of the file system image to
.Ar image-size .
.It Fl T Ar timestamp
Specify a timestamp to be set for all file system files and directories
created so that repeatable builds are possible.
The
.Ar timestamp
can be a
.Pa pathname ,
where the timestamps are derived from that file, a parseable date
for
.Xr parsedate 3
(this option is not yet available in the tools build), or an integer
value interpreted as the number of seconds from the Epoch.
.It Fl t Ar fs-type
Create an
.Ar fs-type
file system image.
The following file system types are supported:
.Bl -tag -width cd9660 -offset indent
.It Sy ffs
BSD fast file system (default).
.It Sy cd9660
ISO 9660 file system.
.It Sy msdos
FAT12, FAT16, or FAT32 file system.
.El
.It Fl Z
Create a sparse file for
.Sy ffs .
This is useful for virtual machine images.
.El
.Pp
Where sizes are specified, a decimal number of bytes is expected.
Two or more numbers may be separated by an
.Dq x
to indicate a product.
Each number may have one of the following optional suffixes:
.Bl -tag -width 3n -offset indent -compact
.It b
Block; multiply by 512
.It k
Kibi; multiply by 1024 (1 KiB)
.It m
Mebi; multiply by 1048576 (1 MiB)
.It g
Gibi; multiply by 1073741824 (1 GiB)
.It t
Tebi; multiply by 1099511627776 (1 TiB)
.It w
Word; multiply by the number of bytes in an integer
.El
.\"

.Ss FFS-specific options

.El
.Ss CD9660-specific options
.Sy cd9660
images have ISO9660-specific optional parameters that may be
provided.
The arguments consist of a keyword and, optionally, an equal sign
.Pq Ql = ,
and a value.
The following keywords are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width omit-trailing-period -offset indent -compact
