.Nm hoststated
.Nd Host Status daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Oo Xo
.Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value Oc
.Xc
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a host status daemon for server load-balancing.
It monitors groups of hosts for availability,
which is determined by checking for a specific service
common to a host group.
When availability is confirmed, Layer 3 and/or Layer 7
load-balancing services are set up by
.Nm .
.Pp
Layer 3 load-balancing happens at the packet level; to configure
it,
.Nm
communicates with
.Xr pf 4 .
To allow
.Nm
to properly set up
.Xr pf 4
rules, the following line is required in the NAT section of
.Xr pf.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rdr-anchor "hoststated/*"
.Ed
.Pp
Layer 7 load-balancing happens at the application level and is
handled by
.Nm
itself.
.Pp
.Nm
works in terms of the following
.Em entities :
relays, protocols, services, and tables.
A
.Em relay
represents a Layer 7 load-balancing instance.
Each instance translates to a listening TCP or UDP port.
A
.Em protocol
defines which actions, if any, must be taken on the
packet payload as data crosses a relay.
A
.Em service
represents a Layer 3 load-balancing instance.
Each instance translates to a
.Xr pf 4
rdr rule being added.
A
.Em table
represents a group of hosts which can be checked for
availability using the same method.
Each table contains at least one host.
If a table is used in a Layer 3 load-balancing instance, it
will be mapped to a
.Xr pf 4
table containing only hosts which are up.
.Pp
All these entities can be configured in
.Xr hoststated.conf 5
and
.Xr hoststatectl 8
can be used to alter or report the status of each entity.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/hoststated.conf .
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/run/hoststated.sockXX" -compact
.It /etc/hoststated.conf

.It /var/run/hoststated.sock
