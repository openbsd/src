.TH fs1toppm 1 "21 February 1994"
.SH NAME
fs1toppm - convert the output from the Ricoh FS1 scanner to PPM format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fs1toppm
.I <width in pixels> <height in pixels>
.I <FS1 file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I fs1toppm
reads the width and height in pixels of the scanner image
data as a decimal integer from the command line and the scanner image
data from the file specified on the command line.
It writes the data out in a format compatible with Portable Pix Map
(PPM) "rawbits".
.PP
This program was written because the color data format used by
the Ricoh FS1 scanner and Portable Pix Map (PPM) are incompatible.
In PPM the red, green and blue samples are interleaved at the pixel level;
the Ricoh FS1 interleaves them at the row level.
.PP
The
.I grabscan
script uses
.I fs1toppm
internally.
.SH EXAMPLES
