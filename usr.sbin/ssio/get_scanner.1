.SH NAME
get_scanner - view the current parameter settings for the scanner
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B get_scanner
.RI [ -p ][ -q ][ -l <logical-name-of-scanner-to-use>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Produces a list of scanner attributes and their values.  The -p flag
makes get_scanner print only the pixel size of the image.  The
optional -q flag formats the list to match the command line for the
set_scanner program.  This is useful for saving and restoring settings
inside of scripts.  The -l flag is used if you have two or more
scanners.  The default logical name is "scan0".

get_scanner -l scan1

old_values=`get_scanner -q`
