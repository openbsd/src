.SH NAME
use_adf - set up the scanner for reading a page from the ADF
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B use_adf
.RI [ -l <logical-name-of-scanner-to-use>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
When you run this program on a scanner with paper in the Automatic
Document Feeder (ADF), the next time you do a read the ADF will be the
paper source.  This program will also eject paper sitting in the ADF.
.SH NOTE
The Ricoh scanner must have the "use_adf" attribute set to "yes" in
order to work the ADF.  This is not true for the Fujitsu.
