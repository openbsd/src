.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
.B Zonec
is the nsd(8) database compiler for creating name space databases 
from a set of input master zone files specified in nsd.conf(5) file. 
.LP
It is normally invoked via nsdc(8) rebuild command. 
.B Zonec
will then parse every zone in nsd.conf(5) file and add it to the 
name space database,
.I @dbfile@
by default, that is used by nsd(8) to answer incoming queries.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-c\fI configfile
Read specified configfile instead of the default 
.IR @nsdconfigfile@ .
.TP
.B \-C 
No config file is read (use with \-f, \-o and \-z).
.TP
.B \-d\fI directory
Change the working directory to
.I directory
before doing any work. Overrides zonesdir: option in config file.
.TP
.B \-f\fI database
Create the specified
.I database
instead of the file specified as database: in the config file.
.TP
.B \-o\fI origin
Use this as the first origin. Zone information is read from 
zonefile specified with \-z. When reading zones from config file 
this option is ignored.
.TP
.B \-z\fI zonefile
Reads all zone information from
.IR zonefile .
If 
.IR zonefile
equals `\-`, then all zone information is read from stdin, making 
constructs like:
.LP
.RS
.B # cat zones* 
| 
.B ./nsd\-zonec \-C \-f nsd.db \-o example.net \-z \-
.RE

possible. When reading zones from config file this option is 
ignored.
.RE
.TP
.B \-v
Increase the verbosity of nsd\-zonec. This flag can be specified multiple 
times to increase the level of verbosity. The first level of
verbosity will print per zone summary information. The second level 
of will print progress information for each 10,000 RRs processed.
.TP
.B \-F
Set debug facilities. (If compiled with \-\-enable\-checking.)
.TP
.B \-L
Set debug level. (If compiled with \-\-enable\-checking.)

expects the input files to be free of syntax errors and very little
fool proof checks are done.
