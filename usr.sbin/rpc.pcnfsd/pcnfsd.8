.SH NAME
pcnfsd \- (PC)NFS authentication and print request server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/sbin/rpc.pcnfsd
.SH WARNING
This program probably contains 5 to 6 security holes in it (it has been
diagnosed to have a few, but they were not yet been fixed).  Use it at
your own risk.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B pcnfsd
is an
.SM RPC
server that supports Sun ONC clients on PC (DOS, OS/2, Macintosh, and other)
systems. This page describes version two of the
.B pcnfsd
server.
.LP
.B rpc.pcnfsd
may be started from
.B /etc/rc.local
or by the
.BR inetd (8)
superdaemon. It reads the configuration file
.B /etc/pcnfsd.conf
if present, and then services RPC requests directed to
program number 150001. This release of the
.B pcnfsd
daemon supports both version 1 and version 2 of the pcnfsd
protocol. Consult the
.B rpcgen
source file
.B pcnfsd.x
for details of the protocols.
.LP
The requests serviced by
.B pcnfsd
fall into three categories: authentication, printing, and other. Only the
authentication and printing services have administrative significance.
.SH AUTHENTICATION
When
.B pcnfsd
receives a
.B PCNFSD_AUTH
or
.B PCNFSD2_AUTH
request\**, it will "log in" the user by validating the username and
password and returning the corresponding uid, gids, home directory,
and umask. If
.B pcnfsd
was built with the
.B WTMP
compile-time option, it will also append a record to the
.BR wtmp (5)
database. If you do not wish to record PC "logins" in this way,
you should add a line of the form
.RS
.sp
\fBwtmp off\fP
.sp
.RE
to the
.B /etc/pcnfsd.conf
file.
.SH PRINTING
.LP
.B pcnfsd
supports a printing model based on the use of NFS to transfer
the actual print data from the client to the server. The client system
issues a
.B PCNFSD_PR_INIT
or
.B PCNFSD2_PR_INIT
request, and the server returns the path to a spool directory which
the client may use and which is exported by NFS.
.B pcnfsd
creates a subdirectory for each of its clients: the parent
directory is normally
.B /export/pcnfs
and the subdirectory is the hostname of the client system.
If you wish to use a different parent directory, you should add a
line of the form
.RS
.sp
\fBspooldir\fP \fIpath\fP
.sp
.RE
to the
.B /etc/pcnfsd.conf
file.
.LP
Once a client has mounted the spool directory using NFS
and has transferred print data to a file in this directory, it
will issue a
.B PCNFSD_PR_START
or
.B PCNFSD2_PR_START
request.
.B pcnfsd
handles this, and most other print-related requests, by
constructing a command based on the printing services of
the server operating system and executing the command using the
identity of the PC user. Since this involves set-user-ID privileges,
.B pcnfsd
must be run as root.
.LP
Every print request from the client includes the name of the printer
which is to be used. In SunOS, this name corresponds to a printer
definition in the
.BR /etc/printcap (5)
database. If you wish to define a non-standard way of processing
print data, you should define a new printer and arrange for the
client to print to this printer. There are two ways of setting up a new printer.
The first involves the addition of an entry to
.BR /etc/printcap (5)
and the creation of filters to perform the required processing. This
is outside the scope of this discussion. In addition,
.B pcnfsd
includes a mechanism by which  you can define virtual printers known
only to
.B pcnfsd
clients. Each printer is defined by a line in the
.B /etc/pcnfsd.conf
file of the following form
.RS
.sp
\fBprinter\fP \fIname alias-for command\fP
.sp
.RE
\fIname\fP is the name of the printer you want to define. \fIalias-for\fP
is the name of a "real" printer which corresponds to this printer. For
example, a request to
display the queue for \fIname\fP will be translated into the
corresponding request for the printer \fIalias-for\fP. If you have
defined a printer in such a way that there is no "real" printer to
which it corresponds, use a single "-" for this field. (See the
definition of the printer
.B test
below for an example.) \fIcommand\fP is a
command which will be executed whenever a file is printed on \fIname\fP.
This command is executed by the Bourne shell,
.B /bin/sh
using the
.B -c
option. For complex operations you should
construct an executable shell program and invoke that in \fIcommand\fP.
Within \fIcommand\fP the following tokens will be replaced:
.LP
.TP 10
.B Token
.B Substitution
.TP
.SB $FILE
Replaced by the full path name of the print data file. When
the command has been executed, the file will be unlinked.
.TP
.SB $USER
Replaced by the username of the user logged in to the client system.
.TP
.SB $HOST
Replaced by the host name of the client system.
.LP
Consider the following example
.B /etc/pcnfsd.conf
file:
.RS
.sp
printer rotated lw /usr/local/bin/enscript -2r \s-2$FILE\s0
.br
printer test - /usr/bin/cp \s-2$FILE\s0 /usr/tmp/\s-2$HOST\s0-\s-2$USER\s0
.sp
.RE
If a client system prints a job on the printer
.B rotated
the utility
.B enscript
will be invoked to pre-process the file \s-2$FILE\s0. In this
case, the
.B -2r
option causes the file to be printed in two-column rotated format
on the default PostScript\(rg printer.
If the client requests a list of the print queue for the printer
.B rotated
the
.B pcnfsd
daemon will translate this into a request for a listing for
the printer
.B lw.
.LP
The printer
.B test
is used only for testing. Any file sent to this printer
will be copied into
.B /usr/tmp.
Any request to list the queue, check the status, etc. of printer
.B test
will be rejected because the \fIalias-for\fP has been specified as "-".
