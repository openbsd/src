.Sh NAME
.Nm acme-client.conf
.Nd acme-client configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is divided into the following main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Authorities
Certificate authorities (CAs) that can be contacted via ACME.
.It Sy Domains
Certificate specifications.
.El
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/acme-client.sub.conf"
.Ed
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, underscore, or '/'
must be quoted.
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words.
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
api_url="https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
authority letsencrypt {
	api url $api_url
	account key "/etc/acme/letsencrypt-privkey.pem"
}

.It Ic domain key Ar file Op Ar keytype
The private key file for which the certificate will be obtained.
.Ar keytype
can be
.Cm rsa
or
.Cm ecdsa .
It defaults to
.Cm rsa .
.It Ic domain certificate Ar file
The filename of the certificate that will be issued.
This is optional if
.Ar domain full chain certificate
is specified.
.It Ic domain chain certificate Ar file
The filename in which to store the certificate chain

This setting is optional.
.It Ic domain full chain certificate Ar file
The filename in which to store the full certificate chain
that will be returned by the certificate authority.
It needs to be in the same directory as the

.Ar domain certificate
and the
.Ar domain chain certificate
in one file, and is required by most browsers.
This is optional if
.Ar domain certificate
is specified.
.It Ic sign with Ar authority
The certificate authority (as declared above in the
.Sx AUTHORITIES
