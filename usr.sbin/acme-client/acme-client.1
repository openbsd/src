.Sh NAME
.Nm acme-client
.Nd ACME client
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm acme-client
.Op Fl ADFnrv
.Op Fl f Ar configfile
.Ar domain
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is an
Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) client.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Create a new RSA account key if one does not already exist.
.It Fl D
Create a new RSA domain key if one does not already exist.
.It Fl F
Force updating the certificate signature even if it's too soon.
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl n
No operation: check and print configuration.
.It Fl r
Revoke the X509 certificate found in the certificates.
.It Fl v
Verbose operation.
Specify twice to also trace communication and data transfers.
.It Ar domain
The domain name.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
looks in its configuration for a
.Ar domain
section corresponding to the domain given as command line argument.
It then uses that configuration to retrieve a TLS certificate.
If the certificate already exists and is less than 30 days from expiry,
.Nm
will attempt to refresh the signature.
Before a certificate can be requested, an account key needs to be
created using the
.Fl A
argument.
The first time a certificate is requested, the RSA key needs to be created with
.Fl D .
.Pp
Challenges are used to verify that the submitter has access to the
registered domains.
.Nm
only implements the
.Dq http-01
challenge type, where a file is created within a directory accessible
by a locally-run web server.
The default challenge directory
.Pa /var/www/acme
can be served by
.Xr httpd 8
with this location block,
which will properly map response challenges:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
location "/.well-known/acme-challenge/*" {
	root "/acme"
	root strip 2
}
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/acme-client.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/acme-client.conf
Default configuration.
.It Pa /var/www/acme
Default challengedir.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
returns 1 on failure, 2 if the certificates didn't change (up to date),
or 0 if certificates were changed (revoked or updated).
.Sh EXAMPLES
To initialize a new account and Domain key:
.Pp
.Dl # acme-client -vAD example.com
.Pp
To create and submit a new key for a single domain, assuming that the
web server has already been configured to map the challenge directory
as above:
.Pp
.Dl # acme-client -vD example.com
.Pp
A daily
.Xr cron 8
job can renew the certificates:
.Pp
.Dl acme-client example.com && rcctl reload httpd
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr openssl 1 ,
.Xr acme-client.conf 5 ,
.Xr httpd.conf 5

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Ox 6.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was written by
.An Kristaps Dzonsons Aq Mt kristaps@bsd.lv .
.Sh BUGS
The challenge and certificate processes currently retain their (root)
privileges.
.Pp
For the time being,
.Nm
only supports RSA as an account key format.
