This is a simple test environment for running bind9 system tests
involving multiple name servers.

There are multiple test suites, each in a separate subdirectory and
involving a different DNS setup.  They are:

  dnssec/	DNSSEC tests
  forward/	Forwarding tests
  glue/		Glue handling tests
  limits/	Tests of handling of large data (close to server limits)
  lwresd/	Tests of the lightweight resolver library and daemon
  notify/	More NOTIFY tests
  nsupdate/	Dynamic update and IXFR tests
  resolver/     Regression tests for resolver bugs that have been fixed
		(not a complete resolver test suite)
  stub/		Tests of stub zone functionality
  unknown/	Unknown type and class tests
  upforwd/	Update forwarding tests
  views/	Tests of the "views" statement
  xfer/		Zone transfer tests
  xferquota/	Zone transfer quota tests

Typically each test suite sets up 2-5 name servers and then performs
one or more tests against them.  Within the test suite subdirectory,
each name server has a separate subdirectory containing its
configuration data.  By convention, these subdirectories are named
"ns1", "ns2", etc.

The tests are completely self-contained and do not require access to
the real DNS.  Generally, one of the test servers (ns1) is set up as a
root name server and is listed in the hints file of the others.

To enable all servers to run on the same machine, they bind to
separate virtual IP address on the loopback interface.  ns1 runs on
10.53.0.1, ns2 on 10.53.0.2, etc.  Before running any tests, you must
set up these addresses by running "ifconfig.sh up" as root.

The servers use port 5300 instead of the usual port 53, so they can be
run without root privileges once the interfaces have been set up.

The tests can be run individually like this:

  sh run.sh xfer
  sh run.sh notify
  etc.

To run all the tests, just type "make test".
