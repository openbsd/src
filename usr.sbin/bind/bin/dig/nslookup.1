.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm nslookup
.Nd query Internet name servers interactively
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl option
.Op Ar name | -
.Op Ar server
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command queries Internet domain name servers.
It has two modes: interactive and non-interactive.
Interactive mode allows the user to query name servers for information about
various hosts and domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain.
Non-interactive mode is used to print just the name and requested information
for a host or domain.
.Pp
Interactive mode is entered in the following cases:
.Bl -enum
.It
when no arguments are given (the default name server will be used)
.It
when the first argument is a hyphen (-) and the second argument is
the host name or Internet address of a name server.
.El
.Pp
Non-interactive mode is used when the name or Internet address of the
host to be looked up is given as the first argument.
The optional second
argument specifies the host name or address of a name server.
.Pp
Options can also be specified on the command line if they precede the
arguments and are prefixed with a hyphen.
For example, to change the default query type to host information, and the
initial timeout to 10 seconds, type:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nslookup -query=hinfo -timeout=10
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fl version
option causes
.Nm
to print the version
number and immediately exits.
.Sh INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic host Op Ar server
Look up information for host using the current default server or
using server, if specified.
If host is an Internet address and the query type is A or PTR, the name of the

If host is a name and does not have a trailing period, the search list is used
to qualify the name.

To look up a host not in the current domain, append a period to the name.
.It Ic server Ar domain
.It Ic lserver Ar domain
Change the default server to
.Ar domain ;
.Ic lserver
