# This value should be increased whenever changing the structure of
# any object that will appear in a type 'map' master file (which
# contains a working memory image of an RBT database), as loading 
# an incorrect memory image produces an inconsistent and probably
# nonfunctional database.  These structures include but are not
# necessarily limited to dns_masterrawheader, rbtdb_file_header,
# rbt_file_header, dns_rbtdb, dns_rbt, dns_rbtnode, rdatasetheader.
#
# Err on the side of caution: if anything in the RBTDB is changed,
# bump the value.  Making map files unreadable protects the system
# from instability; it's a feature not a bug.
#
# Whenever releasing a new major release of BIND9, set this value
# back to 1.0 when releasing the first alpha.  Fast files are *never*
# compatible across major releases.
