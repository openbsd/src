.Sh NAME
.Nm rarpd
.Nd reverse ARP daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rarpd
.Op Fl adflt
.Op Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
services Reverse ARP requests on the Ethernet connected to
.Ar interface .
Upon receiving a request,
.Nm
maps the target hardware address to an IP address via its name, which
must be present in both the
.Xr ethers 5
and
.Xr hosts 5
databases.
If a host does not exist in both databases, the translation cannot
proceed and a reply will not be sent.
.Pp
In normal operation,
.Nm
forks a copy of itself and runs in the background.
Anomalies and errors are reported via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If
.Fl a
is omitted, an
.Ar interface
must be specified.
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode, with all the output to stderr.
This option implies the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl f
Run in the foreground.
.It Fl l
Log all requests to
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl t
Only honour a request if the server
(i.e., the host that rarpd is running on)
can "boot" the target; that is, if a file or directory called
.Pa /tftpboot/ Ns Em ipaddr
exists, where
.Pa ipaddr
is the target IP address expressed in uppercase hexidecimal
(only the first 8 characters of filenames are checked).
