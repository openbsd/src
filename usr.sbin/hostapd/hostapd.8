.Nd Host Access Point daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm hostapd

.Op Fl a Ar interface
.Oo Xo
.Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value Oc

.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an daemon which allows communication between different 802.11
wireless access points running in
.Pa Host AP
mode.
.Pp
.Nm
implements the Inter Access Points Protocol (IAPP).
It's purpose is to exchange station association updates between access
points in large wireless networks.
IAPP has been designed to speed up roaming between different access
points in the same
.Pa BSS .
IAPP is described in the 
.Pa IEEE 802.11f
standard.
.Pp
.Nm
additionally allows to monitor and to log stations associations on a
non-hostap host which is receiving IAPP messages.
.Pp
.Nm
uses two network interfaces as options on startup.
The first interface
.Pa ( Fl a Ar interface )
is used to access the
.Pa Host AP ,
which is a wireless interface running in Host AP mode. Please use
.Xr ifconfig 4
to enable Host AP mode. The second interface
.Pa ( Fl i Ar interface )
is used to communicate with other
.Nm
in the same broadcast domain or multicast group.
Usually a wired interface is used to communicate with other
.Nm .
.Pp
The
.Nm
will send an
.Pa ADD.notify
IAPP message if a new station has been associated successfully to the
.Pa Host AP .
If the
.Nm
receives 
.Pa ADD.notify
messages it will request the
.Pa Host AP
to remove a station which has been associated to another access point.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar interface
Specify the 802.11 wireless network interface running in
.Pa Host AP
mode.
This this option could be omitted to use the
.Nm
to log received
.Pa IAPP
messages.
.It Fl b
Use UDP broadcast instead of multicast group 224.0.1.178 for IAPP
messages.
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as the configuration file, instead of the default
.Pa /etc/hostapd.conf .
.It Fl i Ar interface
Specify the network interface used to send
.Pa IAPP
messages.
It is important that the IAPP interface is on a trusted
network because there is no authentication and an attacker could force
disassociation of selected stations on all listening access points.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.

.Re
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
depends on drivers using the
.Pa net80211
kernel wireless layer with support of
.Pa Host AP mode.
For traditional reasons,
the
.Xr wi 4
driver still uses it's own Host AP code in
.Pa if_wi_hostap
which is not supported by
.Nm .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared on the 21th Chaos Communication Congress
(http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/) and later in
.Ox 3.8 .
