.Sh NAME
.Nm hostapd.conf
.Nd configuration file for the Host Access Point daemon
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the
.Xr hostapd 8
daemon.
.Sh SECTIONS
The
.Nm
file is divided into two main sections.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Tables
Tables provide a mechanism to handle large number of linker layer
addresses easily with increased performance and flexibility.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global runtime settings for
.Xr hostapd 8 .
.It Sy Event rules
Event rules provide a powerful mechanism to trigger certain actions
when receiving specified IEEE 802.11 frames.
.El
.Pp
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
.Sh MACROS
Much like
.Xr cpp 1
or
.Xr m4 1 ,
macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits
and underscores.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic set ,
.Ic interface ,
or
.Ic hostap ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
wlan="ath0"
set iapp interface $wlan
.Ed
.Sh TABLES
Tables are named structures which can hold a collection of link layer
addresses, masked address ranges and link layer to IP address
assignments. Lookups against tables in
.Xr hostapd 8
are relatively fast, making a single rule with tables much more
efficient, in terms of processor usage and memory consumption, than a
large number of rules which differ only in link layer addresses.
.Pp
Tables are used for
.Xr hostapd 8
.Ic event rules
to match specified IEEE 802.11 link layer addresses and address ranges
and the capability to assign link layer to IP addresses is a
requirement for advanced IAPP functionality.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cisco="00:40:06:ff:ff:ff / ff:ff:ff:00:00:00"

table <black> { $cisco, 00:0d:60:ff:f1:2a }
table <myess> const {
	00:00:24:c3:40:18 -> 10.195.64.24,
	00:00:24:c3:40:19 -> 10.195.64.25,
	00:00:24:c3:40:1a -> 10.195.64.26
}
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
The following configuration settings are understood:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Ic set hostap interface Ar interface
Specify the wireless interface running in Host AP mode.
This option could be omitted to use
.Xr hostapd 8
to log received IAPP messages.
.It Ic set iapp interface Ar interface
Specify the mandatory Inter-Access-Point (IAPP) interface.
.It Ic set iapp mode Ar mode
Specify the IAPP mode, if not using the default one.
IAPP could be used in multicast (default) or in broadcast mode.
The used multicast group is 224.0.1.178.
.Pp
Possible options:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ar set iapp mode multicast
.Ar set iapp mode broadcast
.Ed
.El
.Sh EVENT RULES
Event rules provide a powerful way to trigger a certain action when
receiving specified IEEE 802.11 frames on the 
.Ic hostap interface .
The rules are handled in sequential order, from first to last.
.Pp
In difference to packet filter rules like in
.Xr pf.conf 5 ,
the
.Xr hostapd 8
event rules are handled without a state,
each rule is processed indepedently from the others and from
any previous actions.
.Pp
All hostapd event rules are single line statements beginning with
the mandatory
.Ic hostap handle
keywords and optional rule options, frame matching,
a specified action and a limit.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ar hostap handle [<option>] [<frame>] [<action>] [<limit>]
.Ed
.Pp
The optional parts are defined below:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Ar <option>
The rule
.Ic option
will modify the behaviour of handling the statement.
There are two possible options,
.Ar quick
and
.Ar skip .
If either the keyword
.Ar quick
or the keyword
.Ar skip
is specified, no further event rules will be handled for this frame
after processing this rule successfully.
The keyword
.Ar skip
additionally skips any further IAPP processing of the frame,
which is normally done after handling the event rules.
.It Ar [<type>] [<subtype>] [<dir>] [<from>] [<to>] [<bssid>]
The
.Ic frame
description specifies a mechanism to match IEEE 802.11 frames.
.It Ar with <action>
An optional
.Ic action
is triggered if a received IEEE 802.11 frame matches the frame
description. The following choice are available as an
.Ic action :
.Bd -literal
.Ar frame <type> <subtype> [<dir>] <from> <to> <bssid>
.Ed
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic type :
.Ar type data
.Ar type management
.Ed
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic subtype :
.Ar subtype beacon
.Ar subtype deauth [<reason>]
.Ar subtype assoc request
.Ar subtype assoc resp
.Ar subtype atim
.Ar subtype auth
.Ar subtype probe request
.Ar subtype probe resp
.Ar subtype reassoc request
.Ar subtype reassoc response
.Ed
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic reason :
.Ar reason assoc leave
.Ar reason assoc not authed
.Ar reason assoc toomany
.Ar reason auth expire
.Ar reason auth leave
.Ar reason ie invalid
.Ar reason mic failure
.Ar reason not authed
.Ar reason not assoced
.Ar reason rsn required
.Ar reason rsn inconsistent
.Ar reason unspecified
.Ed
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic dir :
.Ar dir no ds
.Ar dir to ds
.Ar dir from ds
.Ar dir ds to ds
.Ed
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic from/to/bssid :
.Ar ( from | to | bssid ) lladdr
.Ar ( from | to | bssid ) &refaddr
.Ed
.Pp
.Bd -literal
.Ar iapp radiotap
.Ar log [verbose]
.Ar node ( add | delete ) <lladdr>
.Ar resend
.Ed
.It Ar limit <number> ( sec | usec )
It is possible to
.Ic limit
handling of specific rules.
In some cases it is absolutely necessary to use limited matching
to protect
.Xr hostapd 8
against excessive flooding with IEEE 802.11 frames.
In example, beacon frames will be normally received every 100 ms.
