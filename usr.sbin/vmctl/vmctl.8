.Dt VMCTL 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vmctl
.Nd control the virtual machine daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar command
.Op Ar arg ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to control the virtual machine monitor (VMM) subsystem.
A VMM manages virtual machines (VMs) on a host.
The VMM subsystem is responsible for creating, destroying, and executing
VMs.
.Pp
Within the commands,
the
.Ar size
argument can be specified with a human-readable scale,
using the format described in
.Xr scan_scaled 3 .
The
.Ar id
argument can be either a numeric, non-zero identifier or alternatively
the name of a virtual machine.
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm console Ar id
Using
.Xr cu 1
connect to the console of the VM with the specified
.Ar id .
.It Cm create Ar path Fl s Ar size
Creates a VM disk image file with the specified
.Ar path
and
.Ar size ,
rounded to megabytes.
.It Cm load Ar filename
Load additional configuration from the specified file.
.It Cm log brief
Disable verbose debug logging.
.It Cm log verbose
Enable verbose debug logging.
.It Cm pause Ar id
Pause a VM with the specified
.Ar id .
.It Cm receive Ar name
Receive a VM from standard input and start it with the specified
.Ar name .
.It Cm reload
Remove all stopped VMs and reload the configuration from the default
configuration file.
.It Cm reset Op Cm all
Reset the running state.
.It Cm reset switches
Reset the configured switches.
.It Cm reset vms
Reset and terminate all VMs.
.It Cm send Ar id
Send a VM with the specified
.Ar id
to standard output and terminate it.
.It Cm show Op Ar id
An alias for the
.Cm status
command.
.It Xo Cm start Ar name
.Op Fl cL
.Op Fl b Ar path
.Op Fl d Ar path
.Op Fl i Ar count
.Op Fl m Ar size
.Op Fl n Ar switch
.Bk -words
.Op Fl r Ar path
.Ek
.Xc
Starts a VM defined by the specified name and parameters:
.Bl -tag -width "-i count"
.It Fl b Ar path
Boot the VM with the specified kernel or BIOS image.
If not specified, the default is to boot using the BIOS image in
.Pa /etc/firmware/vmm-bios .
.It Fl c
Automatically connect to the VM console.
.It Fl d Ar path
Disk image file (may be specified multiple times to add multiple disk images).
.It Fl i Ar count
Number of network interfaces to add to the VM.
.It Fl L
Add a local network interface.
.Xr vmd 8
will auto-generate an IPv4 subnet for the interface,
configure a gateway address on the VM host side,
and run a simple DHCP/BOOTP server for the VM.
See
.Sx LOCAL INTERFACES
below for more information on how addresses are calculated and assigned when
using the
.Fl L
option.
.It Fl m Ar size
Memory
.Ar size
of the VM, rounded to megabytes.
The default is 512M.
.It Fl n Ar switch
Add a network interface that is attached to the specified virtual
.Ar switch .
See
.Sx SWITCH CONFIGURATION
in
.Xr vm.conf 5
for more information.
.It Fl r Ar path
ISO image file for virtual CD-ROM.
This image file will be available in the
selected VM as a SCSI CD-ROM device attached to a virtio SCSI adapter
(e.g.\&
.Xr vioscsi 4 ) .
.El
.Pp
Note that the VM name supplied to the 'start' command can only consist of
alphanumeric characters, including '.', '-', and '_'. The name cannot start
with '.', '-' or '_'.
.It Cm status Op Ar id
Lists VMs running on the host, optionally listing just the selected VM
.Ar id .
.It Cm stop Ar id
Stops (terminates) a VM defined by the specified VM
.Ar id .
A graceful shutdown will be attempted if the VM supports the
.Xr vmmci 4
device.
Once stopped, if the VM was not defined in a configuration file, then it is
removed.
.It Cm unpause Ar id
Unpause (resume from a paused state) a VM with the specified
.Ar id .
.El
.Pp
If the
.Fl i
option is specified during VM startup, a corresponding number
of host-side
.Xr tap 4
interfaces will be allocated and mapped to the
.Xr vio 4
interfaces inside the guest VM.
This tap/vio interface mapping
allows guest network traffic to be manipulated by the host.
Any valid host-side interface configuration may be performed on these
tap interfaces, such as bridging (via
.Xr bridge 4 ) ,
or using
.Xr pf 4
nat-to rules to create private or host-side NATed networks, as desired.
.Sh LOCAL INTERFACES
Local interfaces can be used to easily configure VM networking without
needing to manually assign network addresses.
A local interface is added
to a VM using the -L option to the 'vmctl start' command and results in the
addition of a
.Xr vio 4
interface inside the VM and a corresponding
.Xr tap 4
interface on the host.
When using local interfaces,
.Xr vmd 8
will provide DHCP services to the guest VM and offer addresses selected
from the 100.64.0.0/10 IPv4 range.
From within the 100.64.0.0/10
range,
.Xr vmd 8
allocates a pair of addresses for the guest-side
.Xr vio 4
and host-side
.Xr tap 4
interfaces as follows:
.Pp
For the first local interface:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
The host (tapX) address is assigned 100.64.n.2,
where 'n' is the numeric VM ID visible in the 'vmctl status' command
.It
The guest (vio0) address is assigned 100.64.n.3
.El
.Pp
For the second and subsequent local interface(s):
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
The second local interface uses 100.64.n.4 and 100.64.n.5 for the
host (tapX) and guest (vio1) interfaces, respectively.
.It
Subsequent local interfaces are numbered similarly, continuing with 100.64.n.6
and 100.64.n.7, etc
.El
.Pp
Multiple -L options can be provided to the 'vmctl start' command, if more than
one interface is desired.
Local interfaces are assigned to the VM before
any other interfaces specified with the -i option (thus, local interfaces,
if requested, are numbered starting at vio0 inside the guest VM).
.Pp
When using local interfaces, the DHCP configuration offered to the guest VM
specifies the address of the corresponding host
.Xr tap 4
interface as both the default route and the (sole) nameserver.
Guest VM traffic can optionally be NATed through the host
with an entry in the host machine's
.Pa /etc/pf.conf
similar to the following (if desired):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pass out on $ext_if from 100.64.0.0/10 to any nat-to $ext_if
.Ed
.Pp
If NATing is desired, the net.inet.ip.forwarding sysctl must also be set to 1.
.Pp
If desired, DNS queries originating from Guest VMs can be redirected to a
different DNS server with an entry in the host machine's
.Pa /etc/pf.conf
similar to the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pass in proto udp from 100.64.0.0/10 to any port domain \e
      rdr-to $dns_server port domain
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/var/run/vmd.sockXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/vm.conf
Default configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/vmd.sock
.Ux Ns -domain
socket used for communication with
.Xr vmd 8 .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std vmctl
.Nm
may fail due to one of the following reasons:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
The VMM subsystem could not be enabled or disabled as requested.
.It
A requested VM-based operation could not be completed.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a 4.5 Gigabyte disk image, disk.img:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ vmctl create disk.img -s 4.5G
.Ed
.Pp
Create a new VM with 1GB memory, one network interface, one disk image
('disk.img') and boot from kernel '/bsd':
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# vmctl start "myvm" -m 1G -i 1 -b /bsd -d disk.img
.Ed
.Pp
.Xr vmd 8
will create a new
.Xr tap 4
network interface on the host side and set the description to indicate
the VM by ID, interface number, and name:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig tap0
tap0: flags=8842<BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
	lladdr fe:e1:ba:d8:50:d1
	description: vm1-if0-myvm
	index 15 priority 0 llprio 3
	groups: tap
	status: active
.Ed
.Pp
Terminate VM number 1:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# vmctl stop 1
.Ed
