.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rpki-client
.Nd validates the RPKI tree and produces VRPs to be used in
.Xr bgpd 8
for Origin Validation.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fnqrv
.Op Fl e Ar rsync_prog
.Ar tal1 tal2 ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility produces all route announcements starting with trust anchor
locators.
It uses
.Xr openrsync 1
to fetch certificates, manifests, revocation lists, and route
announcements themselves.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e Ar rsync_prog
Use
.Ar rsync_prog
instead of
.Xr openrsync 1
to fetch repositories.
It must accept the
.Fl rlt
and
.Fl -delete
flags and connect with rsync-protocol locations.
.It Fl f
Accept out-of-date manifests.
This will still report if a manifest has expired.
.It Fl n
Assume that all requested repositories exist: don't update.
.It Fl q
Don't emit any Validated RPKI Payloads (VRPs).
.It Fl r
Don't parse certificate revocation files.
This additional step can take a long time.
.It Fl v
Specified once, prints information about status.
Twice, prints each filename as it's processed.
.It Ar tal
A trust anchor locator (TAL) file.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
produces a list of unique
.Li roa-set
statements as specified by
.Xr bgpd.conf 5
on standard output.
