.Sh NAME
.Nm rpki-client
.Nd RPKI validation for bgpd Route Origin Validation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Bcfjnrv
.Op Fl b Ar bind_addr
.Op Fl e Ar rsync_prog
.Op Fl T Ar table
.Op Fl t Ar tal
.Op Ar output
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility produces all route announcements starting with trust anchor
locators.
It uses
.Xr openrsync 1
to fetch certificates, manifests, revocation lists, and route
announcements themselves.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B
Format the output suitable for the BIRD internet routing daemon.
.It Fl b Ar bind_addr
Tell the rsync client to use the specified
.Ar bind_addr
as the source address for connections.
.It Fl c
Format the output as comma-separated values of the prefix in slash notation,
the maximum prefix length, the autonomous system number, and an abbreviation
for the trust anchor the entry is derived from.
.It Fl e Ar rsync_prog
Use
.Ar rsync_prog
instead of
.Xr openrsync 1
to fetch repositories.
It must accept the
.Fl rlt ,
.Fl -address
and
.Fl -delete
flags and connect with rsync-protocol locations.
.It Fl f
Accept out-of-date manifests.
This will still report if a manifest has expired.
.It Fl j
Format the output as JSON object.
This format is identical to that
produced by the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator and NLnet Labs routinator.
.It Fl n
Assume that all requested repositories exist: don't update.
.It Fl T Ar table
For BIRD output use
.Ar table
as roa table name instead of the default 'roa'.
.It Fl t Ar tal
Specify a trust anchor locator (TAL) file to be used.
This option can be used multiple times to load multiple TALs.
By default
.Nm
will load all TAL files in
.Pa /etc/rpki .
.It Fl v
Specified once, prints information about status.
Twice, prints each filename as it's processed.
.It Ar output
The file
.Nm
will write the
.Li roa-set
to.
Defaults to
.Pa /var/db/rpki-client/roa .
.El
.Pp
By default
.Nm
produces a list of unique
.Li roa-set
statements as specified by
.Xr bgpd.conf 5 .
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/db/rpki-client/roaXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/rpki/*.tal
default TAL files used unless
.Fl t Ar tal
is specified.
.It Pa /var/cache/rpki-client
cached repository data.
.It Pa /var/db/rpki-client/roa
default roa-set output file.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.\" For sections 1, 6, and 8 only.
.\" .Sh EXAMPLES
.\" .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\" For sections 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 printf/stderr messages only.
