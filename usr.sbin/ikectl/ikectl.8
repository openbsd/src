.Ar command
.Op Ar arg ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program controls the
.Xr iked 8
daemon and provides commands to maintain a simple X.509 certificate
authority (CA) for IKEv2 peers.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use
.Ar socket
instead of the default
.Pa /var/run/iked.sock
to communicate with
.Xr iked 8 .

.Xr iked 8 :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm active
Set
.Xr iked 8
to active mode.
.It Cm passive

.Xr iked 8
to passive mode.
In passive mode no packets are sent to peers and no connections
are initiated by
.Xr iked 8 .
.It Cm couple

a public key infrastructure (PKI) has to be set up to create and sign
the peer certificates.
.Nm
includes commands to simplify maintenance of the PKI
and to set up a simple certificate authority (CA) for
.Xr iked 8
and its peers.
.Pp
The following commands are available to control the CA:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm ca Ar name Cm create
Create a new certificate authority with the specified
.Ar name .
.It Cm ca Ar name Cm delete
Delete the certificate authority with the specified
.Ar name .
.It Cm ca Ar name Cm install
Install the certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) for CA
.Ar name
as the currently active CA.
.It Cm ca Ar name Cm certificate Ar host Cm create
Create a private key and certificate for
.Ar host
and sign then with the key of certificate authority with the speicified
.Ar name .
.It Cm ca Ar name Cm certificate Ar host Cm delete
Deletes the private key and and certificates associated with
.Ar host .
.It Cm ca Ar name Cm certificate Ar host Cm export
