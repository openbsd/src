.Os FreeBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_info
.Nd a utility for displaying information on software packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_info
.Op Fl cDdfIikLmpqRrvh
.Op Fl e Ar package
.Op Fl l Ar prefix
.Ar pkg-name [pkg-name ...]
.Nm pkg_info
.Op Fl a Ar flags
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to dump out information for packages, which may be either
packed up in files or already installed on the system with the
.Xr pkg_create 1
command.
.Pp
The
.Ar pkg-name
may be the name of an installed package, the pathname to a package
distribution file, or a URL to an ftp-available package.
.Pp
The following command-line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Show information for all currently installed packages.
.It Fl c
Show the one-line comment field for each package.
.It Fl D
Show the install-message file (if any) for each package.
.It Fl d
Show the long-description field for each package.
.It Fl e Ar pkg-name
If the package identified by
.Ar pkg-name
is currently installed, return 0, otherwise return 1.
If the given pkg-name contains a
shell metacharacter, it will be matched against all installed
packages using
.Xr fnmatch 3 ,
and any packages found installed are printed to stdout, one name per
line.
.Xr csh 1
style {,} alternates have also been implemented.
Dewey decimal numbers can also be matched in a relational manner,
using the
.Pa >=, <=, >
and
.Pa <
operators.
For example,
.Pa pkg_info -e 'name>=1.3'
will match versions 1.3 and later of the
.Pa name
package.
This printing can be turned off using the
.Fl q
option.
This option
allows you to test for the presence of another (perhaps
prerequisite) package from a script.
.It Fl f
Show the packing list instructions for each package.
.It Fl I
Show the index entry for each package.
.It Fl i
Show the install script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl k
Show the de-install script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl L
Show the files within each package.  This is different from just
viewing the packing list, since full pathnames for everything
are generated.
.It Fl l Ar str
Prefix each information category header (see
.Fl q )
shown with
.Ar str .
This is primarily of use to front-end programs that want to request a
lot of different information fields at once for a package, but don't
necessary want the output intermingled in such a way that they can't
organize it.  This lets you add a special token to the start of
each field.
.It Fl m
Show the mtree file (if any) for each package.
.It Fl p
Show the installation prefix for each package.
.It Fl q
Be ``quiet'' in emitting report headers and such, just dump the
raw info (basically, assume a non-human reading).
.It Fl R
Show which packages are required by each package.
.It Fl r
Show the requirements script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PKG_DBDIR
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
The standard package database directory,
.Pa /var/db/pkg ,
can be overridden by specifying an alternative directory in the
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
environment variable.
.It Ev PKG_PATH
This can be used to specify a colon-separated list of paths to search for
package files.  The current directory is always searched first, even if
.Ev PKG_PATH
is set.  If
.Ev PKG_PATH
is used, the suffix
.Pa .tgz
is automatically appended to the
.Ar pkg-name ,
whereas searching in the current directory uses
.Ar pkg-name
literally.
.It Ev PKG_TMPDIR , Ev TMPDIR
These are tried in turn (if set) as candidate directories in which
to create a ``staging area'' for any files extracted by
.Nm
from package files.  If neither
.Ev PKG_TMPDIR
nor
.Ev TMPDIR
yields a suitable scratch directory,
.Pa /var/tmp ,
.Pa /tmp ,
and
.Pa /usr/tmp
are tried in turn.  Note that
.Pa /usr/tmp
may be created, if it doesn't already exist.
.Pp
Since
.Nm
requires very little information to be extracted from any package
files examined, it is unlikely that these environment variables would
ever need to be used to work around limited available space in the
default locations.
.El
.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
Package info is either extracted from package files named on the
command line, or from already installed package information
in
.Pa /var/db/pkg/<pkg-name> .
