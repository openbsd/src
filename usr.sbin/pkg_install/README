This is the pkg_install suite of tools for doing maintenance of
software "packages".  More documentation is available in the man pages
for each individual command.

This code was written by Jordan Hubbard for FreeBSD, snatched and
mildly reshaped by John Kohl in NetBSD and the changes taken back into
FreeBSD again by Jordan, who then proceeded to add another couple
of dozen features on top.  Whee! :-)

In another round of enhancements, NetBSD changes were added by
Alistair Crooks, Hubert Feyrer and Thorsten Frueauf.   These changes
were incorporated into this version of the pkg tools in October, 1998.

Marc Espie has made further changes/improvements since then.
