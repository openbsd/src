.Sh NAME
.Nm acpid
.Nd Advanced Configuration and Power Interface daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm acpid
.Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
monitors the advanced configuration and power interface (ACPI) device,
acting of signaled events.
For suspend and poweroff request events delivered by the BIOS,
.Nm
runs the appropriate program (if one exists).
.Pp
If the
.Fl d
flag is specified,
.Nm
enters debug mode, logging to facility
.Dv LOG_LOCAL1
and staying in the foreground on the controlling terminal.
.Pp
Actions can be configured for the following two events:
.Cm suspend
and
.Cm powerdown .
The suspend actions are run when the sleep button is pressed, while
the powerdown action is run when the power button is pressed.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /etc/acpi/suspend
and
.Pa /etc/acpi/powerdown
are the files that contain the host's customized actions.
Each file must be an executable binary or shell script suitable
for execution by the
.Xr execve 2
function.
If you wish to have the same program or script control all transitions, it
may determine which transition is in progress by examining its
.Va argv[0]
which is set to one of
.Ar suspend
and
.Ar powerdown .
.Pp
.Pa /dev/acpi
is the default device used to control the ACPI kernel driver.
