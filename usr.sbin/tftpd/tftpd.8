.Sh NAME
.Nm tftpd
.Nd DARPA Trivial File Transfer Protocol daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tftpd
.Op Fl 46cdv
.Op Fl l Ar address
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl r Ar socket
.Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a server which implements the
.Tn DARPA
Trivial File Transfer Protocol.
.Pp
The use of
.Xr tftp 1
does not require an account or password on the remote system.
Due to the lack of authentication information,
.Nm
will allow only publicly readable files to be accessed.
Files may be written only if they already exist and are publicly writable,
unless the
.Fl c
flag is specified
.Pq see below .
Note that this extends the concept of
.Dq public
to include
all users on all hosts that can be reached through the network;
this may not be appropriate on all systems, and its implications
should be considered before enabling TFTP service.
.Pp
The server must be started as root, but will chroot to the
.Ar directory
specified on the command line and drop privileges to the _tftpd user.
.Pp
.Nm tftpd
always provides random data at the path
.Pa /etc/random.seed ,
and therefore this path will be ignored inside the
.Ar directory .
.Ox
network bootloaders access this path to harvest entropy during
kernel load.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl c
Allow new files to be created;
otherwise uploaded files must already exist.
Files are created with default permissions
allowing anyone to read or write to them.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log
the client IP, type of request, and filename to stderr.
.It Fl l Ar address
Listen on the specified address.
By default
.Nm
listens on wildcard addresses.
.It Fl p Ar port
Listen on the specified port.
By default
.Nm
listens on the port indicated in the
.Ql tftp
service description; see
.Xr services 5 .
.It Fl r Ar socket
Issue filename rewrite requests to the specified UNIX domain socket.
.Nm
will write lines in the format "IP OP filename", terminated by a newline,
where IP is the client's IP address, and OP is one of "read" or "write".
.Nm
expects replies in the format "filename" terminated by a newline.
All rewrite requests from the daemon must be answered
(even if it is with the original filename)
before the TFTP request will continue.
By default
.Nm
does not use filename rewriting.
.It Fl v
Log the client IP, type of request, and filename.
.It Ar directory
.Xr chroot 2
to
.Ar directory
on startup;
the remote host is not expected to pass the directory
as part of the file name to transfer.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tftp 1 ,
.Xr pxeboot 8 ,
.Xr syslogd 8 ,
.Xr tftp-proxy 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command was originally a process run via
.Xr inetd 8
and appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
It was rewritten for
.Ox 5.2
as a persistent non-blocking daemon.
.Sh BUGS
Many TFTP clients will not transfer files over 16744448 octets
.Pq 32767 blocks .
