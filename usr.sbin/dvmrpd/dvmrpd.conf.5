.Sh NAME
.Nm dvmrpd.conf
.Nd Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr dvmrpd 8
daemon implements the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol as described
in draft-ietf-idmr-dvmrp-v3-11 DVMRP Version 3.
.Pp
The
.Nm
config file is divided into the following main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr dvmrpd 8 .
A number of global settings can be overruled in specific areas or interfaces.
.It Sy Groups
Groups are used to group similar interfaces, simplifying configuration.
.El
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic area ,
.Ic interface ,
or
.Ic hello-interval ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hi="60"
group {
	interface em0 {
		query-interval $hi
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
The same can be accomplished by specifying the query-interval
globally or within the group declaration.
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
All interface related settings can be configured globally, per group and per
interface.
The only settings that can be set globally and not overruled are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic mfc-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
the kernel Multicast Forwarding Cache is updated with information from the
daemon.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.El
.Sh GROUPS
Groups can be used to easily configure similar interfaces.
All interface-specific parameters can
be configured per group, overruling the global settings.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic group
Specify a group section, grouping one or more interfaces.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
group {
	robustness 4

	interface em0
	interface em1
}
.Ed
.El
.Sh INTERFACES
Each interface can have several parameters configured individually, otherwise
they are inherited.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
interface em0 {
}
.Ed
.Pp
Interface-specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic igmp-version Ar number
Do not use a newer version than specified.
Valid range 1\(en2.
The default version used is 2.
.It Ic last-member-query-count Ar count
The default value is equal to the default robustness variable;
valid range is 1\(en255.
.It Ic last-member-query-interval Ar seconds
The default value is 10; valid range is 1\(en65535.
.It Ic metric Ar cost
Set the interface metric a.k.a. cost.
The default value is 1; valid range is
1\(en31.
.It Ic passive
Prevent transmission and reception of IGMP and DVMRP packets on this interface.
.It Ic query-interval Ar seconds
Set the query interval.
The default value is 125 seconds; valid range is 1\(en65535 seconds.
.It Ic query-response-interval Ar seconds
Set the query-response-interval; note that this must be less
than the query-interval.
The default value is 100 seconds; valid range is 1\(en65535 seconds.
.It Ic robustness Ar factor
Set the robustness factor; note that this value might
have an impact on other variables.
The default value is 2; valid range is 1\(en4.
.It Ic startup-query-count Ar count
Set the startup-query-interval, used during startup to speed up the process of
building the IGMP table for an interface.
The default value is equal to the default robustness variable; valid range is
the same as the robustness variable.
.It Ic startup-query-interval Ar seconds
Used during startup, see the startup-query-interval.
The default value is query-interval / 4; valid range is the same as the
query-interval.
