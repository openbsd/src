.Sh NAME
.Nm DynRootDB
.Nd AFS cells and database servers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
specifies what AFS cells that should appear in the AFS root
.Pa ( /afs )
when starting
.Nm afsd .
.Pp
Each line in the file should contain one cell, for example:
.Bd -literal
stacken.kth.se
e.kth.se
nada.kth.se
it.kth.se
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
is read when 
.Nm afsd
is started, normally when the system boots.
.Pp
If
.Nm
doesn't exist, then all cells listed in the CellServDB and the
dynamically found nodes appear in the
.Pa /afs
directory.
