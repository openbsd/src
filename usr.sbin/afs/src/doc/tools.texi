@c XXX History of RX

Rx is run over UDP.

One of rxgen or ydr is used to generate stub-files, ydr is better since
it generates prototypes, too.

The current implemetation of rx it not that beautiful.

@c XXX History of LWP

LWP is a preepmtive thread package. It does it's context-switching by
creating a private stack for each thread. The heart of the package is
select(2).

The stack is checked for overruns in context-switches, but that is often
too late. It might be an idea to add a @cite{red zone} at the top of the
stack to be able to detect overruns.
