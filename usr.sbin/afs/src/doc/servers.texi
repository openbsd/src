@section YDR

@cindex Ydr
@cindex Rxgen

@code{Ydr} is a rxgen replacement that is generating a lot more stuff
then rxgen (like headerfiles). It also does the same thing in one run
instead of three (rxgen does one run for ss.c cs.c and .h, and each time
passes the whole data thru cpp).

@code{Ydr} was created when there was no free rx package.

Things to remeber about ydr and ydr generated code:

@itemize @bullet

@item When a server function is done out mashalling and writing out data
it will free all data that contains VARRAYs. The functions you are
intressed in is @code{generate_server_stub} and @code{genfree}.

@item When a server functions fail (ie returns != 0), mashalling of 
out-data is not done, and out-data is not freed, instead rx_Error() is
called with that error (See @code{generate_server_stub}.

@item To use ydr (to describe when is codeing a struct or running ydr on 
a file) is called ydra.
