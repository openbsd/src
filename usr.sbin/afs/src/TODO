   TODO-list, in no particular order.

Please mail arla-drinkers@stacken.kth.se if you want to work on
any of these things so we don't do double work.

arlad/xfs: More stable, bugfixes etc

xfs/solaris: verify multithreadness

xfs+arlad: implement advisory locking

arlad: disconnected mode

arlad: remove unused stuff from FCacheEntry

arlad: fallback to disconnected mode if networking is not working
(possibly per cell)

arlad/xfs: return from open before fetching the whole file

test suite

OPTIMIZATIONS

This is a list of posible optimizations that could be done to different parts
of arla.

 - Store cache files in inodes. Bypass the upper layer of VFS to read and
   write cache.

 - Delay reads and writes to cache and AFS-servers. Make the more operations
   in one batch. (possible with rx?) Especially directories don't have to be
   synced for every operation.

 - send more messages to/from arlad in one sweep. (lookup on whole path in one
   message, getattr+getdata, etc..)
