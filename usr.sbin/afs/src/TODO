   TODO-list, in no particular order.

Please mail arla-drinkers@stacken.kth.se if you want to work on
any of these things so we don't do double work.

*/Makefile.in: homogenize

*/Makefile.in: allow creation of shared libraries

tests: make sure all tests work everywhere

tests: figure out what output should be sent where and with what options
	
arlad/xfs: More stable, bugfixes etc

xfs/solaris: verify multithreadness

xfs+arlad: implement advisory locking

xfs: support building as part of the kernel

xfs/irix: port to Irix 6.5

arlad: disconnected mode

arlad: remove unused stuff from FCacheEntry

arlad: fallback to disconnected mode if networking is not working
(possibly per cell)

arlad/xfs: return from open before fetching the whole file

arlad: more consistency checks before recovering state

more tests in test suite

cache in blocks (iff ?) file to large to fit in cache ?

rewrite milko (vfs-switch ?)

autoconf -j

OPTIMIZATIONS

This is a list of posible optimizations that could be done to different parts
of arla.

 - Delay reads and writes to cache and AFS-servers. Make the more operations
   in one batch. (possible with rx?) Especially directories don't have to be
   synced for every operation.

 - send more messages to/from arlad in one sweep. (lookup on whole path in one
   message, getattr+getdata, etc..)
