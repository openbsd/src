.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm makemap
.Ar mapdesc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates the database maps used by the keyed map lookups in

reads lines from the standard input consisting of two
words separated by whitespace.
The first is the database key,
the second is the value.
.Pp
Note:
use
.Xr newaliases 8
to create the aliases database, not
.Nm ,
as the input formats differ for historical reasons.

.Nm
command first appeared in
