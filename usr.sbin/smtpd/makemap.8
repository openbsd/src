.Sh NAME
.Nm makemap
.Nd create database maps for smtpd
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm makemap
.Op Fl o Ar dbfile
.Op Fl t Ar type
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Maps provide a generic interface for associating textual key to a value.
Such associations may be accessed through a plaintext file, database, or DNS.
The format of these file types is described below.
.Nm
itself creates the database maps used by keyed map lookups specified in
.Xr smtpd.conf 5 .
.Pp
.Nm
reads input from
.Ar file
and writes data to a file whose name is made by adding a
.Dq .db
suffix to
.Ar file .
In all cases,
.Nm
reads lines consisting of words separated by whitespace.
The first word of a line is the database key;
the remainder represents the mapped value.
The database key and value may optionally be separated
by the colon character.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar dbfile
Write the generated database to
.Ar dbfile .
.It Fl t Ar type
Specify the format of the resulting map file.
The default map format is suitable for storing simple, unstructured,
key-to-value string associations.
However, if the mapped value has special meaning,
as in the case of the virtual domains file,
a suitable
.Ar type
must be provided.
The available output types are:
.Bl -tag -width "aliases"
.It Cm aliases
The mapped value is a comma-separated list of mail destinations.
This format can be used for building user aliases and
virtual domains files.
.It Cm set
There is no mapped value \(en a map of this type will only allow for
the lookup of keys.
This format can be used for building primary domain maps.
.El
.Pp
.El
.Ex -std makemap
.Sh PRIMARY DOMAINS
Primary domains can be kept in maps.
To create a primary domain map, add each primary domain on a
single line by itself.
.Pp
In addition to adding an entry to the primary domain map,
one must add a filter rule that accepts mail for the domain
map, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
map "primary" { source db "/etc/mail/primary.db" }
accept for domain map "primary" deliver to mbox
.Ed
.Sh VIRTUAL DOMAINS
Virtual domains are kept in maps.
To create single virtual address, add
.Dq user@example.com	user
to the virtual map.
To handle all mail destined to any user at example.com, add
.Dq @example.com	user
to the virtual map.
.Pp
In addition to adding an entry to the virtual map,
one must add a filter rule that accepts mail for virtual domains,
for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
map "vdomains" { source db "/etc/mail/vdomains.db" }
accept for virtual "vdomains" deliver to mbox
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/mail/aliasesXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/mail/aliases
List of user mail aliases.
.It Pa /etc/mail/virtual
List of hosted virtual domains.
.It Pa /etc/mail/secrets
List of remote host credentials.

.Sh HISTORY
The

command first appeared in
.Ox 4.6
as a replacement for the equivalent command shipped with sendmail.
