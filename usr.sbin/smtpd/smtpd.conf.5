.Sh NAME
.Nm smtpd.conf
.Nd Simple Mail Transfer Protocol daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the mail daemon
.Xr smtpd 8 .
.Pp
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Arguments containing whitespace should be surrounded by double quotes
.Pq \&" .
.Pp
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits
and underscores.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example
.Ar listen ,
.Ar accept ,
.Ar port ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
wan_if = "fxp0"
listen on $wan_if
listen on $wan_if tls enable auth
.Ed
.Pp
Some configuration directives expect expansion of their parameters at runtime.
Such directives (for example
.Ar deliver to maildir ,
.Ar deliver to mda ,
.Ar relay via )
may use format specifiers which will be expanded before delivery or
relaying.
The following formats are currently supported:
%a expands to the user part of the email address prior to the
resolution of aliases;
%u expands to the user part after aliases
resolution and will typically be the system account;
%d expands to the domain part of the email address;
%U expands to the user part of the sender email address;
%D expands to the domain part of the sender email address.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/mail/smtpd.conf.local"
.Ed
.Pp
The syntax of
.Nm
is described below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic expire Ar n {s|m|h|d}
Specify how long a message can stay in the queue.
The default value is 4 days.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
expire 4d	# expire after 4 days
expire 10h	# expire after 10 hours
.Ed
.It Ic hostname Ar name
Specify the domain name of the server.
By default the current host name is used,
as returned by
.Xr hostname 1 .
.It Xo
.Ic listen on Ar interface
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ic tls | smtps
.Op Ic certificate Ar name
.Op Ic enable auth
.Xc
Specify an
.Ar interface
and
.Ar port
to listen on.
An interface group, an IP address or a domain name may
be used in place of
.Ar interface .
.Pp
Secured connections are provided either using STARTTLS
.Pq Ic tls ,
by default on port 25,
or SMTPS
.Pq Ic smtps ,
by default on port 465.
Host certificates may be used for these connections,
and are searched for in the
.Pa /etc/mail/certs
directory.
If
.Ic certificate
is specified,
a certificate
.Ao Ar name Ac Ns .crt ,
a key
.Ao Ar name Ac Ns .key
and Diffie-Hellman parameters
.Ao Ar name Ac Ns .dh
are searched for.
If no
.Ic certificate
is specified,
the default interface name is instead used,
for example
.Pa fxp0.crt ,
.Pa fxp0.key ,
and
.Pa fxp0.dh .
If no DH parameters are provided, smtpd will use
built-in parameters.
Creation of certificates is documented in
.Xr starttls 8 .
.Pp
If the
.Ic enable auth
parameter is used,
any remote sender that passed SMTPAUTH is treated as if
it was the server's local user that was sending the mail.
This means that filter rules using "from local" will be matched.
.It Xo
.Ic map Ar map
.No {
.Ic source Ar type Ar source
.No }
.Xc
Maps are used to provide additional configuration information for
.Xr smtpd 8 .
.Pp
.Ar map
may be named freely.
.Pp
.Ar type
may be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "fileXXX" -compact
.It db
Mappings are stored in a file created using
.Xr makemap 8 .
This is the default type if none is specified.
.It dns
Not implemented yet.
.It plain
Mappings are stored in a plain text file using the
same format as used to generate
.Xr makemap 8
mappings.
.El
.Pp
.Ar source
specifies the source of the map data.
It must be an absolute path to a file for the
.Dq file
and
.Dq db
map types,
or a domain name for the
.Dq dns
map type.
.It Ic size Ar n
Specify a maximum message size of
.Ar n
bytes.
The argument may contain a multiplier, as documented in
.Xr scan_scaled 3 .
.It Ic accept | reject
.Xr smtpd 8
accepts and rejects messages
based on information gathered during the SMTP session.
.Pp
For each message processed by the daemon,
the filter rules are evaluated in sequential order,
from first to last.
The first matching rule decides what action is taken.
If no rule matches the message,
the default action is to reject the message.
.Pp
Following the accept/reject
decision comes the client's IP address filter:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic from all
Make the rule match regardless of the IP of connecting client.
.It Ic from local
The rule matches only locally originating connections.
This is the default,
and may be omitted.
.It Ic from Ar network
The rule matches if the connection is made from the specified
.Ar network .
.El
.Pp
Next comes the selection based on the domain the message is sent to:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic for all
Make the rule match regardless of the domain it is sent to.
.It Xo
.Ic for domain Ar domain
.Op Ic alias Ar map
.Xc
This rule applies to mail destined for the specified
.Ar domain .
This parameter supports the
.Sq *
wildcard,
so that a single rule for all sub-domains can be used, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
accept for domain "*.example.com" deliver to mbox
.Ed
.Pp
If specified,
.Ar map
is used for looking up alternative destinations for addresses in this
.Ar domain .
.It Xo
.Ic for local
.Op Ic alias Ar map
.Xc
This rule applies to mail destined to
.Dq localhost
and to the server's fully qualified domain name,
as returned by
.Xr hostname 1 .
.It Ic for virtual Ar map
This rule applies to mail destined for the virtual domains specified
in the map
.Ar map .
For an example of how to configure a virtual map, see
.Xr makemap 8 .
.El
.Pp
Finally, the method of delivery is specified:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic deliver to maildir Ar path
Mail is added to a maildir.
Its location,
.Ar path ,
may contain format specifiers that are expanded before use
(see above).
If
.Ar path
is not provided, then
.Pa ~/Maildir
is assumed.
.It Ic deliver to mbox
Mail is delivered to the local user's system mailbox in
.Pa /var/mail .
.It Ic deliver to mda Ar program
Mail is piped to the specified
.Ar program ,
which is run with the privileges of the user the message is destined to.
This parameter may use conversion specifiers that are expanded before use
(see above).
.It Xo
.Ic relay
.Op Ic as Ar address
.Xc
Mail is relayed.
The routing decision is based on the DNS system.
.Pp
If
.Ic as
parameter is specified, then smtpd will rewrite the sender advertised
in the SMTP session.
.Ar address
may be a user, a domain prefixed with @ or an email address, causing
smtpd to rewrite the user-part, the domain-part or the entire address
respectively.
.It Xo
.Ic relay via
.Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ic tls | smtps | ssl
.Op Ic certificate Ar name
.Op Ic auth Ar map
.Op Ic as Ar address
.Xc
Mail is relayed through the specified
.Ar host
and
.Ar port .
.Pp
The communication channel may be secured using the
.Ic tls
or
.Ic smtps
options.
The special keyword
.Ic ssl
means that any of the two is acceptable:
SMTPS is tried first, STARTTLS second.
If a certificate
.Ar name
is specified and exists in the
.Pa /etc/mail/certs
directory with a .crt extension, it will be used if the remote server
requests a client certificate.
Creation of certificates is documented in
.Xr starttls 8 .
.Pp
If an SMTPAUTH session with
.Ar host
is desired, use the
.Ic auth
parameter to specify the
.Ar map
that holds the credentials.
.Pp
If
.Ic as
parameter is specified, then smtpd will rewrite the sender advertised
in the SMTP session.
.Ar address
may be a user, a domain prefixed with @ or an email address, causing
smtpd to rewrite the user-part, the domain-part or the entire address
respectively.
.It Ic expire Ar n {s|m|h|d}
Specify how long a message that matched this rule can stay in the queue.
.El
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/mail/smtpd.confXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/mail/smtpd.conf
Default
.Xr smtpd 8
configuration file.
.It Pa /var/spool/smtpd/
Spool directories for mail during processing.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The default
.Nm
file which ships with
.Ox
listens on the loopback network interface (lo0),
and allows for mail from users and daemons on the local machine,
as well as permitting email to remote servers.
Some more complex configurations are given below.
.Pp
This first example is the same as the default configuration,
but all outgoing mail is forwarded to a remote SMTP server.
A secrets file is needed to specify a username and password:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# touch /etc/mail/secrets
# chmod 640 /etc/mail/secrets
# chown root:_smtpd /etc/mail/secrets
# echo "smtp.example.com  username:password" \*(Gt /etc/mail/secrets
# makemap /etc/mail/secrets
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
would look like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listen on lo0
map aliases { source db "/etc/mail/aliases.db" }
map secrets { source db "/etc/mail/secrets.db" }
accept for local deliver to mbox
accept for all relay via smtp.example.com tls auth "secrets"
.Ed
.Pp
In this second example,
the aim is to permit mail relaying for any user that can authenticate
using their normal login credentials.
An RSA certificate must be provided to prove the server's identity.
The mail server has an external interface bnx0.
Mail with a local destination should be sent to an external mda.
First, the RSA certificate is created:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# openssl genrsa -out /etc/mail/certs/mail.example.com.key 4096
# openssl req -new -x509 -key /etc/mail/certs/mail.example.com.key \e
	-out /etc/mail/certs/mail.example.com.crt -days 365
# chmod 600 /etc/mail/certs/mail.example.com.*
.Ed
.Pp
In the example above,
a certificate valid for one year was created.
The configuration file would look like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listen on lo0
listen on bnx0 tls certificate "mail.example.com.crt" enable auth
map aliases { source db "/etc/mail/aliases.db" }
accept for local deliver to mda "/path/to/mda -f -"
accept from all for domain example.org deliver to mda "/path/to/mda -f -"
accept for all relay
