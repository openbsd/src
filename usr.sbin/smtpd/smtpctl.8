When
.Nm smtpd
receives a message, it generates a

for the message, and one
.Ar envelope-id
per recipient.
The
.Ar message-id
is a 32-bit random identifier that is guaranteed to be
unique on the host system.
The
.Ar envelope-id
is a 64-bit unique identifier that encodes the
.Ar message-id
in the 32 upper bits and a random envelope identifier
in the 32 lower bits.
.Pp
A command which specifies a
.Ar message-id
applies to all recipients of a message;
a command which specifies an
.Ar envelope-id
applies to a specific recipient of a message.
