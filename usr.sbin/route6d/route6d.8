.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a routing daemon which supports RIP over IPv6.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Xo Fl A
.Sm off
.Ar prefix No / Ar preflen
.No , Ar if1
.Op , Ar if2 , ...
.Sm on
.Xc
This option is used for aggregating routes.
.Ar prefix Ns / Ns Ar preflen
specifies the prefix and the prefix length of the
aggregated route.
When advertising routes,
.Nm
filters specific routes covered by the aggregate
and advertises the aggregated route
.Ar prefix Ns / Ns Ar preflen
to the interfaces specified in the comma-separated interface list
.Sm off
.Ar if1 Op , Ar if2 , ... .
.Sm on
.Nm
creates a static route to
.Ar prefix Ns / Ns Ar preflen ,
with the
.Dv RTF_REJECT
flag set, into the kernel routing table.
.It Fl a
Enables aging of the statically defined routes.
With this option, any
statically defined routes will be removed unless corresponding updates
arrive as if the routes are received at the startup of
.Nm .
.It Fl D
Enables extensive output of debugging messages.
This option also instructs
.Nm
to run in foreground mode
.Pq i.e. it does not become a daemon process .
.It Fl d
Enables output of debugging messages.
This option also instructs
.Nm
to run in foreground mode
.Pq i.e. it does not become a daemon process .
.It Fl h
Disables split horizon processing.
.It Xo Fl L
.Sm off
.Ar prefix No / Ar preflen
.No , Ar if1
.Op , Ar if2 , ...
.Sm on
.Xc
Filter incoming routes from interfaces
.Sm off
.Ar if1 Op , Ar if2 , ... .
.Sm on
.Nm
will accept incoming routes that are in
.Ar prefix Ns / Ns Ar preflen .
If multiple
.Fl L
options are specified, all routes that match any of the options are accepted.
.Li ::/0
is treated specially as the default route, not
.Do
any route that has longer prefix length than, or equal to, 0
.Dc .
For example, with
.Dq -L 3ffe::/16,if1 -L ::/0,if1 ,
.Nm
will accept the default route and routes in the 3ffe::/16 address range,
but no others.
To accept any route, simply do not specify the
.Fl L
option.
.It Fl l
By default,
.Nm
will not exchange site local routes for safety reasons.
This is because the semantics of site local address space are rather vague,
as the specification is still being worked on,
and there is no good way to define the site local boundary.
With
.Fl l ,
.Nm
will exchange site local routes as well.
It must not be used on site boundary routers,
since
.Fl l
assumes that all interfaces are in the same site.
.It Xo
.Fl N
.Sm off
.Ar if1
.Op , Ar if2 , ...
.Sm on
.Xc
Do not listen to, or advertise, route from/to interfaces specified by
.Sm off
.Ar if1 Op , Ar if2 , ... .
.Sm on
.It Fl n
Do not update the kernel routing table.
.It Xo Fl O
.Sm off
.Ar prefix No / Ar preflen
.No , Ar if1
.Op , Ar if2 , ...
.Sm on
.Xc
Restrict route advertisement toward interfaces specified by
.Sm off
.Ar if1 Op , Ar if2 , ... .
.Sm on
With this option
.Nm
will only advertise routes that match
.Ar prefix Ns / Ns Ar preflen .
.It Fl q
Makes
.Nm
use listen-only mode.
No advertisement is sent.
.It Fl R Ar routelog
This option makes
.Nm
log route changes (add/delete) to the file
.Ar routelog .
.It Fl S
This option is the same as
.Fl s ,
except that the split horizon rule does apply.
.It Fl s
Makes
.Nm
advertise the statically defined routes which exist in the kernel routing
table when
.Nm
is invoked.
Announcements obey the regular split horizon rule.
.It Xo
.Fl T
.Sm off
.Ar if1
.Op , Ar if2 , ...
.Sm on
.Xc
Advertise only the default route toward
.Sm off
.Ar if1 Op , Ar if2 , ... .
.Sm on
.It Fl t Ar tag
Attach the route tag
.Ar tag
to originated route entries.
.Ar tag
can be decimal, octal prefixed by
.Li 0 ,
or hexadecimal prefixed by
.Li 0x .
.El
.Pp
Upon receipt of signal
.Dv SIGINT
or
.Dv SIGUSR1 ,
.Nm
will dump the current internal state into
.Pa /var/run/route6d_dump .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/route6d_dump -compact
.It Pa /var/run/route6d_dump
Contains the internal state dumps created if
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGINT
or
.Dv SIGUSR1
signal.

.Sh NOTES
.Nm
uses the advanced IPv6 API,
defined in RFC 2292,
for communicating with peers using link-local addresses.
.Pp
Internally
.Nm
embeds interface identifiers into bits 32 to 63 of link-local addresses
.Po
.Li fe80::xx
and
.Li ff02::xx
.Pc
so they will be visible in the internal state dump file
.Pq Pa /var/run/route6d_dump .
.Pp
Routing table manipulation differs from IPv6 implementation to implementation.
Currently
.Nm
obeys the WIDE Hydrangea/KAME IPv6 kernel,
and will not be able to run on other platforms.
.Pp
Currently,
.Nm
does not reduce the rate of the triggered updates when consecutive updates
arrive.
