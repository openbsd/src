.Sh CBQ Commands
CBQ (Class Based Queueing) achieves both partitioning and sharing of
link bandwidth  by hierarchically structured classes.
Each class has its own queue and is assigned its share of bandwidth.
A child class can borrow bandwidth from its parent class as long as
excess bandwidth is available.

.Sy cbq-wrr
(weighted-round robin) or
.Sy cbq-prr
(packet-by-packet round robin).
.Sy cbq
is equivalent to
.Sy cbq-wrr .
.It Sy efficient
Enables CBQ's link efficiency mode.  This means that
the scheduler will send a packet from the first overlimit
class it encounters of all classes of the link-sharing
structure when all classes are overlimit.
This will also cause the scheduler to use greater than it's assigned
bandwidth, if the link is capable of more than the assigned bandwidth.
By default, this mode is turned off.  By adding the keyword
.Sy efficient
to the interface specification line, enables this mode.

.Pp
The
.Sy class
command specifies a CBQ class.
The classes are organized as a hierarchy, and every class, except
for the root class, has a parent.
.Bl -tag -width 8n -offset indent
.It Em sched_type
must be
.Sy cbq
for a CBQ class.
.It Em if_name
Interface name. Must correspond to name in interface specification.
.It Em class_name
Arbitrary name for this class.  Must be unique within the class
hierarchy for this interface.  The name
.Sy ctl_class
is a reserved class name.
.It Em parent_name
The name of the parent class for this class or
.Sy NULL
if this is the root class.  Parent class must have been previously defined.
.It Sy admission
The type of admission control and QoS type.
.Sy cntlload
is controlled load service for
.Em RSVP ,
otherwise, it should be
.Sy none .
The default is
.Sy none .
.It Sy priority
High numbers are higher priority.  Max value is 7 and Min value is 0.
Default is 1.
.It Sy pbandwidth
The percentage of the interface bandwidth allocated to this class.
Generally should add up to 100 percent at each level of the class
hierarchy, although other amounts can be specified for purposes of
experimentation.
.It Sy exactbandwidth
Specify the bandwidth in bits-per-second instead of
.Sy pbandwidth .
Note that the bandwidth allocation of CBQ is not so precise but this
is just a way to pass a parameter to CBQ; the user is supposed to know
the detailed internals of CBQ.
.Sy pbandwidth
is a preferred way to specify the bandwidth of a class.
.It Sy borrow
The class can borrow bandwidth from its parent class when this class
is overlimit.
If this keyword is not present, then no borrowing is done, and the
packet is delayed or dropped when the class is overlimit.
.It Sy default
Specify the default class.  When this keyword is present, all packets
that do not match some classification criteria are assigned to this
class.  Must be exactly one class on each interface defined as the
default class.
.It Sy control
Specify the control class.  When this keyword is present, the predefined
control class packets (RSVP, IGMP, and ICMP) are assigned to this
class.
Note that when the control class is not specified by the time the
default class is created, one is automatically created with default
parameters.  Thus, if the control class is specified, it must be
listed before the default class.
Must be exactly one class on each interface defined as the
control class.
.It Sy maxburst
The maximum burst of back-to-back packets allowed in this class.
Default is 16 but the default value is automatically reduced to 4 when
the class bandwidth is small (about less than 1Mbps).
.It Sy minburst
The minimum burst is used to obtain the steady state burst size.  It's
the parameter to help compute offtime for the class.  Offtime is the
amount of time a class is to wait between packets. Default is 2.
.It Sy maxdelay
The maxdelay is specified in millisecond and used to obtain the max
queue size of the class.
If not specified, the default max queue size (30 packets) is used.
.It Sy packetsize
The average packet size in bytes to be used in CBQ over-/under-limit
computations.  Default value is MTU of the interface.
.It Sy maxpacketsize
The maxium packet size in bytes for the class.
Default value is MTU of the interface.
.It Sy red
enables RED on this class queue.
.It Sy rio
enables RIO on this class queue.
.It Sy ecn
enables RED/ECN on this class queue.
.It Sy flowvalve
enables RED/flow-valve (a.k.a. red-penalty-box) on this class queue.
.It Sy cleardscp
clears diffserv codepoint in the IP header.
.El
.Pp
.Sh HFSC Commands
HFSC (Hierarchical Fair Service Curve) supports both link-sharing and
guaranteed real-time services.  H-FSC employs a service curve based QoS
model, and its unique feature is an ability to decouple delay and
bandwidth allocation.
HFSC has 2 independent scheduling mechanisms.
Real-time scheduling is used to guarantee the delay and the
bandwidth allocation at the same time.
Hierarchical link-sharing is used to distribute the excess
bandwidth.
When dequeueing a packet, HFSC always tries real-time scheduling
first.  If no packet is eligible for real-time scheduling,
link-sharing scheduling is performed.
HFSC does not use class hierarchy for real-time scheduling.

should be either
.Sy sc, rt
or
.Sy ls .
.Sy sc
(service curve) is used to set the same values to both service curves.
.Sy rt
(real-time) is used to specify the real-time service curve.
.Sy ls
(link-sharing) is used to specify the link-sharing service curve.
.Em m1
is the slope of the first segment specified in bits-per-second.

.Sh RIO Commands
ALTQ/RIO has 3 drop precedence levels defined for the Assured
Forwarding of DiffServ (RFC2597).
Since adaptive flows are likely to stay under
the medium drop precedence level under congestion, the medium drop
precedence would protect adaptive flows from unadaptive flows.
.Pp
The original RIO has 2 sets of RED parameters; one for in-profile
packets and the other for out-of-profile packets.
At the ingress of the network, profile meters tag packets as IN
or OUT based on contracted profiles for customers.
Inside the network, IN packets receive preferential treatment by
the RIO dropper.
It is possible to provision the network not to drop IN packets
at all by providing enough capacity for the total volume of IN
packets.
Thus, RIO can be used to provide a service that statistically assures
capacity allocated for users.
This mechanism can be extended to support an arbitrary number of drop
precedence levels.  ALTQ supports 3 drop precedence levels.

.Sh CDNR Commands
The
.Sy conditioner
command specifies a diffserv traffic conditioner.  A traffic
conditioner is not a queueing discipline but a component to meter,
mark or drop incoming packets according to some rules.
.Pp
As opposed to a queueing discipline, a traffic conditioner handles
incoming packets at an input interface.
If no queueing discipline (e.g., CBQ) is used for the interface,
a null interface command should be used to specify an input network
interface.

.It Sy tbmeter
is a token bucket meter configured with rate and depth parameters.
Rate is token rate in bits-per-second.  Depth is bucket depth in KB.
When an incoming packet is in profile (available token is more than
the packet size), tbmeter takes in_action.
Otherwise, tbmeter takes out_action.

.It Sy trtcm
is a 2-rate 3 color marker for Assured Forwarding.
A trtcm consists of 2 token buckets, one for a committed rate and the
other for a peak rate.
When an incoming packet is in the committed profile, trtcm takes
green_action.  When the packet is out of the committed profile but in
the peak profile, trtcm takes yellow_action.  Otherwise, tbtcm takes
red_action.
A trtcm is either color-aware or color-blind.  A color-aware trtcm do
not raise the color (ds field value), that is, a yellow packet can be
yellow or red but can not be blue.  Default is color-blind.

.It Sy tswtcm
is a time sliding window 3 color marker for Assured Forwarding.
A tswtcm differs from trtcm in that a tswtcm probabilistically marks
packets.
A tswtcm consists of 2 rates, one for a committed rate and the
other for a peak rate.
When an incoming packet is in the committed profile, tswtcm takes
green_action.  When the packet is out of the committed profile but in
the peak profile, tswtcm takes yellow_action.  Otherwise, tswtcm takes
red_action.
cmtd_rate and peak_rate are specified in bits per seccond.
avg_interval provides the size of time window for averaging incoming
rate, and is specified in milli-second.  500 msec is ok for normal
settings.
