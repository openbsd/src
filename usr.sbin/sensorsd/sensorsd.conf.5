.Sh NAME
.Nm sensorsd.conf
.Nd configuration file for sensorsd
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sensorsd.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is read by
.Xr sensorsd 8
to configure hardware sensor monitoring.
Each valid sensor registered in the system
is matched by at most one entry in
.Nm ,
which may specify high and low limits,
and whether sensor status changes provided by driver should be ignored.
If the limits are crossed or if status provided by the driver changes,
.Xr sensorsd 8 's
alert functionality is triggered and a command, if specified, is
executed.
.Pp
.Nm
follows the syntax of configuration databases as documented in
.Xr getcap 3 .
Complete
.Va hw.sensors
.Xr sysctl 8
variable names are used to find entries,
with a fallback to sensor types.
For example, if an entry with a full name of a certain temperature
sensor is not present in
.Nm ,
then an entry
.Va temp
will be looked at to determine the settings.
The following attributes may be used:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "commandXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Li command
Specify a command to be executed if limits are crossed.
.It Li high
Specify an upper limit.
.It Li low
Specify a lower limit.
.It Li istatus
Specify to ignore status provided by the driver.
.El
.Pp
The values for temperature sensors can be given in degrees Celsius or
Fahrenheit, for voltage sensors in volts, and fan speed sensors take a
unit-less number representing RPM.
.Pp
Sensors that provide status (such as from
.Xr bio 4 ,
.Xr esm 4 ,
or
.Xr ipmi 4 )
do not require boundary values specified (that otherwise will be
ignored) and simply trigger on status transitions.
.Pp
The command is executed on transitions out of, and back into, given limits.
Tokens in the command are substituted as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It %x
the xname of the device the sensor sits on
.It %t
the type of sensor
.It %n
the sensor number
.It %2
the sensor's current value
.It %3
the sensor's low limit
.It %4
the sensor's high limit
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Xr sensorsd 8
monitors status changes on all sensors that keep their state.
This behaviour may be altered by using the
.Dq istatus
attribute,
for example, you may specify to ignore status changes of sensors with
certain type, or of any individual sensors.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/sensorsd.conf"
.It /etc/sensorsd.conf
Configuration file for
.Xr sensorsd 8 .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In the following configuration file,
if hw.sensors.ipmi0.temp0 goes above 80C, the command
.Pa /etc/sensorsd/log_warning
will be executed,
with the sensor type, number and current value passed to it.
Alerts will be sent if hw.sensors.ipmi0.temp1 goes above 170F;
if hw.sensors.lm0.volt3 goes below 4.8V or above 5.2V;
if the speed of the fan attached to hw.sensors.lm0.fan1
goes below 1000RPM or above 8000RPM;
if any RAID volume drive
goes into a state other than
.Dq OK ,
such as drive failure, rebuild, or a complete failure, the command
.Pa /etc/sensorsd/drive
will be executed, with the sensor number passed to it; however,
no alerts will be generated for status changes on timedelta sensors.
For all other sensors whose drivers automatically provide
sensor status updates, alerts will be generated 
each time those sensors undergo status transitions.
