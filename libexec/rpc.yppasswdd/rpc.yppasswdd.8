.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm rpc.yppasswdd
must be running on the YP master server to allow users to change information
in the password file.
If the user needs to change his password this is
normally done with a program called
.Nm yppasswd .
This program doesn't exist in
.Ox
but is integrated into
.Xr passwd 1 .
.Nm passwd
will automatically determine which password database should be modified.
To force a change of a YP password when a local one also exists, use
.Nm passwd -y .
.Pp
Other user information can be changed with
.Xr chpass 1 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar directory
Use the specified directory to get at the password-related files instead
of
.Pa /etc .
.It Fl noshell
Don't allow changes of the shell field in the passwd file.
.It Fl nogecos
Don't allow changes of the gecos field in the passwd file.
.It Fl nopw
Don't allow changes of the password in the passwd file.
.It Fl m Ar arg1 arg2 ...
