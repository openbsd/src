.Sh NAME
.Nm smtpd
.Nd
Obtuse Systems SMTPD message storing daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm smtpd
.Op Fl HPDL
.Op Fl c Ar chrootdir
.Op Fl d Ar spooldir
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl m Ar myname
.Op Fl s Ar maxsize
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nmsmtpd
daemon talks the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) with
other SMTP daemons to receive mail from them, and saves it into a spool
directory for later processing. It is the store portion of an SMTP
store and forward proxy. The symbiotic companion program smtpfwdd is
used to forward the spooled mail on to its eventual destination.
smtpd is normally invoked from a super-server such as 
.Xr inetd 8 . 
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Specify a different 
.Ar chrootdir
directory to chroot into on startup. The default is 
.Pa /var/spool/smtpd.  
This directory should be readable and writable only to the user that
smtpd runs as.
.It Fl d
Specify a different spool
.Ar directory
within the crooted subtree. The default is ".", making smtpd spool
files to the directory it chroots itself to.
.It Fl D
Tells smtpd to run as a daemon, listening on port 25. The
default is not to run as a daemon
.It Fl g 
Specify a 
.Ar group 
to run as. Same as user above.
.It Fl H
Disable host checking against the DNS. By default smtpd checks
and will complain in the syslogs if the DNS information on a host
seems to indicate a possible spoof or misconfiguration.
.It Fl L
Suppress children in daemon mode (above) from doing an
openlog() call. This means your syslogs won't have pid
information, but is useful if you don't want to have to set up
your chroot jail for smtpd in a manner that an openlog() call will
work in it.
.It Fl m
Specify
.Ar myname ,
the hostname the daemon should announce itself
as. the default is whatever gethostname() returns.
.It Fl P
Enable paranoid mode of operation, in this mode connections are
dropped from any client feeding smtpd a suspicious hostname,
FROM:, or RCPT: line containing characters indicative of an
attempt to do something evil, or any message headers that aren't
8bit clean. The default is to log such occuurances and substitute
for the offending characters, but not drop the connection.
.It Fl s
Specify 
.Ar maxsize
the maximum size (in bytes) of mail message the
daemon should accept. The default is not to have a maximum size.
.It Fl u
Specify a 
.Ar user 
to run as. This user must not be root but
should be a user that is able to run sendmail and use the
-f option to specify the sender of a mail message.
.Sh FILES
The address checking file is normally 
.Pa etc/smtpd_check_rules ,
within the chroot directory.
.Pp
The address check file, when enabled is read for each RCPT line in the
SMTP dialogue. Each rule is checked with the current  source (SMTP
client machine and possibly user from ident) and the current FROM: and
RCPT: addresses. 
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr smtpfwdd 8 ,
.Xr sendmail 8 ,
.Xr inetd 8

for examples and rules file details.
.Sh BUGS
Mistakes in
.Pa /etc/smtpd_check_rules 
can discard legitimate mail and annoy
your users and other postmasters a very great deal!. When
combined with custom return codes it is possible to write rules
that completely break the smtp protocol. It is important to test
your rules out and be absolutely sure they do exactly what you
want and no more.
.Pp
If 
.Xr sendmail 8
is not run as a daemon when using smtpd and
smtpfwdd, one must use cron to periodically invoke sendmail -q so that
queued messages are retried for eventual delivery. Alternatively sendmail
may be run as a daemon but not listening to the network.
