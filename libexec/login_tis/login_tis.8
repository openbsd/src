.Sh NAME
.Nm login_tis
.Nd provide TIS Firewall Toolkit authentication type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login_tis
.Op Fl s Ar service
.Op Fl v Ar fd=number
.Ar user
.Op Ar class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is called by
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr su 1 ,
.Xr ftpd 8 ,
and others to authenticate the
.Ar user
via the
.Tn TIS
.Dq Firewall Toolkit
authentication server
.Pq Em authsrv ,
optionally using
.Tn DES
encryption.
.Pp
The
.Ar service
argument specifies which protocol to use with the
invoking program.
The allowed protocols are
.Em login ,
.Em challenge ,
and
.Em response .
The default protocol is
.Em login .
.Pp
The
.Ar fd
argument is used to specify the number of an open file descriptor
connected to
.Em authsrv .
This allows a persistent connection to be used for separate
.Em challenge
and
.Em response
authentication.
.Pp
The
.Ar user
argument is the login name of the user to be authenticated.
.Pp
The
.Ar class
argument is the login class of the user to be authenticated
and is used to look up
.Pa /etc/login.conf
variables (see below).
It is also sent to
.Em authsrv
for logging purposes.
If no
.Ar class
argument is specified, the class will be obtained from the password database.
.Pp
.Nm
will connect to
.Em authsrv
and, depending on the desired protocol,
will do one of three things:
.Bl -tag -width challenge
.It login
Present
.Ar user
with a challenge, accept a response and report back to the
invoking program whether or not the authentication was successful.
.It challenge
Return a challenge for
.Ar user
if the user's entry in
.Em authsrv
specifies a challenge/response style of authentication.
.It response
Send a response to
.Em authsrv
and report back to the invoking program whether or not the server accepted it.
.El
.Sh LOGIN.CONF VARIABLES
The
.Nm
utility uses the following TIS-specific
.Pa /etc/login.conf
variables:
.Bl -tag -width tis-server-alt
.It tis-keyfile
Path to a file containing a
.Tn DES
key string to be used for encrypting communications end to end with
.Em authsrv .
This file must not be readable or writable by users other than root.
If no
.Ar tis-keyfile
is specified, communication with
.Em authsrv
will be sent in clear text.
.It tis-port
Symbolic name listed in
.Xr services 5
or port number on which
.Em authsrv
listens.
Defaults to port 7777.
.It tis-server
Hostname or IP address of the
.Tn TIS
.Em authsrv
daemon to connect to.
Defaults to
.Dq localhost .
.It tis-server-alt
Alternate server to use when the primary is not reachable.
.It tis-timeout
Number of seconds to wait for a response from
.Em authsrv .
Defaults to 15 seconds.
