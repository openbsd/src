.Dt LOGIN_KRB5-OR-PWD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm login_krb5-or-pwd
.Nd provide KerberosV or password authentication type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login_krb5-or-pwd
.Op Fl s Ar service
.Op Fl v Ar arguments
.Ar user
.Op Ar class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program first attempts to authenticate the user via KerberosV and,
failing that, falls back to standard password authentication.
.Pp
If KerberosV is not configured on the system,
.Nm
is equivalent to calling
.Xr login_passwd 8 .
When root tries to login,
.Nm
skips KerberosV authentication, as this may give problems in case of a
network failure.
.Pp
The
.Ar user
argument is the user's name to be authenticated.
.Pp
The
.Ar service
argument specifies which protocol to use with the
invoking program.
The allowed protocols are
.Em login ,
.Em challenge ,
and
.Em response .
(The
.Em challenge
protocol is silently ignored but will report success as KerberosV
authentication is not challenge-response based).
.Pp
The arguments following
.Fl v
are the same as for
.Xr login_krb5 8
and
.Xr login_passwd 8 .
Unknown arguments are ignored.
.Pp
.Nm
will prompt the user for a password and report back to the
invoking program whether or not the authentication was
successful.
