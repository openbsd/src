.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm login_radius
.Nd contact radiusd for authentication
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login_radius
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl s Ar service
.Op Fl v Ar name=value
.Ar user
.Op Ar class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility contacts the
.Xr radiusd
daemon to authenticate a
.Ar user .
If no
.Ar class
is specified, the login class will be obtained from the password database.
.Pp
When executed as the name
.Pa login_ Ns Ar style ,
.Nm
will request
.Xr radiusd
use the authentication specified by
.Ar style .
.Pp
Available options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Debug mode.
Output is sent to the standard output instead of the BSD
authentication backchannel.
.It Fl s
Specify the service.
Currently only
.Li challenge ,
.Li login ,
and
.Li response
are supported.
.It Fl v
This option and its value are ignored.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility needs to know a shared secret for each radius server it talks to.
Shared secrets are stored in the file
.Pa /etc/raddb/servers
with the format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
server shared_secret
.Ed
.Pp
It is expected that rather than requesting the radius style directly
(in which case the
.Xr radiusd
server uses a default style)
that
.Nm
will be linked to the various mechanisms desired.
For instance, to have all CRYPTOCard and ActivCard authentication take
place on a remote server via the radius protocol, remove the
.Pa login_activ
and
.Pa login_crypto
modules and link
.Pa login_radius
to both of those names.
Now when the user requests one of those authentication styles,
.Nm
will automatically forward the request to the remote
.Xr radiusd
and request it do the requested style of authentication.
.Sh LOGIN.CONF VARIABLES
The
.Nm
utility uses the following radius-specific
.Pa /etc/login.conf
variables:
.Bl -tag -width radius-challenge-styles
.It radius-port
Port name or number to connect to on the radius server.
.It radius-server
Hostname of the radius server to contact.
.It radius-server-alt
Alternate radius server to use when the primary is not responding.
.It radius-challenge-styles
Comma-separated list of authentication styles that the radius server
knows about.
If the user's authentication style is in this list the challenge will
be provided by the radius server.
If not,
.Nm
will prompt the user for the password before sending the request
(along with the password) to the radius server.
.It radius-timeout
Number of seconds to wait for a response from the radius server.
Defaults to 2 seconds.
.It radius-retries
Number of times to attempt to contact the radius server before giving up
(or falling back to the alternate server if there is one).
Defaults to 6 tries.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -compact -width xetcxraddbxserversxx
.It Pa /etc/login.conf
login configuration database
.It Pa /etc/raddb/servers
list of radius servers and their associated shared secrets
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr login.conf 5
.Sh CAVEATS
.Ox
does not ship with a radius server in the default install, however
several are available via
.Xr packages 7 .
.Pp
For
.Nm
to function, the
.Pa /etc/raddb
directory must be owned by group
.Dq _radius
and have group-execute permissions.
Likewise, the
.Pa /etc/raddb/servers
file must be readable by group
.Dq _radius .
