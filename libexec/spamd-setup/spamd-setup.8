.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm spamd-setup
.Nd parse and load file of spammer addresses
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm spamd-setup
.Op Fl dn
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility adds blacklists by adding addresses to the
.Xr pf 4
table
.Em <spamd> ,
as well as configuring mail rejection messages for
the added list of addresses in
.Xr spamd 8 .
The
.Em spamd
table is used in conjunction with a
.Xr pf 4
redirection rule to selectively redirect mail connections
to the
.Xr spamd 8
daemon.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Debug mode reports a few pieces of information.
.It Fl n
Dry-run mode.
No data is shipped to
.Xr pf 4 .
.El
.Pp
Blacklists and whitelists are specified in the configuration file
.Pa /etc/spamd.conf
and are processed in the order specified in the
.Ar all
tag.
Output is concatenated to build up a table for
.Xr pf 4 .
Then the blacklist addresses are sent to a running
.Xr spamd 8
along with the message spamd will give on mail rejection when a
matching client connects.
The configuration port for
.Xr spamd 8
is found from
.Xr services 5 ,
by looking for the named service
.Em spamd-cfg .
.Pp
.Nm
reads all configuration information from a
.Xr spamd.conf 5
file.
