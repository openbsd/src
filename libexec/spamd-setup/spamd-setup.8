The

utility adds blacklists by adding addresses to the
.Xr pf 4
table
.Aq spamd ,
as well as configuring mail rejection messages for
the added list of addresses in
.Xr spamd 8 .
The
.Aq spamd
table is used in conjuction with a
.Xr pf 4
redirection rule to selectively redirect mail connections
to the
.Xr spamd 8
daemon.
.Pp
blacklists and whitelists are specified in the configuration file
.Pa /etc/spamd.conf
and are processed in the order specified in the 
.Ar all
tag. 
output is concatenated to build up a table for
.Xr pf 4 .
Then the blacklist addresses are sent to a running
.Xr spamd 8
along with the message spamd will give on mail rejection when a
matching client connects.
.Pp
.Nm
reads all configuration information from a 
.Xr spamd.conf 5
file.
