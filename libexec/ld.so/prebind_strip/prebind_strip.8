.Sh DESCRIPTION

.Xr prebind 8
.Sh STANDARDS
None
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Ox 4.0 .
.Nm
is based loosely on Prelinking, however prelink removes the security
feature of libraries appearing in random order on each invocation, thus
it was incompatible with
.Ox Ns 's
goals.
.Nm
was written as an attempt to improve the speed of dynamic linking
without the penalty of loss of security features.
