.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm prebind
.Nd cache symbol lookup information to speed up dynamic linking.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm prebind
.Op Fl mv
.Op Ar file/dir ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Parse each of the specified files or directories and process each ELF file
(ELF file found in the directory) and the associated DT_NEEDED libraries
and write symbol resolution hint information to each binary and library.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m
Merge the results of this prebind cache with the prebind information
previously on any libraries referenced.
.It Fl v
Be verbose when running prebind, prints out information about
the file/library that is bein processed.
.Pp
.Sh BUGS and CAVEATS
Prebind uses a lot of memory depending on how many files/libraries
are being processed. 
Handling of binaries where a required library has been removed is poor.
.Sh SEE AlSO
.Xr ld.so 1
.Xr prebind_strip 1
.Sh STANDARDS
None
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility first appeared in OpenBSD 4.0.
.Nm
is based loosely on Prelinking, however prelink removes the security
feature of libraries appearing a random order on each invocation, thus
it was incompatible with OpenBSD's Goals.
.Nm
was written as attempt to improve the speed of dynamic linking
without the penalty of loss of security features.
