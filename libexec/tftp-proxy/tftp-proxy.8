.Sh NAME
.Nm tftp-proxy
.Nd Internet Trivial File Transfer Protocol proxy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tftp-proxy
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl w Ar transwait
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a proxy for the Internet Trivial File Transfer Protocol invoked by
the
.Xr inetd 8
internet server.
TFTP connections should be redirected to the proxy using a
.Xr pf 4
rule using the
.Ar divert-to
option, after which the proxy connects to the server on behalf of
the client.
The connection from the proxy to the server needs to be passed by
a rule with divert-reply set.
.Pp
The proxy inserts
.Xr pf 4
pass rules using the
.Ar anchor
facility to allow payload packets between the client and the server.
Once the rules are inserted,
.Nm
forwards the initial request from the client to the server to begin the
transfer.
After
.Ar transwait
seconds, the states are assumed to have been established and the
.Xr pf 4
rules are deleted and the program exits.
Once the transfer between the client and the server is completed the
states will naturally expire.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Log the connection and request information to
.Xr syslogd 8 .
.It Fl w Ar transwait
Number of seconds to wait for the data transmission to begin before
removing the
.Xr pf 4
rule.
The default is 2 seconds.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
To make use of the proxy,
.Xr pf.conf 5
needs the following rules.
The anchor is mandatory.
Adjust the rule as needed for your configuration.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
anchor "tftp-proxy/*"
pass in quick on $int_if inet proto udp from $lan to port tftp \e
    divert-to 127.0.0.1 port 6969
pass out quick on $ext_if inet proto udp from $lan to port tftp \e
    group proxy divert-reply
.Ed
.Pp
.Xr inetd 8
must be configured to spawn the proxy on the port that packets are
being forwarded to by
.Xr pf 4 .
An example
.Xr inetd.conf 5
entry follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
127.0.0.1:6969	dgram	udp	wait	root:proxy \e
	/usr/libexec/tftp-proxy	tftp-proxy
