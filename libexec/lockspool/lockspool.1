or

is received.
Additionally, the superuser may specify the name of a user in order
to lock a different mailbox.

is able to create the lock file,
.Dq 1
is written to stdout, otherwise

is written and an error message is written to stderr.

for a short period in between tries).

utility exits 0 on success, and 1 if an error occurs.
