.Sh NAME
.Nm df
.Nd display free disk space
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hiklnP
.Op Fl t Ar type
.Op Ar file | Ar file_system ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the specified
.Ar file_system
or on the file system of which
.Ar file
is a part.
Values are displayed in 512-byte per block block counts.
If neither a file nor a
.Ar file_system
operand is specified,
statistics for all mounted file systems are displayed
(subject to the
.Fl l
and
.Fl t
options below).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
"Human-readable" output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, Exabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to four or less.
.It Fl i
Include statistics on the number of free inodes.
.It Fl k
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
The
.Fl k
option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
.It Fl l
Display statistics only about mounted file systems with the MNT_LOCAL
flag set. If a non-local file system is given as an argument, a
warning is issued and no information is given on that file system. 
.It Fl n
Print out the previously obtained statistics from the file systems.
This option should be used if it is possible that one or more
file systems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
statistics without a long delay.
When this option is specified,
.Nm
will not request new statistics from the file systems, but will respond
with the possibly stale statistics that were previously obtained.
.It Fl P
Print out information in a stricter format designed to be parsed
by portable scripts.
.It Fl t Ar type
Indicate the actions should only be taken on
filesystems of the specified
.Ar type .
More than one type may be specified in a comma separated list.
The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
.Dq no
to specify the filesystem types for which action should
.Em not
be taken. If a file system is given on the command line that is not of
the specified type, a warning is issued and no information is given on
that file system.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environment variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl k
option is not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of that
size block.
