.Sh NAME
.Nm rmd160
.Nd calculate a message-digest fingerprint (checksum) for a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rmd160
.Oo
.Fl p | Fl t | Fl x |
.Fl s Ar string |
.Fl c Ar [ file ... ] |
.Ar file ...
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces
as output a 160-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.
It is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce
two messages having the same message digest, or to produce any
message having a given prespecified target message digest.
.Pp
The
.Em RMD-160
algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a
large file must be "compressed" in a secure manner before being
encrypted with a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem
such as
.Em RSA .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s Ar string
Prints a checksum of the given
.Ar string .
.It Fl c Ar [ file ... ]
Compares all checksums in the
.Ar file
with new computed checksums for the files mentioned in the
.Ar file .
Output consists of which digest was used, the file name,
and an OK or FAILED for the result of the comparison.  This will
validate any of the supported checksums in the
.Ar file
including MD5 and SHA-1.  If no file is given, stdin is used.
.It Fl p
Echos stdin to stdout and appends the
.Em RMD-160
sum to stdout.
.It Fl t
Runs a built-in time trial.
.It Fl x
Runs a built-in test script.
.El
.Pp
The RMD-160 sum of each file listed on the command line is printed after
the options are processed.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cksum 1 ,
.Xr md5 1 ,
.Xr sha1 1
.Pp
RMD-160 is part of the ISO draft standard
.Qq ISO/IEC DIS 10118-3
on dedicated hash functions.
