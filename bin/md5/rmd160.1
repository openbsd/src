.Sh NAME
.Nm rmd160
.Nd calculate a message-digest fingerprint (checksum) for a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rmd160
.Op Fl ptx
.Op Fl s Ar string
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces
as output a 160-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.
It is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce
two messages having the same message digest, or to produce any
message having a given prespecified target message digest.
.Pp
The
.Em RMD-160
algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a
large file must be "compressed" in a secure manner before being
encrypted with a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem
such as
.Em RSA .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl s Ar string
Prints a checksum of the given
.Ar string .
.It Fl p
Echos stdin to stdout and appends the
.Em RMD-160
sum to stdout.
.It Fl t
Runs a built-in time trial.
.It Fl x
Runs a built-in test script.
.El
.Pp
The RMD-160
sum of each file listed on the command line is printed after the options
are processed.

RMD-160 is part of the ISO draft standard
.St "ISO/IEC DIS 10118-3"
on dedicated hash functions.

This program is placed in the public domain for free general use by
RSA Data Security.
