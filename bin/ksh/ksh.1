.\"{{{  Description
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBksh\fP is a command interpreter that is intended for both 
interactive and shell script use.  Its command language is a superset
of the \fIsh\fP(1) shell language.
.\"{{{  Shell Startup
.SS "Shell Startup"
The following options can be specified only on the command line:
.IP "\fB\-c\fP \fIcommand-string\fP"
the shell executes the command(s) contained in \fIcommand-string\fP
.IP \fB\-i\fP
interactive mode \(em see below
.IP \fB\-l\fP
login shell \(em see below
interactive mode \(em see below
.IP \fB\-s\fP
the shell reads commands from standard input; all non-option arguments
are positional parameters
.IP \fB\-r\fP
restricted mode \(em see below
.PP
In addition to the above, the options described in the \fBset\fP built-in
command can also be used on the command line.
.PP
If neither the \fB\-c\fP nor the \fB\-s\fP options are specified, the
first non-option argument specifies the name of a file the shell reads
commands from; if there are no non-option arguments, the shell reads
commands from standard input.
The name of the shell (\fIi.e.\fP, the contents of the \fB$0\fP) parameter
is determined as follows: if the \fB\-c\fP option is used and there is
a non-option argument, it is used as the name; if commands are being
read from a file, the file is used as the name; otherwise the name
the shell was called with (\fIi.e.\fP, argv[0]) is used.
.PP
A shell is \fBinteractive\fP if the \fB\-i\fP option is used or
if both standard input and standard error are attached to a tty.
An interactive shell has job control enabled (if available),
ignores the INT, QUIT and TERM signals, and prints prompts before
reading input (see \fBPS1\fP and \fBPS2\fP parameters).
For non-interactive shells, the \fBtrackall\fP option is on by default
(see \fBset\fP command below).
.PP
A shell is \fBrestricted\fP if the \fB\-r\fP option is used or if either
the basename of the name the shell is invoked with or the \fBSHELL\fP
parameter match the pattern *r*sh (\fIe.g.\fP, rsh, rksh, rpdksh, \fIetc.\fP).
The following restrictions come into effect after the shell processes
any profile and \fB$ENV\fP files:
.nr P2 \n(PD
.nr PD 0
.IP \ \ \(bu
the \fBcd\fP command is disabled
.IP \ \ \(bu
the \fBSHELL\fP, \fBENV\fP and \fBPATH\fP parameters can't be changed
.IP \ \ \(bu
command names can't be specified with absolute or relative paths
.IP \ \ \(bu
the \fB\-p\fP option of the \fBcommand\fP built-in can't be used
.IP \ \ \(bu
redirections that create files can't be used (\fIi.e.\fP, \fB>\fP,
\fB>|\fP, \fB>>\fP, \fB<>\fP)
.nr PD \n(P2
.PP
A shell is \fBprivileged\fP if the \fB\-p\fP option is used or if
the real user-id or group-id does not match the effective user-id
or group-id (see \fIgetuid\fP(2), \fIgetgid\fP(2)).
A privileged shell does not process $HOME/.profile nor the \fBENV\fP
parameter (see below), instead the file /etc/suid_profile is processed.
Clearing the privileged option causes the shell to set its effective
user-id (group-id) to its real user-id (group-id).
.PP
If the basename of the name the shell is called with (\fIi.e.\fP, argv[0])
starts with \fB\-\fP or if the \fB\-l\fP option is used, the shell is assumed
to be a login shell and the shell reads and executes the contents of
\fB/etc/profile\fP and \fB$HOME/.profile\fP if they exist and are readable.
.PP
If the \fBENV\fP parameter is set when the shell starts (or, in the
case of login shells, after any profiles are processed), its value
is subjected to parameter, command, arithmetic and tilde substitution and
the resulting file (if any) is read and executed.
If \fBENV\fP parameter is not set (and not null) and pdksh was compiled
with the \fBDEFAULT_ENV\fP macro defined, the file named in that macro
is included (after the above mentioned substitutions have been performed).
.PP
The exit status of the shell is 127 if the command file specified
on the command line could not be opened, or non-zero if a fatal syntax
error occurred during the execution of a script.
In the absence of fatal errors, the exit status is that of the last
command executed, or zero, if no command is executed.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  Command Syntax
.SS "Command Syntax"
.\"{{{  words and tokens
The shell begins parsing its input by breaking it into \fIword\fPs.
Words, which are sequences of characters, are delimited by unquoted
\fIwhite-space\fP characters (space, tab and newline) or \fImeta-characters\fP
(\fB<\fP, \fB>\fP, \fB|\fP, \fB;\fP, \fB&\fP, \fB(\fP and \fB)\fP).
Aside from delimiting words, spaces and tabs are ignored, while
newlines usually delimit commands.
The meta-characters are used in building the following tokens:
\fB<\fP, \fB<&\fP, \fB<<\fP, \fB>\fP, \fB>&\fP, \fB>>\fP, \fIetc.\fP are
used to specify redirections (see Input/Output Redirection below);
\fB|\fP is used to create pipelines;
\fB|&\fP is used to create co-processes (see Co-Processes below);
\fB;\fP is used to separate commands;
\fB&\fP is used to create asynchronous pipelines;
\fB&&\fP and \fB||\fP are used to specify conditional execution;
\fB;;\fP is used in \fBcase\fP statements;
\fB((\fP .. \fB))\fP are used in arithmetic expressions;
and lastly,
\fB(\fP .. \fB)\fP are used to create subshells.
.PP
White-space and meta-characters can be quoted individually using
backslash (\fB\e\fP), or in groups using double (\fB"\fP) or single (\fB'\fP)
quotes.
Note that the following characters are also treated specially by the shell and
must be quoted if they are to represent themselves:
\fB\e\fP, \fB"\fP, \fB'\fP, \fB#\fP, \fB$\fP, \fB`\fP, \fB~\fP, \fB{\fP,
\fB}\fP, \fB*\fP, \fB?\fP and \fB[\fP.
The first three of these are the above mentioned quoting characters
(see Quoting below);
\fB#\fP, if used at the beginning of a word, introduces a comment \(em everything
after the \fB#\fP up to the nearest newline is ignored;
\fB$\fP is used to introduce parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions
(see Substitution below);
\fB`\fP introduces an old-style command substitution
(see Substitution below);
\fB~\fP begins a directory expansion (see Tilde Expansion below);
\fB{\fP and \fB}\fP delimit \fIcsh\fP(1) style alternations
(see Brace Expansion below);
and, finally, \fB*\fP, \fB?\fP and \fB[\fP are used in file name generation
(see File Name Patterns below).
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  simple-command
.PP
As words and tokens are parsed, the shell builds commands, of which
there are two basic types: \fIsimple-commands\fP, typically programs
that are executed, and \fIcompound-commands\fP, such as \fBfor\fP and
\fBif\fP statements, grouping constructs and function definitions.
.PP
A simple-command consists of some combination of parameter assignments (see
Parameters below), input/output redirections (see Input/Output Redirections
below), and command words; the only restriction is that parameter assignments
come before any command words.
The command words, if any, define the command that is to be executed and its
arguments.
The command may be a shell built-in command, a function or an \fIexternal
command\fP, \fIi.e.\fP, a separate executable file that is located using the
\fBPATH\fP parameter (see Command Execution below).
Note that all command constructs have an \fIexit status\fP: for external
commands, this is related to the status returned by \fIwait\fP(2) (if the
command could not be found, the exit status is 127, if it could not be
executed, the exit status is 126);
the exit status of other command constructs (built-in commands, functions,
compound-commands, pipelines, lists, \fIetc.\fP) are all well defined and are
described where the construct is described.
The exit status of a command consisting only of parameter assignments is that
of the last command substitution performed during the parameter assignment
or zero if there were no command substitutions.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  pipeline
.PP
Commands can be chained together using the \fB|\fP token to
form \fIpipelines\fP, in which the standard output of each command but
the last is piped (see \fIpipe\fP(2)) to the standard input of the following
command.
The exit status of a pipeline is that of its last command.
A pipeline may be prefixed by the \fB!\fP reserved word which
causes the exit status of the pipeline to be logically
complemented: if the original status was 0 the complemented status will
be 1, and if the original status was not 0, then the complemented
status will be 0.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  lists
.PP
\fILists\fP of commands can be created by separating pipelines by
any of the following tokens: \fB&&\fP, \fB||\fP, \fB&\fP, \fB|&\fP and \fB;\fP.
The first two are for conditional execution: \fIcmd1\fP \fB&&\fP \fIcmd2\fP
executes \fIcmd2\fP only if the exit status of \fIcmd1\fP is zero;
\fB||\fP is the opposite \(em \fIcmd2\fP is executed only if the exit status
of \fIcmd1\fP is non-zero.
\fB&&\fP and \fB||\fP have equal precedence which is higher than that of
\fB&\fP, \fB|&\fP and \fB;\fP, which also have equal precedence.
The \fB&\fP token causes the preceding command to be executed asynchronously,
that is, the shell starts the command, but does not wait for it to complete
(the shell does keep track of the status of asynchronous commands \(em see
Job Control below).
When an asynchronous command is started when job control is disabled
(\fIi.e.\fP, in most scripts), the command is started with signals INT
and QUIT ignored and with input redirected from /dev/null
(however, redirections specified in the asynchronous command have precedence).
The \fB|&\fP operator starts a \fIco-process\fP which is special kind of
asynchronous process (see Co-Processes below).
Note that a command must follow the \fB&&\fP and \fB||\fP operators, while
a command need not follow \fB&\fP, \fB|&\fP and \fB;\fP.
The exit status of a list is that of the last command executed, with the
exception of asynchronous lists, for which the exit status is 0.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  compound-commands
.PP
Compound commands are created using the following reserved words \(em these
words are only recognized if they are unquoted and if they are used as
the first word of a command (\fIi.e.\fP, they can't be preceded by parameter
assignments or redirections):
.TS
center;
lfB lfB lfB lfB lfB .
case	else	function	then	!
do	esac	if	time	[[
done	fi	in	until	{
elif	for	select	while	}
.TE
\fBNote:\fP Some shells (but not this one) execute control structure commands
in a subshell when one or more of their file descriptors are redirected, so
any environment changes inside them may fail.
To be portable, the \fBexec\fP statement should be used instead to redirect
file descriptors before the control structure.
.PP
In the following compound command descriptions, command lists (denoted as
\fIlist\fP) that are followed by reserved words must end with a
semi-colon, a newline or a (syntactically correct) reserved word.
For example,
.RS
\fB{ echo foo; echo bar; }\fP
.br
\fB{ echo foo; echo bar<newline>}\fP
.br
\fB{ { echo foo; echo bar; } }\fP
.RE
are all valid, but
.RS
\fB{ echo foo; echo bar }\fP
.RE
is not.
.\"{{{  ( list )

The \fBcase\fP statement attempts to match \fIword\fP against the specified
\fIpattern\fPs; the \fIlist\fP associated with the first successfully matched
pattern is executed.  Patterns used in \fBcase\fP statements are the same as
those used for file name patterns except that the restrictions regarding
\fB\&.\fP and \fB/\fP are dropped.  Note that any unquoted space before and
after a pattern is stripped; any space with a pattern must be quoted.  Both the
word and the patterns are subject to parameter, command, and arithmetic
substitution as well as tilde substitution.
For historical reasons, open and close braces may be used instead
of \fBin\fP and \fBesac\fP (\fIe.g.\fP, \fBcase $foo { *) echo bar; }\fP).
The exit status of a \fBcase\fP statement is that of the executed \fIlist\fP;

where \fIterm\fP is either a newline or a \fB;\fP.
For each \fIword\fP in the specified word list, the parameter \fIname\fP is
set to the word and \fIlist\fP is executed.  If \fBin\fP is not used to
specify a word list, the positional parameters (\fB"$1"\fP, \fB"$2"\fP,
\fIetc.\fP) are used instead.
For historical reasons, open and close braces may be used instead
of \fBdo\fP and \fBdone\fP (\fIe.g.\fP, \fBfor i; { echo $i; }\fP).
The exit status of a \fBfor\fP statement is the last exit status

If the exit status of the first \fIlist\fP is zero, the second \fIlist\fP
is executed; otherwise the \fIlist\fP following the \fBelif\fP, if any, is
executed with similar consequences.  If all the lists following the \fBif\fP
and \fBelif\fPs fail (\fIi.e.\fP, exit with non-zero status), the \fIlist\fP
following the \fBelse\fP is executed.
The exit status of an \fBif\fP statement is that

where \fIterm\fP is either a newline or a \fB;\fP.
The \fBselect\fP statement provides an automatic method of presenting
the user with a menu and selecting from it.
An enumerated list of the specified \fIwords\fP is printed on standard
error, followed by a prompt (\fBPS3\fP, normally `\fB#? \fP').
A number corresponding to one of the enumerated words is then read
from standard input, \fIname\fP is set to the selected word (or is
unset if the selection is not valid), \fBREPLY\fP
is set to what was read (leading/trailing space is stripped),
and \fIlist\fP is executed.
If a blank line (\fIi.e.\fP, zero or more \fBIFS\fP characters) is entered,
the menu is re-printed without executing \fIlist\fP.
When \fIlist\fP completes, the enumerated list is printed if \fBREPLY\fP
is null, the prompt is printed and so on.
This process is continues until an end-of-file is read, an interrupt is
received or a break statement is executed inside the loop.
If \fBin\fP \fIword\fP \fB\&...\fP is omitted, the positional parameters
are used (\fIi.e.\fP, \fB"$1"\fP, \fB"$2"\fP, \fIetc.\fP).
For historical reasons, open and close braces may be used instead
of \fBdo\fP and \fBdone\fP (\fIe.g.\fP, \fBselect i; { echo $i; }\fP).

.\"{{{  Quoting
.SS Quoting
Quoting is used to prevent the shell from treating characters or words
specially.
There are three methods of quoting: First, \fB\e\fP quotes
the following character, unless it is at the end of a line, in which
case both the \fB\e\fP and the newline are stripped.
Second, a single quote (\fB'\fP) quotes everything up to the next single
quote (this may span lines).
Third, a double quote (\fB"\fP) quotes all characters,
except \fB$\fP, \fB`\fP and \fB\e\fP, up to the next unquoted double quote.
\fB$\fP and \fB`\fP inside double quotes have their usual meaning (\fIi.e.\fP,
parameter, command or arithmetic substitution) except no field splitting
is carried out on the results of double-quoted substitutions.
If a \fB\e\fP inside a double-quoted string is followed by \fB\e\fP, \fB$\fP,
\fB`\fP or \fB"\fP, it is replaced by the second character; if it is
followed by a newline, both the \fB\e\fP and the newline are stripped;
otherwise, both the \fB\e\fP and the character following are unchanged.

Note: see POSIX Mode below for a special rule regarding sequences
of the form \fB"\fP...\fB`\fP...\fB\e"\fP...\fB`\fP..\fB"\fP.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  Aliases
.SS "Aliases"
There are two types of aliases: normal command aliases and tracked
aliases.  Command aliases are normally used as a short hand for a long
or often used command.  The shell expands command aliases (\fIi.e.\fP,
substitutes the alias name for its value) when it reads the first word
of a command.  An expanded alias is re-processed to check for more
aliases.  If a command alias ends in a space or tab, the following word
is also checked for alias expansion.  The alias expansion process stops
when a word that is not an alias is found, when a quoted word is found
or when an alias word that is currently being expanded is found.
.PP
The following command aliases are defined automatically by the shell:
.ft B
.RS
autoload='typeset \-fu'
.br
functions='typeset \-f'
.br
hash='alias \-t'
.br
history='fc \-l'
.br
integer='typeset \-i'
.br
local='typeset'
.br
login='exec login'
.br
newgrp='exec newgrp'
.br
nohup='nohup '
.br
r='fc \-e \-'
.br
stop='kill \-STOP'
.br
suspend='kill \-STOP $$'
.br
type='whence \-v'
.RE
.ft P
.PP
Tracked aliases allow the shell to remember where it found a particular
command.  The first time the shell does a path search for a command that
is marked as a tracked alias, it saves the full path of the command.
The next time the command is executed, the shell checks the saved path
to see that it is still valid, and if so, avoids repeating the path
search.  Tracked aliases can be listed and created using \fBalias
\-t\fP.  Note that changing the \fBPATH\fP parameter clears the saved
paths for all tracked aliases.  If the \fBtrackall\fP option is set (\fIi.e.\fP,
\fBset \-o trackall\fP or \fBset \-h\fP), the shell tracks all
commands.  This option is set automatically for non-interactive shells.
For interactive shells, only the following commands are automatically
tracked: \fBcat\fP, \fBcc\fP, \fBchmod\fP, \fBcp\fP, \fBdate\fP, \fBed\fP,
\fBemacs\fP, \fBgrep\fP, \fBls\fP, \fBmail\fP, \fBmake\fP, \fBmv\fP,
\fBpr\fP, \fBrm\fP, \fBsed\fP, \fBsh\fP, \fBvi\fP and \fBwho\fP.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  Substitution
.SS "Substitution"
The first step the shell takes in executing a simple-command is to
perform substitutions on the words of the command.
There are three kinds of substitution: parameter, command and arithmetic.
Parameter substitutions, which are described in detail in the next section,
take the form \fB$name\fP or \fB${\fP...\fB}\fP; command substitutions take
the form \fB$(\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB)\fP or \fB`\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB`\fP;
and arithmetic substitutions take the form \fB$((\fP\fIexpression\fP\fB))\fP.
.PP
If a substitution appears outside of double quotes, the results of the
substitution are generally subject to word or field splitting according to
the current value of the \fBIFS\fP parameter.
The \fBIFS\fP parameter specifies a list of characters which 
are used to break a string up into several words;
any characters from the set space, tab and newline that appear in the
IFS characters are called \fIIFS white space\fP.
Sequences of one or more IFS white space characters, in combination with
zero or one non-IFS white space characters delimit a field.
As a special case, leading and trailing IFS white space is stripped (\fIi.e.\fP,
no leading or trailing empty field is created by it); leading or trailing
non-IFS white space does create an empty field.
Example: if \fBIFS\fP is set to `<space>:', the sequence of characters
`<space>A<space>:<space><space>B::D' contains four fields: `A', `B', `' and `D'.
Note that if the \fBIFS\fP parameter is set to the null string, no
field splitting is done; if the parameter is unset, the default value
of space, tab and newline is used.
.PP
The results of substitution are, unless otherwise specified, also subject
to brace expansion and file name expansion (see the relevant sections
below).
.PP
A command substitution is replaced by the output generated by the specified
command, which is run in a subshell.
For \fB$(\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB)\fP substitutions, normal quoting rules
are used when \fIcommand\fP is parsed, however, for the
\fB`\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB`\fP form, a \fB\e\fP followed by any of
\fB$\fP, \fB`\fP or \fB\e\fP is stripped (a \fB\e\fP followed by any other
character is unchanged).
As a special case in command substitutions, a command of the form
\fB<\fP \fIfile\fP is interpreted to mean substitute the contents

NOTE: \fB$(\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB)\fP expressions are currently parsed by
finding the matching parenthesis, regardless of quoting.  This will hopefully
be fixed soon.

Arithmetic substitutions are replaced by the value of the specified

For example, the command \fBecho $((2+3*4))\fP prints 14.
See Arithmetic Expressions for a description of an \fIexpression\fP.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  Parameters
.SS "Parameters"
Parameters are shell variables; they can be assigned values and
their values can be accessed using a parameter substitution.
A parameter name is either one of the special single punctuation or digit
character parameters described below, or a letter followed by zero or more
letters or digits (`_' counts as a letter).
Parameter substitutions take the form \fB$\fP\fIname\fP or
\fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB}\fP, where \fIname\fP is a parameter name.
If substitution is performed on a parameter that is not set, a null
string is substituted unless the \fBnounset\fP option (\fBset \-o nounset\fP
or \fBset \-u\fP) is set, in which case an error occurs.
.PP
.\"{{{  parameter assignment
Parameters can be assigned values in a number of ways.
First, the shell implicitly sets some parameters like \fB#\fP, \fBPWD\fP,
etc.; this is the only way the special single character parameters are
set.
Second, parameters are imported from the shell's environment at startup.
Third, parameters can be assigned values on the command line, for example,
`\fBFOO=bar\fP' sets the parameter FOO to bar; multiple parameter
assignments can be given on a single command line and they can
be followed by a simple-command, in which case the assignments are
in effect only for the duration of the command (such assignments are
also exported, see below for implications of this).
Note that both the parameter name and the \fB=\fP must be unquoted for
the shell to recognize a parameter assignment.
The fourth way of setting a parameter is with the \fBexport\fP, \fBreadonly\fP
and \fBtypeset\fP commands; see their descriptions in the Command Execution
section.
Fifth, \fBfor\fP and \fBselect\fP loops set parameters as well as
the \fBgetopts\fP, \fBread\fP and \fBset \-A\fP commands.
Lastly, parameters can be assigned values using assignment operators
inside arithmetic expressions (see Arithmetic Expressions below) or
using the \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP\fB}\fP form
of parameter substitution (see below).
.\"}}}
.PP
.\"{{{  environment
Parameters with the export attribute (set using the \fBexport\fP or
\fBtypeset \-x\fP commands, or by parameter assignments followed by simple
commands) are put in the environment (see \fIenviron\fP(5)) of commands
run by the shell as \fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP pairs.
The order in which parameters appear in the environment of a command
is unspecified.
When the shell starts up, it extracts parameters and their values from its
environment and automatically sets the export attribute for those parameters.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  ${name[:][-+=?]word}
.PP
Modifiers can be applied to the \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB}\fP form of parameter
substitution:
.IP \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB:-\fP\fIword\fP\fB}\fP
if \fIname\fP is set and not null, it is substituted, otherwise \fIword\fP is
substituted.
.IP \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB:+\fP\fIword\fP\fB}\fP
if \fIname\fP is set and not null, \fIword\fP is substituted, otherwise nothing is substituted.
.IP \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB:=\fP\fIword\fP\fB}\fP
if \fIname\fP is set and not null, it is substituted, otherwise it is
assigned \fIword\fP and the resulting value of \fIname\fP is substituted.
.IP \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB:?\fP\fIword\fP\fB}\fP
if \fIname\fP is set and not null, it is substituted, otherwise \fIword\fP
is printed on standard error (preceded by \fIname\fP:) and an error occurs
(normally causing termination of a shell script, function or \&.-script).
If word is omitted the string `parameter null or not set' is used instead.
.PP
In the above modifiers, the \fB:\fP can be omitted, in which case the
conditions only depend on \fIname\fP being set (as opposed to set and
not null).
If \fIword\fP is needed, parameter, command, arithmetic and tilde substitution
are performed on it; if \fIword\fP is not needed, it is not evaluated.

If \fIpattern\fP matches the beginning of the value of parameter \fIname\fP,
the matched text is deleted from the result of substitution.  A single
\fB#\fP results in the shortest match, two \fB#\fP's results in the
longest match.

escape codes in the prompt tend to mess things up.
You can tell the shell not to count certain sequences (such as escape codes)
by prefixing your prompt with a non-printing character (such as control-A)
followed by a carriage return and then delimiting the escape codes with

.\"{{{  File Name Patterns
.SS "File Name Patterns"
.PP
A file name pattern is a word containing one or more unquoted \fB?\fP or
\fB*\fP characters or \fB[\fP..\fB]\fP sequences.  Once brace expansion has
been performed, the shell replaces file name patterns with the sorted names
of all the files that match the pattern (if no files match, the word is
left unchanged).  The pattern elements have the following meaning:
.IP \fB?\fP
matches any single character.
.IP \fB*\fP
matches any sequence of characters.
.IP \fB[\fP..\fB]\fP
matches any of the characters inside the brackets.  Ranges of characters
can be specified by separating two characters by a \fB\-\fP, \fIe.g.\fP,
\fB[a0\-9]\fP matches the letter \fBa\fP or any digit.
In order to represent itself, a
\fB\-\fP must either be quoted or the first or last character in the character
list.  Similarly, a \fB]\fP must be quoted or the first character in the list
if it is represent itself instead of the end of the list.  Also, a \fB!\fP
appearing at the start of the list has special meaning (see below), so to
represent itself it must be quoted or appear later in the list.
.IP \fB[!\fP..\fB]\fP
like \fB[\fP..\fB]\fP, except it matches any character not inside the brackets.
.IP "\fB*(\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB|\fP ... \fP|\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB)\fP"
matches any string of characters that matches zero or more occurances
of the specified patterns.
Example: the pattern \fB*(foo|bar)\fP matches the strings
`', `foo', `bar', `foobarfoo', \fIetc.\fP.
.IP "\fB+(\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB|\fP ... \fP|\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB)\fP"
matches any string of characters that matches one or more occurances
of the specified patterns.
Example: the pattern \fB+(foo|bar)\fP matches the strings
`foo', `bar', `foobarfoo', \fIetc.\fP.
.IP "\fB?(\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB|\fP ... \fP|\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB)\fP"
matches the empty string or a string that matches one of the
specified patterns.
Example: the pattern \fB?(foo|bar)\fP only matches the strings
`', `foo' and `bar'.
.IP "\fB@(\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB|\fP ... \fP|\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB)\fP"
matches a string that matches one of the
specified patterns.
Example: the pattern \fB@(foo|bar)\fP only matches the strings
`foo' and `bar'.
.IP "\fB!(\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB|\fP ... \fP|\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB)\fP"
matches any string that does not match one of the specified
patterns.
Examples: the pattern \fB!(foo|bar)\fP matches all strings except
`foo' and `bar'; the pattern \fB!(*)\fP matches no strings;
the pattern \fB!(?)*\fP matches all strings (think about it).

Note that pdksh currently never matches \fB.\fP and \fB..\fP, but the original
ksh, Bourne sh and bash do, so this may have to change (too bad).

Note that none of the above pattern elements match either a period (\fB.\fP)
at the start of a file name or a slash (\fB/\fP), even if they are explicitly
used in a \fB[\fP..\fB]\fP sequence; also, the names \fB.\fP and \fB..\fP
are never matched, even by the pattern \fB.*\fP.

.\"{{{  Input/Output Redirection
.SS "Input/Output Redirection"
When a command is executed, its standard input, standard output and
standard error (file descriptors 0, 1 and 2, respectively) are normally
inherited from the shell.
Three exceptions to this are commands in pipelines, for which standard input
and/or standard output are those set up by the pipeline, asynchronous commands
created when job control is disabled, for which standard input is initially
set to be from \fB/dev/null\fP, and commands for which any of the following
redirections have been specified:
.IP "\fB>\fP \fIfile\fP"
standard output is redirected to \fIfile\fP.  If \fIfile\fP does not exist,
it is created; if it does exist, is a regular file and the \fBnoclobber\fP
option is set, an error occurs, otherwise the file is truncated.
Note that this means the command \fIcmd < foo > foo\fP will open
\fIfoo\fP for reading and then truncate it when it opens it for writing,
before \fIcmd\fP gets a chance to actually read \fIfoo\fP.
.IP "\fB>|\fP \fIfile\fP"
same as \fB>\fP, except the file is truncated, even if the \fBnoclobber\fP
option is set.
.IP "\fB>>\fP \fIfile\fP"
same as \fB>\fP, except the file an existing file is appended to instead
of being truncated.  Also, the file is opened in append mode, so writes
always go to the end of the file (see \fIopen\fP(2)).
.IP "\fB<\fP \fIfile\fP"
standard input is redirected from \fIfile\fP, which is opened for reading.
.IP "\fB<>\fP \fIfile\fP"
same as \fB<\fP, except the file is opened for reading and writing.
.IP "\fB<<\fP \fImarker\fP"
after reading the command line containing this kind of redirection (called a
here document), the shell copies lines from the command source into a temporary
file until a line matching \fImarker\fP is read.
When the command is executed, standard input is redirected from the temporary
file.
If \fImarker\fP contains no quoted characters, the contents of the
temporary file are processed as if enclosed in double quotes each time
the command is executed, so parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions
are performed, along with backslash (\fB\e\fP) escapes for
\fB$\fP, \fB`\fP, \fB\e\fP and \fB\enewline\fP.
If multiple here documents are used on the same command line, they are
saved in order.
.IP "\fB<<-\fP \fImarker\fP"
same as \fB<<\fP, except leading tabs are stripped from lines in the
here document.
.IP "\fB<&\fP \fIfd\fP"
standard input is duplicated from file descriptor \fIfd\fP.
\fIfd\fP can be a single digit, indicating the number of an existing
file descriptor, the letter \fBp\fP, indicating the file descriptor
associated with the output of the current co-process, or
the character \fB\-\fP, indicating standard input is to be closed.
.IP "\fB>&\fP \fIfd\fP"
same as \fB<&\fP, except the operation is done on standard output.
.PP
In any of the above redirections, the file descriptor that is redirected
(\fIi.e.\fP, standard input or standard output) can be explicitly given by
preceding the redirection with a single digit.
Parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions, tilde substitutions and
file name generation are all performed on the \fIfile\fP, \fImarker\fP and
\fIfd\fP arguments of redirections.
Note however, that the results of any file name generation are only used
if a single file is matched; if multiple files match, the word with the
unexpanded file name generation characters is used.
Note that in restricted shells, redirections which can create files cannot
be used.
.PP

.SS "Arithmetic Expressions"
Integer arithmetic expressions can be used with the \fBlet\fP command,
inside \fB$((\fP..\fB))\fP expressions,
inside array references (\fIe.g.\fP, \fIname\fP\fB[\fP\fIexpr\fP\fB]\fP),
as numeric arguments to the \fBtest\fP command,
and as the value of an assignment to an integer parameter.
.PP
Expression may contain alpha-numeric parameter identifiers, array
references, and integer constants and may be combined with the
following C operators (listed and grouped in increasing order of precedence).

.TP
Grouping operators:

.PP
Integer constants may be specified with arbitrary bases using the notation
\fIbase\fP\fB#\fP\fInumber\fP, where \fIbase\fP is a decimal integer specifying
the base, and \fInumber\fP is a number in the specified base.
.LP
The operators are evaluated as follows:
.RS
.IP "unary \fB+\fP"
result is the argument (included for completeness).
.IP "unary \fB\-\fP"
negation.
.IP "\fB!\fP"
logical not; the result is 1 if argument is zero, 0 if not.
.IP "\fB~\fP"
arithmetic (bit-wise) not.
.IP "\fB++\fP"
increment; must be applied to a parameter (not a literal or other
expression) - the parameter is incremented by 1.
When used as a prefix operator, the result is the incremented value of
the parameter, when used as a postfix operator, the result is the
original value of the parameter.
.IP "\fB++\fP"
similar to \fB++\fP, except the paramter is decremented by 1.
.IP "\fB,\fP"
seperates two arithmetic expressions; the left hand side is evaluated first,
then the right.  The result is value of the expression on the right hand side.
.IP "\fB=\fP"
assignment; variable on the left is set to the value on the right.
.IP "\fB*= /= %= += \-= <<= >>= &= ^= |=\fP"
assignment operators; \fI<var> <op>\fP\fB=\fP \fI<expr>\fP is the same as
\fI<var>\fP \fB=\fP \fI<var> <op>\fP \fB(\fP \fI<expr>\fP \fB)\fP.
.IP "\fB||\fP"
logical or; the result is 1 if either argument is non-zero, 0 if not.
The right argument is evaluated only if the left argument is zero.
.IP "\fB&&\fP"
logical and; the result is 1 if both arguments are non-zero, 0 if not.
The right argument is evaluated only if the left argument is non-zero.
.IP "\fB|\fP"
arithmetic (bit-wise) or.
.IP "\fB^\fP"
arithmetic (bit-wise) exclusive-or.
.IP "\fB&\fP"
arithmetic (bit-wise) and.
.IP "\fB==\fP"
equal; the result is 1 if both arguments are equal, 0 if not.
.IP "\fB!=\fP"
not equal; the result is 0 if both arguments are equal, 1 if not.
.IP "\fB<\fP"
less than; the result is 1 if the left argument is less than the right,
0 if not.
.IP "\fB<= >= >\fP"
less than or equal, greater than or equal, greater than.  See <.
.IP "\fB<< >>\fP"
shift left (right); the result is the left argument with its bits shifted
left (right) by the amount given in the right argument.
.IP "\fB+ - * /\fP"
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
.IP "\fB%\fP"
remainder; the result is the remainder of the division of the left argument

.\"{{{  Co-Processes
.SS "Co-Processes"
A co-process, which is a pipeline created with the \fB|&\fP operator,
is an asynchronous process that the shell can both write to
(using \fBprint \-p\fP) and read from (using \fBread \-p\fP).
The input and output of the co-process can also be manipulated
using \fB>&p\fP and \fB<&p\fP redirections, respectively.
Once a co-process has been started, another can't be started until
the co-process exits, or until the co-process input has been redirected using
an \fBexec \fP\fIn\fP\fB>&p\fP redirection.
If a co-process's input is redirected in this way, the next 
co-process to be started will share the output with the first co-process,
unless the output of the initial co-process has been redirected using an
\fBexec \fP\fIn\fP\fB<&p\fP redirection.
.PP
Some notes concerning co-processes:
.nr P2 \n(PD
.nr PD 0
.IP \ \ \(bu
the only way to close the co-process input (so the co-process reads
an end-of-file) is to redirect the input to a numbered file descriptor
and then close that file descriptor (\fIe.g.\fP, \fBexec 3>&p;exec 3>&-\fP).
.IP \ \ \(bu
in order for co-processes to share a common output, the shell must keep
the write portion of the output pipe open.
This means that end of file will not be detected until all co-processes
sharing the co-process output have exited (when they all exit, the shell
closes its copy of the pipe).
This can be avoided by redirecting the output to a numbered
file descriptor (as this also causes the shell to close its copy).
Note that this behaviour is slightly different from the original Korn shell
which closes its copy of the write portion of the co-processs output when the
most recently started co-process (instead of when all sharing co-processes)
exits.
.IP \ \ \(bu
\fBprint \-p\fP will ignore SIGPIPE signals during writes
if the signal is not being trapped or ignored; the same is not true if
the co-process input has been duplicated to another file descriptor and
\fBprint \-u\fP\fIn\fP is used.
.nr PD \n(P2
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  Functions
.SS "Functions"
Functions are defined using either Korn shell \fBfunction\fP \fIname\fP
syntax or the Bourne/POSIX shell \fIname\fP\fB()\fP syntax
(see below for the difference between the two forms).
Functions are like \fB.\fP-scripts in that they are executed in
the current environment, however, unlike \fB.\fP-scripts, shell arguments
(\fIi.e.\fP, positional parameters, \fB$1\fP, \fIetc.\fP) are never visible
inside them.
When the shell is determining the location of a command, functions are
searched after special built-in commands, and before regular and non-regular
built-ins, and before the \fBPATH\fP is searched.
.PP
An existing function may be deleted using \fBunset \-f\fP \fIfunction-name\fP.
A list of functions can be obtained using \fBtypeset +f\fP and the
function definitions can be listed using \fBtypeset \-f\fP.
\fBautoload\fP (which is an alias for \fBtypeset \-fu\fP) may be used to
create undefined functions; when an undefined function is executed, the
shell searches the path specified in the \fBFPATH\fP parameter for a file
with the same name as the function, which, if found is read and executed.
If after executing the file, the named function is found to be defined, the
function is executed, otherwise, the normal command search is continued
(\fIi.e.\fP, the shell searches the regular built-in command table
and \fBPATH\fP).
Note that if a command is not found using \fBPATH\fP, an attempt is
made to autoload a function using \fBFPATH\fP (this is an undocumented
feature of the original Korn shell).
.PP
Functions can have two attributes, trace and export, which can be set
with \fBtypeset \-ft\fP and \fBtypeset \-fx\fP, respectively.
When a traced function is executed, the shell's \fBxtrace\fP option is turned
on for the functions duration, otherwise the \fBxtrace\fP option is turned off.
The export attribute of functions is currently not used.  In the original
Korn shell, exported functions are visible to shell scripts that are executed.
.PP
Since functions are executed in the current shell environment, parameter
assignments made inside functions are visible after the function completes.
If this is not the desired effect, the \fBtypeset\fP command can be used
inside a function to create a local parameter.
Note that special parameters (\fIe.g.\fP, \fB$$\fP, \fB$!\fP) can't be
scoped in this way.
.PP
The exit status of a function is that of the last command executed in
the function.
A function can be made to finish immediately using the \fBreturn\fP command;
this may also be used to explicitly specify the exit status.
.PP
Functions defined with the \fBfunction\fP reserved word are
treated differently in the following ways from functions defined with
the \fB()\fP notation:
.nr P2 \n(PD
.nr PD 0
.IP \ \ \(bu
the \fB$0\fP parameter is set to the name of the function
(Bourne-style functions leave \fB$0\fP untouched).
.IP \ \ \(bu
parameter assignments preceeding function calls are not kept in
the shell environment
(executing Bourne-style functions will keep assignments).
.nr PD \n(P2
In the future, the following differences will also be added:
.nr P2 \n(PD
.nr PD 0
.IP \ \ \(bu
A separate trap/signal environment will be used during the execution of
functions.
This will mean that traps set inside a function will not affect the shell's
traps and signals that are not ignored in the shell (but may be trapped) will
have their default effect in a function.
.IP \ \ \(bu
The EXIT trap, if set in a function, will be executed after the function
returns.
.nr PD \n(P2
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  POSIX mode
.SS "POSIX Mode"
The shell is intended to be POSIX compliant, however, in some cases, POSIX
behaviour is contrary either to the original Korn shell behaviour or to
user convenience.
How the shell behaves in these cases is determined by the state of
the posix option (\fBset \-o posix\fP) \(em if it is on, the POSIX behaviour
is followed, otherwise it is not.
The \fBposix\fP option is set automatically when the shell starts up
if the environment contains the \fBPOSIXLY_CORRECT\fP parameter.
(The shell can also be compiled so that it is in POSIX mode by default,
however this is usually not desirable).
.PP
The following is a list of things that are affected by the state of
the \fBposix\fP option:
.nr P2 \n(PD
.nr PD 0
.IP \ \ \(bu
\fB\e"\fP inside double quoted \fB`\fP..\fB`\fP command substitutions:
in posix mode, the \fB\e"\fP is interpreted when the command is interpreted;
in non-posix mode, the backslash is stripped before the command substitution
is interpreted.  For example, \fBecho "`echo \e"hi\e"`"\fP produces `"hi"' in
posix mode, `hi' in non-posix mode.  To avoid problems, use the \fB$(...\fP)
form of command substitution.
.IP \ \ \(bu
\fBkill \-l\fP output: in posix mode, signal names are listed one a single line;
in non-posix mode, signal numbers, names and descriptions are printed in
columns.
In future, a new option (\fB\-v\fP perhaps) will be added to distinguish
the two behaviours.
.IP \ \ \(bu
\fBfg\fP exit status: in posix mode, the exit status is 0 if no errors occur;
in non-posix mode, the exit status is that of the last foregrounded job.
.IP \ \ \(bu
\fBgetopts\fP: in posix mode, options must start with a \fB\-\fP; in non-posix
mode, options can start with either \fB\-\fP or \fB+\fP.
.IP \ \ \(bu
brace expansion (also known as alternation): in posix mode, brace expansion
is disabled; in non-posix mode, brace expansion enabled.
Note that \fBset \-o posix\fP (or setting the \fBPOSIXLY_CORRECT\fP parameter)
automatically turns the \fBbraceexpand\fP option off, however it can be
explicitly turned on later.
.IP \ \ \(bu
\fBset \-\fP: in posix mode, this does not clear the \fBverbose\fP or
\fBxtrace\fP options; in non-posix mode, it does.
.IP \ \ \(bu
\fBset\fP exit status: in posix mode, the exit status of set is 0
if there are no errors; in non-posix mode, the exit status is that of
any command substitutions performed in generating the set command.
For example, `\fBset \-\- `false`; echo $?\fP' prints 0 in posix mode,
1 in non-posix mode.  This construct is used in most shell scripts that
use the old \fIgetopt\fP(1) command.
.IP \ \ \(bu
argument expansion of \fBalias\fP, \fBexport\fP, \fBreadonly\fP, and
\fBtypeset\fP commands: in posix mode, normal argument expansion done;
in non-posix mode, field splitting, file globing, brace expansion and
(normal) tilde expansion are turned off, and assignment tilde expansion
is turned on.
.IP \ \ \(bu
signal specification: in posix mode, signals can be specified as digits only
if signal numbers match POSIX values (\fIi.e.\fP, HUP=1, INT=2, QUIT=3, ABRT=6,
KILL=9, ALRM=14, and TERM=15); in non-posix mode, signals can be always digits.
.IP \ \ \(bu
alias expansion: in posix mode, alias expansion is only carried out when
reading command words; in non-posix mode, alias expansion is carried out
on any word following an alias that ended in a space.
For example, the following for loop
.RS
.ft B
alias a='for ' i='j'
.br
a i in 1 2; do echo i=$i j=$j; done
.ft P
.RE
uses parameter \fBi\fP in posix mode, \fBj\fP in non-posix mode.

.\"{{{  Command Execution (built-in commands)
.SS "Command Execution"
After evaluation of command line arguments, redirections and parameter
assignments, the type of command is determined: a special built-in,
a function, a regular built-in or the name of a file to execute found
using the \fBPATH\fP parameter.
The checks are made in the above order.
Special built-in commands differ from other commands in that 
the \fBPATH\fP parameter is not used to find them, an error
during their execution can cause a non-interactive shell to exit and
parameter assignments that are specified before the command are
kept after the command completes.
Just to confuse things, if the posix option is turned off (see \fBset\fP
command below) some special commands are very special in that
no field splitting, file globing, brace expansion nor tilde expansion
is preformed on arguments that look like assignments.
Regular built-in commands are different only in that the \fBPATH\fP
parameter is not used to find them.

.\"{{{  job control (and its built-in commands)
.SS "Job Control"
Job control refers to the shell's ability to monitor and control \fBjobs\fP,
which are processes or groups of processes created for commands or pipelines.
At a minimum, the shell keeps track of the status of the background
(\fIi.e.\fP, asynchronous) jobs that currently exist; this information can be
displayed using the \fBjobs\fP command.
If job control is fully enabled (using \fBset \-m\fP or
\fBset \-o monitor\fP), as it is for interactive shells,
the processes of a job are placed in their own process group,
foreground jobs can be stopped by typing the suspend character from the
terminal (normally ^Z),
jobs can be restarted in either the foreground
or background, using the \fBfg\fP and \fBbg\fP commands, respectively,
and the state of the terminal is saved or restored when a foreground
job is stopped or restarted, respectively.
.sp
Note that only commands that create processes (\fIe.g.\fP,
asynchronous commands, subshell commands, and non-built-in,
non-function commands) can be stopped; commands like \fBread\fP cannot be.
.sp
When a job is created, it is assigned a job-number.
For interactive shells, this number is printed inside \fB[\fP..\fB]\fP,
followed by the process-ids of the processes in the job when an asynchronous
command is run.
A job may be referred to in \fBbg\fP, \fBfg\fP, \fBjobs\fP, \fBkill\fP and
\fBwait\fP commands either by the process id of the last process in the
command pipeline (as stored in the \fB$!\fP parameter) or by prefixing the
job-number with a percent sign (\fB%\fP).
Other percent sequences can also be used to refer to jobs:
.sp
.TS

afB lw(4.5i).
%+	T{
The most recently stopped job, or, if there are no stopped jobs, the oldest
running job.

.IP "\fBDone\fP [\fB(\fP\fInumber\fP\fB)\fP]"
the job exited. \fInumber\fP is the exit status of the job, which is
omitted if the status is zero.
.IP "\fBStopped\fP [\fB(\fP\fIsignal\fP\fB)\fP]"
the job was stopped by the indicated \fIsignal\fP (if no signal is given,
the job was stopped by SIGTSTP).
.IP "\fIsignal-description\fP [\fB(core dumped)\fP]"
the job was killed by a signal (\fIe.g.\fP, Memory\ fault,
Hangup, \fIetc.\fP \(em use
\fBkill \-l\fP for a list of signal descriptions).
The \fB(core\ dumped)\fP message indicates the process created a core file.
.RE
.IP "\ \fIcommand\fP"
is the command that created the process.
If there are multiple processes in the job, then each process will

.PP
When an attempt is made to exit the shell while there are jobs in
the stopped state, the shell warns the user that there are stopped jobs
and does not exit.
If another attempt is immediately made to exit the shell, the stopped
jobs are sent a \fBHUP\fP signal and the shell exits.
Similarly, if the \fBnohup\fP option is not set and there are running
jobs when an attempt is made to exit a login shell, the shell warns the
user and does not exit.
If another attempt is immediately made to exit the shell, the running
jobs are sent a \fBHUP\fP signal and the shell exits.

In this mode various editing commands (typically bound to one or more

.PP
The following is a list of editing commands available.
Each description starts with the name of the command,
a \fIn\fP, if the command can be prefixed with a count,
and any keys the command is bound to by default (written using
caret notation, \fIe.g.\fP, ASCII ESC character is written as ^[).
A count prefix for a command is entered using the sequence
\fB^[\fP\fIn\fP, where \fIn\fP is a sequence of 1 or more digits;
unless otherwise specified, if a count is omitted, it defaults to 1.
Note that editing command names are
used only with the \fBbind\fP command.  Furthermore, many editing
commands are useful only on terminals with a visible cursor.  The
default bindings were chosen to resemble corresponding EMACS key
bindings.  The users tty characters (\fIe.g.\fP, ERASE) are bound to
reasonable substitutes and override the default bindings.

(see \fIstty\fP(1)) and have their usual meaning (normal values are in
parentheses):
kill (\fB^U\fP), erase (\fB^?\fP), werase (\fB^W\fP), eof (\fB^D\fP),
intr (\fB^C\fP) and quit (\fB^\e\fP).
In addition to the above, the following characters are also treated
specially in insert mode:
.TS
expand;
afB lw(4.5i).
^H	T{
erases previous character
T}
^V	T{
literal next: the next character typed is not treated specially (can be
used to insert the characters being described here)
T}
^J ^M	T{
end of line: the current line is read, parsed and executed by the shell

.PP
If a line is longer that the screen width (see \fBCOLUMNS\fP parameter),
a \fB>\fP, \fB+\fP or \fB<\fP character is displayed in the last column
indicating that there are more characters after, before and after, or
before the current position, respectively.
The line is scrolled horizontally as necessary.

.\"{{{  command mode
.PP
In command mode, each character is interpreted as a command.
Characters that don't correspond to commands, are illegal combinations of
commands or are commands that can't be carried out all cause beeps.
In the following command descriptions, a \fIn\fP indicates the
command may be prefixed by a number (\fIe.g.\fP, \fB10l\fP moves right 10
characters); if no number prefix is used, \fIn\fP is assumed to be 1
unless otherwise specified.
The term `current position' refers to the position between the cursor
and the character preceding the cursor.
A `word' is a sequence of letters, digits and underscore characters or a
sequence of non-letter, non-digit, non-underscore, non-white-space characters
(\fIe.g.\fP, ab2*&^ contains two words) and a `big-word' is a sequence of
non-white-space characters.
.\"{{{  Special ksh vi commands
.IP "Special ksh vi commands"
The following commands are not in, or are different from, the normal vi file
editor:
.RS
.IP "\fIn\fP\fB_\fP"
insert a space followed by the \fIn\fPth big-word from the last command in the
history at the current position and enter insert mode; if \fIn\fP is not
specified, the last word is inserted.
.IP "\fB#\fP"
insert the comment character (\fB#\fP) at the start of the current line and
return the line to the shell (equivalent to \fBI#^J\fP).
.IP "\fIn\fP\fBg\fP"
like \fBG\fP, except if \fIn\fP is not specified, it goes to the most recent 
remembered line.
.IP "\fIn\fP\fBv\fP"
edit line \fIn\fP using the vi editor; 
if \fIn\fP is not specified, the current line is edited.
The actual command executed is
`\fBfc \-e ${VISUAL:-${EDITOR:-vi}}\fP \fIn\fP'.
.IP "\fB*\fP and \fB^X\fP"
command or file name expansion is applied to the current big-word
(with an appended *, if the word contains no file globing characters) - the
big-word is replaced with the resulting words.
If the current big-word is the first on the line (or follows one
of the following characters: \fB;\fP, \fB|\fP, \fB&\fP, \fB(\fP, \fB)\fP)
and does not contain a slash (\fB/\fP) then command expansion is done,
otherwise file name expansion is done.
Command expansion will match the big-word against all aliases, functions
and built-in commands as well as any executable files found by searching
the directories in the \fBPATH\fP parameter.
File name expansion matches the big-word against the files in the
current directory.
After expansion, the cursor is placed just past the last word and the editor
is in insert mode.
.IP "\fIn\fP\fB\e\fP, \fIn\fP\fB^F\fP, \fIn\fP\fB<tab>\fP and \fIn\fP\fB<esc>\fP"
command/file name completion: 
replace the current big-word with the longest unique
match obtained after performing command/file name expansion.
\fB<tab>\fP is only recognized if the \fBvi-tabcomplete\fP option is set,
while \fB<esc>\fP is only recognized if the \fBvi-esccomplete\fP option
is set (see \fBset \-o\fP).
If \fIn\fP is specified, the \fIn\fPth possible
completion is selected (as reported by the command/file name enumeration
command).
.IP "\fB=\fP and \fB^E\fP"
command/file name enumeration: list all the commands or files that match
the current big-word.
.IP "\fB^V\fP"
display the version of pdksh; it is displayed until another key is pressed
(this key is ignored).
.IP "\fB@\fP\fIc\fP"
macro expansion: execute the commands found in the alias _\fIc\fP.
