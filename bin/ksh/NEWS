    * errexit option (-e) ignored when reading profile and $ENV files.
    * test: '-x f' now fails for root if f is a file and has no x bits set.
    * $_: set to last arg in interactive shells only.
    * PATH: if $PATH not set on startup, it is set to the default path.
    * extended globbing: allow (pat|pat) within @(...) and ${foo#...} patterns.

    * cd: two argument form works again.
    * special commands taking assignments (alias,set,etc.): field splitting,
      file globbing, etc. suppressed only for args that look like assignments.
    * command: -V now finds reserved words.

* added support for Korn's /dev/fd tests

* new compile time option: DEFAULT_ENV - if defined, it names a file to
  include if $ENV is not set.

* test -o option: if option starts with a !, the test is negated.  The test
  always fails if the option doesn't exist (so [ -o foo -o -o !foo ] is true
  iff option foo exists).

* new option: set -o nohup (currently on by default) - if set, running jobs
  are not kill -HUP'd when a login shell exits; if clear, they are.  In
  future, this will be clear by default (to act like at&t ksh) - if you don't
  (won't) like this, add "[ -o !nohup ] && set -o nohup" to your .profile.

    * vi: set -o markdirs, directories and ^[= now get along.
    * cd: -P no longer leaves .. and . in PWD.
    * cd: if CDPATH set and can't cd, error doesn't contain any of CDPATH.
    * cd: sets PWD properly, on machines without getwd().
    * configuration: unistd.h test fixed (include sys/types before dirent.h).
    * configuration: detects memmove/bcopy's that don't handle overlaps.
    * [[ ... ]] does lazy evaluation (eg, [[ ! -f foo || $(<foo) = bar ]] does
      not evaluate $(<foo) if foo doesn't exist).

    * the exit value of set is that of the last $(...) on the command line.
    * ditto for a command with no command (eg, x=`false`).
    * command variable assignments done before path search (so PATH=... x works)
      and are added as they are processed (so A=1 B=$A works).
    * variable assignments infront of function calls are exported to programs
      inside the function.
    * aliases with trailing space are only honoured in command contexts
      if in posix mode.

* make depend target added; install target warns if ksh not in /etc/shells.

* at&t/posix $(( .. )) arithmetic expansions supported.

Version 5.0.1

* set -e no longer effects commands executed as part of if/while/until/&&/||/!
  condition.

    * fg,bg,jobs,wait,kill commands fully POSIX complient
    * signals are no longer reported for foreground jobs killed by SIGINT and
      SIGPIPE
    * pipeline process groups now created more reliablely (was a problem
      if first process exited before second process exec'd).
    * "(: ; cat /etc/termcap) | sleep" nolonger hangs

* save/restore tty mode if command succeeds/fails, respectively.  Edit
  mode (emacs,vi) no longer use old tty mode information

* test command: added -h

* alternations option renamed to braceexpand (eg, use set -o braceexpand).
  Old usage (set -o alternations) still accepted (will disappear in next
  version).

* trap/kill now accept upper and lower case signal names.

Version 4.9+mun.3

* here documents in functions now work properly

* read command: added -s option, use REPLY if no variable specified

* don't accept "while command; done" as a valid command

* fg,bg,jobs,wait,kill commands mostly POSIX complient.

* unset command: added POSIX -v option

* set command: added -A option

* handle ${array[@]} and ${array[*]}

* new versions of etc/profile and etc/ksh.profile

Version 4.9+mun.2 (versus 4.9)

* directory/file structure has been re-arranged:
    * moved files from sh directory up a level, deleted sh directory
    * created misc directory, old ChangeLog,README,.. files moved to misc

* now uses GNU autoconf for compilation.

* no longer uses stdio FILE *'s for I/O redirection (most stdio
  usage has been removed).  Solves many porting problems caused by
  dup'd file descriptors, forked processes and exiting.

* removed lint from code (compiles with very few warning with gcc -O -Wall
  -Wno-comment)

* has array support (needs work but is pretty functional).

* ulimit command now more functional on more machines. Compatable with at&t ksh.
