		     Notes on Adding a System Call

You must always commit syscalls.master before rebuilding the files, then
commit them separately so that the correct RCS stuff shows up in the
generated files.

Don't forget to increment the minor number of src/lib/libc/shlib_version
when adding a syscall.

		      Note on Adding a Sysctl Entry

Don't forget to add the entry to the sysctl(8) man page.
Don't forget to add the descripton to the sysctl(3) man page.
