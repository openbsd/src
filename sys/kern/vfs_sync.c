 * The workitem queue.
 *
 * It is useful to delay writes of file data and filesystem metadata
 * for tens of seconds so that quickly created and deleted files need
 * not waste disk bandwidth being created and removed. To realize this,
 * we append vnodes to a "workitem" queue. When running with a soft
 * updates implementation, most pending metadata dependencies should
 * not wait for more than a few seconds. Thus, mounted block devices
 * are delayed only about half the time that file data is delayed.
 * Similarly, directory updates are more critical, so are only delayed
 * about a third the time that file data is delayed. Thus, there are
 * SYNCER_MAXDELAY queues that are processed round-robin at a rate of
 * one each second (driven off the filesystem syncer process). The
 * syncer_delayno variable indicates the next queue that is to be processed.
 * Items that need to be processed soon are placed in this queue:
 *
 *	syncer_workitem_pending[syncer_delayno]
 *
 * A delay of fifteen seconds is done by placing the request fifteen
 * entries later in the queue:
 *
 *	syncer_workitem_pending[(syncer_delayno + 15) & syncer_mask]
 *
