 * UVM_OBJ_KERN is a 'special' uo_refs value which indicates that the

 * this value is used to detected kernel object mappings at uvm_unmap()
 * time.   normally when an object is unmapped its pages eventaully become
 * deactivated and then paged out and/or freed.    this is not useful
 * for kernel objects... when a kernel object is unmapped we always want
 * to free the resources associated with the mapping.   UVM_OBJ_KERN
 * allows us to decide which type of unmapping we want to do.
