 *
 *	LOCKING PROTOCOL NOTES:
 *	-----------------------
 *
 *	VM map locking is a little complicated.  There are both shared
 *	and exclusive locks on maps.  However, it is sometimes required
 *	to downgrade an exclusive lock to a shared lock, and upgrade to
 *	an exclusive lock again (to perform error recovery).  However,
 *	another thread *must not* queue itself to receive an exclusive
 *	lock while before we upgrade back to exclusive, otherwise the
 *	error recovery becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible.
 *
 *	In order to prevent this scenario, we introduce the notion of
 *	a `busy' map.  A `busy' map is read-locked, but other threads
 *	attempting to write-lock wait for this flag to clear before
 *	entering the lock manager.  A map may only be marked busy
 *	when the map is write-locked (and then the map must be downgraded
 *	to read-locked), and may only be marked unbusy by the thread
 *	which marked it busy (holding *either* a read-lock or a
 *	write-lock, the latter being gained by an upgrade).
 *
 *	Access to the map `flags' member is controlled by the `flags_lock'
 *	simple lock.  Note that some flags are static (set once at map
 *	creation time, and never changed), and thus require no locking
 *	to check those flags.  All flags which are r/w must be set or
 *	cleared while the `flags_lock' is asserted.  Additional locking
 *	requirements are:
 *
 *		VM_MAP_PAGEABLE		r/o static flag; no locking required
 *
 *		VM_MAP_INTRSAFE		r/o static flag; no locking required
 *
 *		VM_MAP_WIREFUTURE	r/w; may only be set or cleared when
 *					map is write-locked.  may be tested
 *					without asserting `flags_lock'.
 *
 *		VM_MAP_BUSY		r/w; may only be set when map is
 *					write-locked, may only be cleared by
 *					thread which set it, map read-locked
 *					or write-locked.  must be tested
 *					while `flags_lock' is asserted.
 *
 *		VM_MAP_WANTLOCK		r/w; may only be set when the map
 *					is busy, and thread is attempting
 *					to write-lock.  must be tested
 *					while `flags_lock' is asserted.
 *
 *		VM_MAP_GUARDPAGES	r/o; must be specified at map
 *					initialization time.
 *					If set, guards will appear between
 *					automatic allocations.
 *					No locking required.
 *
 *		VM_MAP_ISVMSPACE	r/o; set by uvmspace_alloc.
 *					Signifies that this map is a vmspace.
 *					(The implementation treats all maps
 *					without this bit as kernel maps.)
 *					No locking required.
 *
 *
 * All automatic allocations (uvm_map without MAP_FIXED) will allocate
 * from vm_map.free.
 * If that allocation fails:
 * - vmspace maps will spill over into vm_map.bfree,
 * - all other maps will call uvm_map_kmem_grow() to increase the arena.
 * 
 * vmspace maps have their data, brk() and stack arenas automatically
 * updated when uvm_map() is invoked without MAP_FIXED.
 * The spill over arena (vm_map.bfree) will contain the space in the brk()
 * and stack ranges.
 * Kernel maps never have a bfree arena and this tree will always be empty.
 *
 *
 * read_locks and write_locks are used in lock debugging code.
