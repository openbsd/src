.Dt INSTALLBOOT 8 sparc
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd install a bootstrap on an FFS filesystem partition
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl nvh
.Op Fl a Ar karch
.Ar boot
.Ar bootxx
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm installboot
prepares an FFS filesystem partition for boot-strapping from the PROM.
The sparc bootblocks are split into two parts: a small first-stage program that
is written into the superblock area in a partition
.Po
and hence is limited in size to SBSIZE - DEV_BSIZE bytes
.Pc ,
and a second-stage program that resides in the filesystem proper.
The first-stage program is loaded into memory by the PROM.
After it receives control, it loads the second stage program from a set of
filesystem block numbers that have been hard-coded into it by the
.Nm installboot
program.
The second-stage boot program uses the device driver interface to
the PROM and the stand-alone filesystem code in
.Dq libsa.a
to locate and load the kernel.
The second-stage boot program and the prototype code for the
first-stage bootprogram can be found in
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot
and
.Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx
respectively.
The second-stage program commonly resides in the root directory as
.Pa /boot .
The utility
.Pa /usr/mdec/binstall
can be used to properly copy the second-stage bootprogram to its destination.
This script takes care of post-processing that is required on
.Pf non- Tn Openboot
machines.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl a Ar karch
Set the machine architecture.
The argument
.Ar karch
can be one of
.Dq sun4 ,
.Dq sun4c
or
.Dq sun4m .
Sun 4c models with
.Tn Openboot
PROMs need the header to be present, while Sun 4 systems with the
.Dq old monitor
interface require the header to be stripped off.
This is normally taken care of by
.Nm installboot
automatically, but it's useful when preparing a bootable filesystem for
another system.
.It Fl h
Leave the
.Xr a.out 5
header on the installed
.Ar bootxx
program.
This option has been superseded by the
.Fl a Ar karch
option.
.It Fl n
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width bootxx
.It Ar boot
the name of the second-stage boot program in the file system
where the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
.It Ar bootxx
the name of the prototype file for the first stage boot program.
.It Ar device
the name of the raw device in which the first-stage boot program
is to be installed.
This should correspond to the block device on which the file system containing
.Ar boot
is mounted.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will install the first-stage bootblocks in the
root filesystem
.Pq assumed to be mounted on Dq sd0a
using the file
.Pa /boot
as the second-level boot program:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
installboot /boot /usr/mdec/bootxx /dev/rsd0a
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr init 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm installboot
first appeared in
.Nx 1.1 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm installboot
requires simultaneous access to the mounted file system and
the raw device, but that is not allowed with the kernel
.Dv securelevel
variable set to a value greater than zero
.Pq the default ,
so
.Nm installboot
only works in single-user mode
.Pq or insecure mode - see Xr init 8 .
