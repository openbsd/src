Here is a list of hp300 specific kernel compilation options and what they
mean:

HP320
	Support for old hp320 machines: 16mhz 68020, HP MMU, 16mhz 68881
	and VAC.  Compiles in support for a VAC, HP MMU, and the 98620A
	16-bit DMA channel.

HP350
	Support for old hp350 machines: 25mhz 68020, HP MMU, 20mhz 68881
	and VAC.  Compiles in support for a VAC and the HP MMU.  Differs
	from HP320 in that it has no support for 16-bit DMA controller.

HP330
	Support for old hp330 (and 318/319) machines: 16mhz 68020, 68551 PMMU
	and 16mhz 68881.  Compiles in support for PMMU.

HP340
HP360
	Support for old 340 and hp360 machines: 25mhz 68030+MMU and 25mhz
	68882.  Compiles in support for PMMU and 68030.  Differs from HP330
	in support for 68030 on-chip data cache.

HP370
	Support for old hp370 (and current 345/375/400) machines: 33 (50) mhz
	68030+MMU and 33 (50) mhz 68882.  Compiles in support for PMMU, 68030
	and off-chip physically addressed cache.  Differs from 360 in only one
	place, in dealing with flushing the external cache.

HP380
HP385
	Support for "current" hp380/425/385/433 machines: 25 (33) mhz 68040
	with MMU/FPU.  Compiles in support for 68040.

FPSP
	Compiles in support to link with Motorola's 68040 FP emulation
	library.  Kernel will build and run without this option, but many
	binaries will core dump.  Should not be defined unless HP380 is.


USELEDS
	Twinkle the hp4xx front panel (or hp3xx internal) LEDs in the HP
	designated way.  Somewhat frivolous, but the heartbeat LED is
	useful to see if your machine is alive.

DEBUG
	Compiles in a variety of consistency checks and debug printfs
	throughout the hp300 MD code and device drivers.

COMPAT_HPUX
	Enables HP-UX binary compatibility mode.  Allows a variety of
	"recent" HP-UX binaries to be run unchanged.  Due to the
	evolutionary and "as-needed" nature of this code, "recent" is
	anywhere from release 6.2 to 8.0 of HP-UX.  It will run 8.0
	shared-library binaries (assuming all the necessary shared-libraries
	are installed in the filesystem).

DCMSTATS
	Compile in code to collect a variety of transmit/receive statistics
	for the 98642 4-port MUX.

WAITHIST
	Compile in code to collect statistics about the distribution of
	wait-times for various busy waits in the SCSI host-adaptor driver.

SCSI_REVPRI
	Changes autoconf to start matching logical SCSI devices starting
	at slave 6 and working backwards instead of starting at slave 0
	and working up.  Later releases of the HP boot ROM search for
	boot devices in this manner.  This is apparently the order in
	which priority is given to slaves on the host adaptor.  Define
	this if you use wildcarding and want to stay in sync with the
	boot ROM's strategy.

MAPPEDCOPY
	Use page remapping to do large copyin/copyouts.  When defined
	the default is to use mapped copy for operations on one page
	or more except on machines with virtually-indexed caches.
	See initcpu() in machdep.c
