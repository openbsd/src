.Os OpenBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm isolif
.Nd make an ISO9660 filesystem bootable on an hp300
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /usr/mdec/isolif
.Op Fl a
.Fl s Ar isostart
.Fl e Ar isoend
.Fl n Ar name
.Fl r Ar rawfile
.Fl o Ar output
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm isolif
writes an appriopate LIF header to an ISO9660 filesystem, making it bootable
an hp300.
.Pp
The ISO9660 filesystem must contain a
.Em raw
hp300 boot block file; this is normally found in
.Pa /usr/mdec/uboot.raw .
The position of that file within the ISO9660 filesystem image is then passed
to
.Nm
and a LIF header is output to a file (which may be the actual ISO9660
filesystem).  When written to a CD or other media, this filesystem is then
bootable.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width XxXXXXXXXXX
.It Fl a
The
.Fl a
flag specifies that
.Nm
should not truncate it's output file; this allows the output file to be
the actual ISO9660 filesystem image.
.It Fl s Ar isostart
The
.Fl s
option specifies the begining block in the ISO9660 filesystem of the
.Em raw
bootblock file.
.It Fl e Ar isoend
.Fl e
specifies the ending block number of the boot block file.  Both
.Fl s
and
.Fl e
values are taken from the verbose output of
.Xr mkisofs 8 .
.It Fl n Ar name
The
.Fl n
option specifies the name of the boot block within the LIF header; this will
be displayed by the ROM at boot time, in all capital letters and with
.Dq SYS_
prepended.
.It Fl r Ar rawfile
The name of the
.Em raw
boot file must be specified; data is required from it's header in order to
build the LIF header.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
This specifies the output file name for the LIF header.  Normally it is
created if needed and truncated.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl e
option is not currently actually used by the program.
