### current open projects and assignments by area:

hardware and installation notes (distrib/notes/hppa/*):	fries@
* wip, will flesh out as development progresses
* For now have rbootd running on the server, boot.lif from hppa.fries.net,
    and then:
         <esc> on bootup, a to get to BOOT_ADMIN prompt, and finally,
         BOOT_ADMIN> boot lan isl

hardware manuals (man4.hppa/*):				mickey@
* ie manual
* siop manual
* hil manual
* add more to lasi and asp (also wax when studied enough)

boots (sys/arch/hppa/stand/*):				mickey@ miod@
* almost could be considered working/done, fixes and such (;

kernel (sys/arch/hppa/*):				mickey@
* arc4random() gets initialized from the same unticking prom clock value
  might be that either the inittodr() is broken or nfs boot pinches it
  too early before anything happens
* mount_nfs, stty do wrong things (perhaps same issue)
* reboot garbages the console
* clkf_intr() is not accurate, but we can mark any
  inner frame by looking at the top-level one in tlabel(all)
* several harware problems (ie disfunctional/untested drivers)
* wscons devices (hil/*, pckbc/*) unfinished
* 7300lc-based machines, 8k-based machines
* dino pci bridge support (found on 7300lc machines, FE)
* "original snakes" (700,705,710,...) support
* harmony audio driver
* isa/eisa dma
* TMS380 token-ring driver
* general cleanup (far-east future)
* hpux emulation

ramdisk development edition (distrib/hppa/*):		mickey@
* basic environment done (not in the repo)
* requires libc and kernel-user support

userland (*):						mickey@
* libc_r done (not verified)
* libkvm (awaits her kernel counterpart)
* shared libs support

X11 (X11/*):						fries@ mickey@
* patch is available, nothing to run at tho (;
