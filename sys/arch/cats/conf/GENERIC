# GENERIC machine description file
#
# This machine description file is used to generate the default OpenBSD
# kernel.  The generic kernel does not include all options, subsystems
# and device drivers, but should be useful for most applications.
#
# The machine description file can be customised for your specific
# machine to reduce the kernel size and improve its performance.
#
# For further information on compiling OpenBSD kernels, see the config(8)
# man page.
#
# For further information on hardware support for this architecture, see
# the intro(4) man page.  For further information about kernel options
# for this architecture, see the options(4) man page.  For an explanation
# of each device driver in this file see the section 4 man page for the
# device.

# PCI IDE Controllers and Devices
# PCI IDE controllers - see pciide(4) for supported hardware.
# The 0x0001 flag force the driver to use DMA, even if the driver doesn't know
# how to set up DMA modes for this chip. This may work, or may cause
# a machine hang with some controllers.
pciide* at pci? flags 0x0000

# IDE drives
# Flags are used only with controllers that support DMA operations
# and mode settings (e.g. some pciide controllers)
# The lowest order four bits (rightmost digit) of the flags define the PIO
# mode to use, the next set of four bits the DMA mode and the third set the
# UltraDMA mode. For each set of four bits, the 3 lower bits define the mode
# to use, and the last bit must be 1 for this setting to be used.
# For DMA and UDMA, 0xf (1111) means 'disable'.
# 0x0fac means 'use PIO mode 4, DMA mode 2, disable UltraDMA'.
# (0xc=1100, 0xa=1010, 0xf=1111)
# 0x0000 means "use whatever the drive claims to support".
