.Nd display or initialize DG/UX disk volume information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vdmtool
.Op Fl iv
.Ar rawdev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm vdmtool
displays
.\" rather crude
information about the DG/UX volume information found on a disk.

a bootable device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width rawdev
.It Fl i
Do not display volume information, but initialize a "boot area" instead.
This will overwrite the first sector of the disk with a valid boot area
descriptor, which declares the first 251KB of the disk as a boot area.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose, printing out VDIT sector information, as well as any
unparsed byte in the VDIT structures.
.It Ar rawdev
The name of the raw disk device to operate upon.
It may be abbreviated into a form recognizable by
.Xr opendev 3 .
