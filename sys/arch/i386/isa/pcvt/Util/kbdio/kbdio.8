.Sh NAME
.Nm kbdio
.Nd perform input/output on a PC keyboard/keyboard controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kbdio
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl f Ar devname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Purpose
.Nm Kbdio
is used to perform input/output on a PC keyboard or the
.Pq motherboard
keyboard controller.
.Nm Kbdio
cares for proper handshaking and necessary IO-ready conditions.  It
allows the interpretion of some registers in symbolic form, as well as
to specify symbolic operands for the keyboard command byte.  Simple
arithmetic expressions can be formed to set or reset some bits, which
is mostly applicable to the keyboard command byte, too.

.Ss Options
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset indent -compact
.It Fl d
Turn on the grammar parser debugger.

.It Fl f Ar devname
Operate on device
.Ar devname
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/console .
.El

.Ss Command language
The command language of
.Nm
constitutes of some very simple tokens and rules. Commands are executed
line by line as they are entered. Each line may contain any number of
semicolon-separated statements.

The list of acceptable statements includes:
.Bl -tag -width "TYPEMATIC" -indent offset -compact

.It Li \&?
.It Li help
Give help on the general syntax.

.It Li help expr
Help on expression syntax.

.It Li status \&?
Report keyboard controller status.

.It Li what \&?
Determine
.Tn MCA
type 1 or type 2 keyboard controller.

.It Li data \&?
Fetch keyboard controller data port.

.It Li led \&= Ar number
Set keyboard LEDs.
.Ar Number
is a logical combination of
.Bl -hang -width "4" -compact
.It 1
scroll lock LED
.It 2
num lock LED
.It 4
caps lock LED.
.El

.It Li echo
Send keyboard
.Li ECHO
command.

.It Li scan \&= Ar number
Turn keyboard to generate scan codes according to code set
.Ar number .
Only supported on
.Tn PS/2
style keyboards.

.It Li scan \&?
Report code set keyboard is currently operating in.

.It Li \&id \&?
Ask keyboard to report its identification bytes

.It Xo
.Li typematic \&= Ar number1 Li \&, Ar number2
.Xc
Set keyboard typematic delay and repeat rate to
.Ar number1
milliseconds and
.Ar number2
repeats per second, respectively.

.It Li enable
Enable keyboard.

.It Li defaults
Return customizable parameters to defaults.

.It Li all typematic
Set all keys to
.Em typematic
behaviour.  This command as well as the following ones are only
supported on
.Tn PS/2
style keyboards and only while operating in scan code set 3.

.It Li all make release
Turn all keys in generating
.Em make
and
.Em release
events only.

.It Li all make only
Turn all keys in generating
.Em make
codes only.

.It Li all typematic make release
Set all keys to generate
.Em make
and
.Em release
events, as well as perform
.Em typematic
behaviour.  This is usually the default.

.It Ar number Li typematic
Set key
.Ar number
to
.Em typematic
behaviour.

.It Ar number Li make release
Turn a single key
.Ar number
to generate
.Em make
and
.Em release
events only.

.It Ar number Li make only
Set key
.Ar number
to return
.Em make
events only.

.It Li resend
Ask the keyboard to retransmit its last character.

.It Li reset
Perform a keyboard
.Li RESET
command.

.It Li cmd \&?
Get the keyboard command byte and interpret it symbolically.

.It Li cmd \&= Ar expr
Set the keyboard command byte to
.Ar expr .
See the next subsection for expression syntax.
.El

Returned data will be printed hexadecimal, but any queued keyboard
control responses will be printed first.

.Ss Expression syntax
Expressions can either consist of a number, possibly followed
by a
.Sq +
or
.Sq \-
sign and bit values in numeric or symbolic form.
Symbolic bit values are
.Pq with their meaning in the keyboard command byte :

.Bl -tag -width "ovrinh" -offset indent -compact

.It Li scconv
value
.Li 0x40 ,
enable PC scan code conversion at
.Em controller
level, as opposed to the different keyboard scan code sets;

.It Li ignpar
value
.Li 0x20 ,
ignore keyboard parity;

.It Li clklow
value
.Li 0x10 ,
hold keyboard clock line low
.Pq disables keyboard ;

.It Li ovrinh
value
.Li 0x08 ,
override keyboard inhibit function -- ignore the keyboard lockout switch,
intented to allow the keyboard self-test;

.It Li test
value
.Li 0x04 ,
controller self-test okay;

.It Li irq
value
.Li 0x01 ,
enable generation of
.Li IRQ1
if output buffer is full.
.El

The operators
.Sq +
and
.Sq \-
perform simple bit-set or bit-clear functionality, respectively.  This
is roughly comparable with the operators
.Sq \&|
and
.Sq \&&~
in
.Em C .

Expressions are evaluated left to right and cannot be bracketed.
The special keyword
.Li cmd
is substituted by a read of the current keyboard command byte.

.Ss Access control
The caller must have uid 0 in order to gain the required access to
the IO registers.

.Sh EXAMPLES

.Dl led=3

Turn on num lock and scroll lock LEDs.

.Dl "cmd = cmd - irq; id?; cmd = cmd + irq"

Temporarily suspend keyboard interrupt generation, and ask the
keyboard to return its identification bytes.

.Sh FILES
.Pa /dev/console
is used as the default device to enable access to the IO registers.

.Sh HISTORY
This program is considered
.Dq hackware .
It has been developed in order to simplify the process of developing other
software that needs to handle the PC keyboard, and to give a very basic
aid in debugging keyboard-related problems.

.Sh AUTHOR
The program has been contributed by
.if n Joerg Wunsch,
.if t J\(:org Wunsch,
Dresden
.Aq joerg_wunsch@uriah.heep.sax.de .

.Sh BUGS
No useful diagnostics are printed in case of a syntax error.

Remember, to use this program, your kernel has to be compiled with XSERVER
being defined.

Use of this program might cause grievous harm to your system's sanity,
not only that it might hang your keyboard and/or keyboard controller
indefinitely, it might also hard-reset your system when accidentally
accessing the hardware reset facility of the keyboard controller
.Po
which does not actually belong there, but used to be
.Pc .

It is highly recommended to use this program only when logged into the
machine across a network or on a serial line.
