	$NetBSD: README,v 1.9 1995/09/16 12:00:21 ragge Exp $

Devices supported in kernel and _known_ to work:
CPU:	VAX 11/750 with 2-14MB of memory.
	KA630 (MicroVAX II) with 2-16 MB memory.

Net:	DEUNA/DELUA Unibus ethernet cards.
	DEQNA/DELQA Q22 bus ethernet cards.

Disks:	UDA50 Unibus MSCP controller.
	KDA50/RQDX3 Q22 bus MSCP controller.
		RA??-disks on UDA50 or KDA50.
		RD??-disks on RQDX3. (known as RA?? by system).

Tapes:	DILOG Q22 bus tape ctlr w/ Exabyte. (TMSCP emulating)
	TSV05 Q22 bus tape ctlr.
	TK50 (TMSCP) on Q22 bus.
		Other TMSCP ctlrs may also work, but haven't tried.


To install and run NetBSD/vax you need a MicroVAX II or VAX 11/750
with at least 4MB of memory, and a usable install media. Supported
install media is TK50 tape and RX33/RX50 floppy. If you do initial
installation from floppy then you need a way to load the rest of
the system, like tape or ethernet. 
NOTE! TU58 INSTALLATION IS NOT YET SUPPORTED, BUT WILL BE.

Actually, the system will run fine on only 2MB of memory, but
installation program needs 4MB. If this causes trouble for someone
tell me and I'll fix it.

Differences between the NetBSD/vax port and other ports:
 * It uses gcc 2.7.0 as default compiler.
 * libm is not the same as the other ports; instead it is 4.4BSD libm. 
 * No dynamic linked libraries, all binaries is statically linked.
These things will be fixed in the future.


We who have done parts of the VAX port is:
	Joachim Isaksson, first pmap and lots of help with gcc functionality.
	Mattias Gr|nlund, locore assembler and interrupt handling.
	Mattias ]slund, lots of help and ideas everywhere.
	Bertram Barth, bootblocks and boot routines for MicroVAX.
	Rick Macklem, fixed all MicroVAX II, TMSCP and DEQNA support.
	Anders Magnusson (ragge), that's me, who put things together
		and wrote the rest.

Have fun with it,
