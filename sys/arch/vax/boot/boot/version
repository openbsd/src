NOTE ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THE BOOTBLOCKS HERE.  The format of this
file is important - make sure the entries are appended on end, last item
is taken as the current.

1.0:	Initial import.
1.1:	Bunch of small fixes to make boot work on most VAXen.
1.2:	Use common routines to identify cpu type.
	Set up a SCB to be able to handle clock interrupts in the boot program.
	Now timer countdown should work on all types of vaxen.
1.3:	Unify the ra and tmscp driver.
	Standalone driver for the Digital Equipment Unibus Network Adapter
	(DEUNA). This allows 11/750 owners to install from a single TU58
	cassette.
	Adapt to the RPB changes. Complete change of how network devices are
	handled. No more hacks to find bus addresses.
1.5:	Standalone device driver for DEBNx (ni) ethernet controllers.
1.6:	Add support for VAX 6000 + VAX 8000. Tweak console routines.
	Create a fake RPB if either netbooted (on machine without RPB) or
	loaded from console storage (without VMB intervention).
1.7:	Add support for loading a 2nd stage boot in either a.out or ELF.
	Add support for loading a 2nd stage boot directly to its desired
	address if possible.
	Cleanup use of u_int/size_t.
1.8:	Switch to loadfile instead of exec.  Now we can load a.out or ELF
	kernels. (disabled in OpenBSD)
1.9:	Support verbose/quiet boot.
1.10:	Remove the 11/750 pcs code and the list of kernels to try to boot
	in order.
	Work around some PROM bugs in graphics mode which cause \h and \t not
	to behave as expected.
1.11:	Better VXT2000{,+} support.
1.12:	Glass console support on VXT2000{,+}.
1.13:	Enable the loadfile code added in revision 1.8.
1.14:	Support for VaxStation 3[58][24]0.
1.15:	Restore boot sd()... functionality on machines with asc(4) or sii(4)
	controllers.
