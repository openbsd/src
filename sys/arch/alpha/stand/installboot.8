.Dt INSTALLBOOT 8
.Os 
.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd install bootstrap software on an FFS partition
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl nv
.Ar boot
.Ar bootxx
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm installboot
utility prepares an FFS partition for bootstrapping.
.Pp
The NetBSD/alpha disk bootstrap software is split into two parts:
a small first-stage boot program that is written into the disklabel
area of a disk
.Po
and hence is limited in size to 7680 bytes
.Pc ,
and a second-stage boot program that resides in the filesystem proper
.Po
typically with the name 
.Pa /boot
.Pc .
The first-stage boot program is loaded into memory by the SRM console
software.  After receiving control of the system, it loads the
second-stage boot program from a set of filesystem block numbers that
have been
hard-coded into it by
.Nm installboot .
The second-stage boot program locates and loads the kernel.
.Pp
The second-stage boot program and the prototype code for the
first-stage boot program can be found in
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot
and
.Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx ,
respectively.
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot
may be installed simply by copying it to the root directory of the
partition you wish to boot from, but after it is installed
.Nm installboot
.Em must
be run.
.Pp
The options recognized by
.Nm installboot
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl n
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width bootxx
.It Ar boot
The name of the second-stage boot program in the file system
where the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
.It Ar bootxx
The name of the prototype file for the first-stage boot program.
.It Ar device
The name of the raw device in which the first-stage boot program
is to be installed.  
This should be the raw device containing the file system
which holds
.Ar boot .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will install the first-stage boot program in the
root filesystem
.Pq assumed to be mounted from Dq sd0a
using the file
.Pa /boot
as the second-stage boot program:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
installboot /boot /usr/mdec/bootxx /dev/rsd0a
.Ed
.Sh BUGS
NetBSD/alpha systems are only capable of booting off of disks'
.Dq a
partitions, and bootable partitions must start at the beginning
of the disk.
.Pp
.Nm Installboot
requires simultaneous access to the mounted file system and
the raw device.
That is not allowed with the kernel
.Dv securelevel
variable
.Po
see
.Xr sysctl 8
.Pc
set to a value greater than zero, so
.Nm installboot
only works when the system is in
an insecure mode (e.g. single-user mode; see
.Xr init 8 ).
.Sh "SEE ALSO"
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The NetBSD/alpha
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.2 .
