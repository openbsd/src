/*
 *
 * Interface Send Queues
 *
 * struct ifqueue sits between the network stack and a drivers
 * transmission of packets. The high level view is that when the stack
 * has finished generating a packet it hands it to a driver for
 * transmission. It does this by queueing the packet on an ifqueue and
 * notifying the driver to start transmission of the queued packets.
 *
 * A network device may have multiple contexts for the transmission
 * of packets, ie, independent transmit rings. An network device
 * represented by a struct ifnet may have multiple ifqueue structures,
 * each of which represents an independent context.
 *
 * struct ifqueue also provides the point where conditioning of
 * traffic (ie, priq and hfsc) is implemented, and provides some
 * infrastructure to assist in the implementation of network drivers.
 *
 * = ifq API
 *
 * The ifq API provides functions for three distinct consumers:
 *
 * 1. The network stack
 * 2. Traffic QoS/conditioning implementations
 * 3. Network drivers
 *
 * == Network Stack API
 *
 * The network stack is responsible for initialising and destroying
 * the ifqueue structures, changing the traffic conditioner on an
 * interface, enqueuing packets for transmission, and notifying
 * the driver to start transmission of a particular ifqueue.
 *
 * === ifq_init()
 *
 * During if_attach(), the network stack calls ifq_init to initialise
 * the ifqueue structure. By default it configures the priq traffic
 * conditioner.
 *
 * === ifq_destroy()
 *
 * The network stack calls ifq_destroy() during if_detach to tear down
 * the ifqueue structure. It frees the traffic conditioner state, and
 * frees any mbufs that were left queued.
 *
 * === ifq_attach()
 *
 * ifq_attach() is used to replace the current traffic conditioner on
 * the ifqueue. All the pending mbufs are removed from the previous
 * conditioner and requeued on the new.
 *
 * === ifq_idx()
 *
 * ifq_idx() selects a specific ifqueue from the current ifnet
 * structure for use in the transmission of the mbuf.
 *
 * === ifq_enqueue()
 *
 * ifq_enqueue() attempts to fit an mbuf onto the ifqueue. The
 * current traffic conditioner may drop a packet to make space on the
 * queue.
 *
 * === ifq_start()
 *
 * Once a packet has been successfully queued with ifq_enqueue(),
 * the network card is notified with a call to ifq_start().
 * Calls to ifq_start() run in the ifqueue serialisation context,
 * guaranteeing that only one instance of ifp->if_qstart() will be
 * running on behalf of a specific ifqueue in the system at any point
 * in time.
 *
 * == Traffic conditioners API
 *
 * The majority of interaction between struct ifqueue and a traffic
 * conditioner occurs via the callbacks a traffic conditioner provides
 * in an instance of struct ifq_ops.
 *
 * XXX document ifqop_*
 *
 * The ifqueue API implements the locking on behalf of the conditioning
 * implementations so conditioners only have to reject or keep mbufs.
 * If something needs to inspect a conditioners internals, the queue lock
 * needs to be taken to allow for a consistent or safe view. The queue
 * lock may be taken and released with ifq_q_enter() and ifq_q_leave().
 *
 * === ifq_q_enter()
 *
 * Code wishing to access a conditioners internals may take the queue
 * lock with ifq_q_enter(). The caller must pass a reference to the
 * conditioners ifq_ops structure so the infrastructure can ensure the
 * caller is able to understand the internals. ifq_q_enter() returns
 * a pointer to the conditions internal structures, or NULL if the
 * ifq_ops did not match the current conditioner.
 *
 * === ifq_q_leave()
 *
 * The queue lock acquired with ifq_q_enter() is released with
 * ifq_q_leave().
 *
 * === ifq_mfreem() and ifq_mfreeml()
 *
 * A goal of the API is to avoid freeing an mbuf while mutexs are
 * held. Because the ifq API manages the lock on behalf of the backend
 * ifqops, the backend should not directly free mbufs. If a conditioner
 * backend needs to drop a packet during the handling of ifqop_deq_begin,
 * it may free it by calling ifq_mfreem(). This accounts for the drop,
 * and schedules the free of the mbuf outside the hold of ifq_mtx.
 * ifq_mfreeml() takes an mbuf list as an argument instead.
 *
 *
 * == Network Driver API
 *
 * The API used by network drivers is mostly documented in the
 * ifq_dequeue(9) manpage except for ifq_serialize(),
 * ifq_is_serialized(), and IFQ_ASSERT_SERIALIZED().
 *
 * === ifq_serialize()
 *
 * A driver may run arbitrary work in the ifqueue serialiser context
 * via ifq_serialize(). The work to be done is represented by a task
 * that has been prepared with task_set.
 *
 * The work will be run in series with any other work dispatched by
 * ifq_start(), ifq_restart(), or other ifq_serialize() calls.
 *
 * Because the work may be run on another CPU, the lifetime of the
 * task and the work it represents can extend beyond the end of the
 * call to ifq_serialize() that dispatched it.
 *
 * === ifq_is_serialized()
 *
 * This function returns whether the caller is currently within the
 * ifqueue serializer context.
 *
 * === IFQ_ASSERT_SERIALIZED()
 *
 * This macro will assert that the caller is currently within the
 * specified ifqueue serialiser context.
 *
 *
 * = ifqueue work serialisation
 *
 * ifqueues provide a mechanism to dispatch work to be run in a single
 * context. Work in this mechanism is represtented by task structures.
 *
 * The tasks are run in a context similar to a taskq serviced by a
 * single kernel thread, except the work is run immediately by the
 * first CPU that dispatches work. If a second CPU attempts to dispatch
 * additional tasks while the first is still running, it will be queued
 * to be run by the first CPU. The second CPU will return immediately.
 *
 * = MP Safe Network Drivers
 *
 * An MP safe network driver is one in which its start routine can be
 * called by the network stack without holding the big kernel lock.
 *
 * == Attach
 *
 * A driver advertises it's ability to run its start routine without
 * the kernel lock by setting the IFXF_MPSAFE flag in ifp->if_xflags
 * before calling if_attach(). Advertising an MPSAFE start routine
 * also implies that the driver understands that a network card can
 * have multiple rings or transmit queues, and therefore provides
 * if_qstart function (which takes an ifqueue pointer) instead of an
 * if_start function (which takes an ifnet pointer).
 *
 *	void	drv_start(struct ifqueue *);
 *
 *	void
 *	drv_attach()
 *	{
 *	...
 *		ifp->if_xflags = IFXF_MPSAFE;
 *		ifp->if_qstart = drv_start;
 *		if_attach(ifp);
 *	}
 *
 * The network stack will then call ifp->if_qstart via ifq_start()
 * to guarantee there is only one instance of that function running
 * in the system and to serialise it with other work the driver may
 * provide.
 *
 * == Initialise
 *
 * When the stack requests an interface be brought up (ie, drv_ioctl()
 * is called to handle SIOCSIFFLAGS with IFF_UP set in ifp->if_flags)
 * drivers should set IFF_RUNNING in ifp->if_flags and call
 * ifq_clr_oactive().
 *
 * == if_start
 *
 * ifq_start() checks that IFF_RUNNING is set in ifp->if_flags, that
 * ifq_is_oactive() does not return true, and that there are pending
 * packets to transmit via a call to ifq_len(). Therefore, drivers are
 * no longer responsible for doing this themselves.
 *
 * If a driver should not transmit packets while its link is down, use
 * ifq_purge() to flush pending packets from the transmit queue.
 *
 * Drivers for hardware should use the following pattern to transmit
 * packets:
 *
 *	void
 *	drv_start(struct ifqueue *ifq)
 *	{
 *		struct ifnet *ifp = ifq->ifq_if;
 *		struct drv_softc *sc = ifp->if_softc;
 *		struct mbuf *m;
 *		int kick = 0;
 *
 *		if (NO_LINK) {
 *			ifq_purge(ifq);
 *			return;
 *		}
 *
 *		for (;;) {
 *			if (NO_SPACE) {
 *				ifq_set_oactive(ifq);
 *				break;
 *			}
 *
 *			m = ifq_dequeue(ifq);
 *			if (m == NULL)
 *				break;
 *
 *			if (drv_encap(sc, m) != 0) { // map and fill ring
 *				m_freem(m);
 *				continue;
 *			}
 *
 *			bpf_mtap();
 *		}
 *
 *		drv_kick(sc); // notify hw of new descriptors on the ring
 *	 }
 *
 * == Transmission completion
 *
 * The following pattern should be used for transmit queue interrupt
 * processing:
 *
 *	void
 *	drv_txeof(struct ifqueue *ifq)
 *	{
 *		while (COMPLETED_PKTS) {
 *			// unmap packets, m_freem() the mbufs.
 *		}
 *
 *		if (ifq_is_oactive(ifq))
 *			ifq_restart(ifq);
 *	}
 *
 * == Stop
 *
 * Bringing an interface down (ie, IFF_UP was cleared in ifp->if_flags)
 * should clear IFF_RUNNING in ifp->if_flags, and guarantee the start
 * routine is not running before freeing any resources it uses:
 *
 *	void
 *	drv_down(struct drv_softc *sc)
 *	{
 *		struct ifnet *ifp = &sc->sc_if;
 *		struct ifqueue *ifq;
 *		int i;
 *
 *		CLR(ifp->if_flags, IFF_RUNNING);
 *		DISABLE_INTERRUPTS();
 *
 *		for (i = 0; i < sc->sc_num_queues; i++) {
 * 			ifq = ifp->if_ifqs[i];
 *			ifq_barrier(ifq);
 *		}
 *
 *		intr_barrier(sc->sc_ih);
 *
 *		FREE_RESOURCES();
 *
 *		for (i = 0; i < sc->sc_num_queues; i++) {
 * 			ifq = ifp->if_ifqs[i];
 *			ifq_clr_oactive(ifq);
 *		}
 *	}
 *
