Please refrain from making too much changes to sys/netinet6 tree (even if
cosmetic), as we (KAME team) shares these code in all KAME/*BSD.  If you
keep the tree untouched, that will help us upgrade to more recent KAME tree.


Things we can do with the current code:
- ip6 layer
	ip6 output, ip6 input
- icmp6 layer
	replies to ping, DAD
- raw6 socket input/output
- tcp6 socket input/output (both daemon and client)
- udp6 socket input/output (need more testing)
- "options IPSEC" compiles (enabled by default in sys/conf/files), but
  it means OpenBSD IPsec for IPv4 only.  Efforts are ongoing to support IPv6
  with OpenBSD IPsec.
- hoplimit control advapi works fine.
- works just fine on i386 and sparc.

Things we can't do with the current code:
- setsockopt(), ioctl and advapi needs more checking
- check advanced APIs (both userland and kernel)
- multicast related items need checking
- ip6_output() does not consult /128 routes, and will not obey icmp6 redir.
- ssh6 port does not work on sparc (ssh does not work.  sshd works fine - why?)
- NIS IPv6 name lookup compatibility with Solaris 2.8 (ipnodes.byname).
  currently NIS will be looked up only for IPv4 names.

Cleanup todo:
- organize kame/sys/netinet6/in6_src.c and kame/sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c better
  for maximum code sharing.
- nuke unnecessary #ifdef in NRL tcp/udp layer, for more readability
	(is it okay to do it?)
- security auditing :-)
- tcp/udp/raw socket code has too many #ifdefs
