/*
 * Computers are very predictable devices.  Hence it is extremely hard
 * to produce truly random numbers on a computer --- as opposed to
 * pseudo-random numbers, which can be easily generated by using an
 * algorithm.  Unfortunately, it is very easy for attackers to guess
 * the sequence of pseudo-random number generators, and for some
 * applications this is not acceptable.  Instead, we must try to
 * gather "environmental noise" from the computer's environment, which
 * must be hard for outside attackers to observe and use to
 * generate random numbers.  In a Unix environment, this is best done
 * from inside the kernel.
 *
 * Sources of randomness from the environment include inter-keyboard
 * timings, inter-interrupt timings from some interrupts, and other
 * events which are both (a) non-deterministic and (b) hard for an
 * outside observer to measure.  Randomness from these sources is
 * added to the "rnd states" queue; this is used as much of the
 * source material which is mixed on occasion using a CRC-like function
 * into the "entropy pool".  This is not cryptographically strong, but
 * it is adequate assuming the randomness is not chosen maliciously,
 * and it very fast because the interrupt-time event is only to add
 * a small random token to the "rnd states" queue.
 *
 * When random bytes are desired, they are obtained by pulling from
 * the entropy pool and running a SHA512 hash. The SHA512 hash avoids
 * exposing the internal state of the entropy pool.  Even if it is
 * possible to analyze SHA512 in some clever way, as long as the amount
 * of data returned from the generator is less than the inherent
 * entropy in the pool, the output data is totally unpredictable.  For
 * this reason, the routine decreases its internal estimate of how many
 * bits of "true randomness" are contained in the entropy pool as it
 * outputs random numbers.
 *
 * If this estimate goes to zero, the SHA512 hash will continue to generate
 * output since there is no true risk because the SHA512 output is not
 * exported outside this subsystem.  It is next used as input to seed a
 * ChaCha20 stream cipher, which is re-seeded from time to time.  This
 * design provides very high amounts of output data from a potentially
 * small entropy base, at high enough speeds to encourage use of random
 * numbers in nearly any situation.  Before OpenBSD 5.5, the RC4 stream
 * cipher (also known as ARC4) was used instead of ChaCha20.
 *
 * The output of this single ChaCha20 engine is then shared amongst many
 * consumers in the kernel and userland via a few interfaces:
 * arc4random_buf(), arc4random(), arc4random_uniform(), randomread()
 * for the set of /dev/random nodes, the sysctl kern.arandom, and the
 * system call getentropy(), which provides seeds for process-context
 * pseudorandom generators.
 *
 * Acknowledgements:
 * =================
 *
 * Ideas for constructing this random number generator were derived
 * from Pretty Good Privacy's random number generator, and from private
 * discussions with Phil Karn.  Colin Plumb provided a faster random
 * number generator, which speeds up the mixing function of the entropy
 * pool, taken from PGPfone.  Dale Worley has also contributed many
 * useful ideas and suggestions to improve this driver.
 *
 * Any flaws in the design are solely my responsibility, and should
 * not be attributed to the Phil, Colin, or any of the authors of PGP.
 *
 * Further background information on this topic may be obtained from
 * RFC 1750, "Randomness Recommendations for Security", by Donald
 * Eastlake, Steve Crocker, and Jeff Schiller.
 *
 * Using a RC4 stream cipher as 2nd stage after the MD5 (now SHA512) output
 * is the result of work by David Mazieres.

 * For the purposes of better mixing, we use the CRC-32 polynomial as
 * well to make a twisted Generalized Feedback Shift Register
 *

 * Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation 2(3):179-194.
 * Also see M. Matsumoto & Y. Kurita, 1994.  Twisted GFSR generators
 * II.  ACM Transactions on Mdeling and Computer Simulation 4:254-266)
 *
 * Thanks to Colin Plumb for suggesting this.
 *
 * We have not analyzed the resultant polynomial to prove it primitive;
 * in fact it almost certainly isn't.  Nonetheless, the irreducible factors
 * of a random large-degree polynomial over GF(2) are more than large enough
 * that periodicity is not a concern.
 *
 * The input hash is much less sensitive than the output hash.  All
 * we want from it is to be a good non-cryptographic hash -
 * i.e. to not produce collisions when fed "random" data of the sort
 * we expect to see.  As long as the pool state differs for different
 * inputs, we have preserved the input entropy and done a good job.
 * The fact that an intelligent attacker can construct inputs that
 * will produce controlled alterations to the pool's state is not
 * important because we don't consider such inputs to contribute any
 * randomness.  The only property we need with respect to them is that
 * the attacker can't increase his/her knowledge of the pool's state.
 * Since all additions are reversible (knowing the final state and the
 * input, you can reconstruct the initial state), if an attacker has
 * any uncertainty about the initial state, he/she can only shuffle
 * that uncertainty about, but never cause any collisions (which would
 * decrease the uncertainty).
 *
 * The chosen system lets the state of the pool be (essentially) the input
 * modulo the generator polynomial.  Now, for random primitive polynomials,
 * this is a universal class of hash functions, meaning that the chance
 * of a collision is limited by the attacker's knowledge of the generator
 * polynomial, so if it is chosen at random, an attacker can never force
 * a collision.  Here, we use a fixed polynomial, but we *can* assume that
 * ###--> it is unknown to the processes generating the input entropy. <-###
 * Because of this important property, this is a good, collision-resistant
 * hash; hash collisions will occur no more often than chance.
