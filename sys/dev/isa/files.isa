# Config.new file and device description for machine-independent ISA code.
# Included by ports that need it.  Requires that the SCSI files be
# defined first.

# ports should define their own "device isa" line (like the one below,
# but with the correct bus attachment).  IT MUST USE CONFIGURATION
# LOCATORS IDENTICAL TO THOSE SPECIFIED BELOW.

# ports should specify appropriate major numbers for the following
# devices:
#	mcd, scd, wd, wt

#device	isa at root {[port = -1], [size = 0],
#		     [iomem = -1], [iosiz = 0],
#		     [irq = -1], [drq = -1]}
