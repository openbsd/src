/**
 * DOC: Memory Objects Control State (MOCS)
 *
 * Motivation:
 * In previous Gens the MOCS settings was a value that was set by user land as
 * part of the batch. In Gen9 this has changed to be a single table (per ring)
 * that all batches now reference by index instead of programming the MOCS
 * directly.
 *
 * The one wrinkle in this is that only PART of the MOCS tables are included
 * in context (The GFX_MOCS_0 - GFX_MOCS_64 and the LNCFCMOCS0 - LNCFCMOCS32
 * registers). The rest are not (the settings for the other rings).
 *
 * This table needs to be set at system start-up because the way the table
 * interacts with the contexts and the GmmLib interface.
 *
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 * The tables (one per supported platform) are defined in intel_mocs.c
 * and are programmed in the first batch after the context is loaded
 * (with the hardware workarounds). This will then let the usual
 * context handling keep the MOCS in step.
