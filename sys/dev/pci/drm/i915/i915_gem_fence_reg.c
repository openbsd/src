/**
 * DOC: fence register handling
 *
 * Important to avoid confusions: "fences" in the i915 driver are not execution
 * fences used to track command completion but hardware detiler objects which
 * wrap a given range of the global GTT. Each platform has only a fairly limited
 * set of these objects.
 *
 * Fences are used to detile GTT memory mappings. They're also connected to the
 * hardware frontbuffer render tracking and hence interact with frontbuffer
 * compression. Furthermore on older platforms fences are required for tiled
 * objects used by the display engine. They can also be used by the render
 * engine - they're required for blitter commands and are optional for render
 * commands. But on gen4+ both display (with the exception of fbc) and rendering
 * have their own tiling state bits and don't need fences.
 *
 * Also note that fences only support X and Y tiling and hence can't be used for
 * the fancier new tiling formats like W, Ys and Yf.
 *
 * Finally note that because fences are such a restricted resource they're
 * dynamically associated with objects. Furthermore fence state is committed to
 * the hardware lazily to avoid unnecessary stalls on gen2/3. Therefore code must
 * explicitly call i915_gem_object_get_fence() to synchronize fencing status
 * for cpu access. Also note that some code wants an unfenced view, for those
 * cases the fence can be removed forcefully with i915_gem_object_put_fence().
 *
 * Internally these functions will synchronize with userspace access by removing
 * CPU ptes into GTT mmaps (not the GTT ptes themselves) as needed.

/**
 * DOC: tiling swizzling details
 *
 * The idea behind tiling is to increase cache hit rates by rearranging
 * pixel data so that a group of pixel accesses are in the same cacheline.
 * Performance improvement from doing this on the back/depth buffer are on
 * the order of 30%.
 *
 * Intel architectures make this somewhat more complicated, though, by
 * adjustments made to addressing of data when the memory is in interleaved
 * mode (matched pairs of DIMMS) to improve memory bandwidth.
 * For interleaved memory, the CPU sends every sequential 64 bytes
 * to an alternate memory channel so it can get the bandwidth from both.
 *
 * The GPU also rearranges its accesses for increased bandwidth to interleaved
 * memory, and it matches what the CPU does for non-tiled.  However, when tiled
 * it does it a little differently, since one walks addresses not just in the
 * X direction but also Y.  So, along with alternating channels when bit
 * 6 of the address flips, it also alternates when other bits flip --  Bits 9
 * (every 512 bytes, an X tile scanline) and 10 (every two X tile scanlines)
 * are common to both the 915 and 965-class hardware.
 *
 * The CPU also sometimes XORs in higher bits as well, to improve
 * bandwidth doing strided access like we do so frequently in graphics.  This
 * is called "Channel XOR Randomization" in the MCH documentation.  The result
 * is that the CPU is XORing in either bit 11 or bit 17 to bit 6 of its address
 * decode.
 *
 * All of this bit 6 XORing has an effect on our memory management,
 * as we need to make sure that the 3d driver can correctly address object
 * contents.
 *
 * If we don't have interleaved memory, all tiling is safe and no swizzling is
 * required.
 *
 * When bit 17 is XORed in, we simply refuse to tile at all.  Bit
 * 17 is not just a page offset, so as we page an object out and back in,
 * individual pages in it will have different bit 17 addresses, resulting in
 * each 64 bytes being swapped with its neighbor!
 *
 * Otherwise, if interleaved, we have to tell the 3d driver what the address
 * swizzling it needs to do is, since it's writing with the CPU to the pages
 * (bit 6 and potentially bit 11 XORed in), and the GPU is reading from the
 * pages (bit 6, 9, and 10 XORed in), resulting in a cumulative bit swizzling
 * required by the CPU of XORing in bit 6, 9, 10, and potentially 11, in order
 * to match what the GPU expects.

		 *

		 *    slot fill         memory size  swizzling
		 * 0A   0B   1A   1B    1-ch   2-ch
		 * 512  0    0    0     512    0     O
		 * 512  0    512  0     16     1008  X

		 * 1024 1024 1024 0     2048   1024  O
		 *
		 * We could probably detect this based on either the DRB
		 * matching, which was the case for the swizzling required in
		 * the table above, or from the 1-ch value being less than
		 * the minimum size of a rank.
		 *
		 * Reports indicate that the swizzling actually
		 * varies depending upon page placement inside the
		 * channels, i.e. we see swizzled pages where the
		 * banks of memory are paired and unswizzled on the
		 * uneven portion, so leave that as unknown.
