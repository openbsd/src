/**
 * DOC: batch pool
 *
 * In order to submit batch buffers as 'secure', the software command parser
 * must ensure that a batch buffer cannot be modified after parsing. It does
 * this by copying the user provided batch buffer contents to a kernel owned
 * buffer from which the hardware will actually execute, and by carefully
 * managing the address space bindings for such buffers.
 *
 * The batch pool framework provides a mechanism for the driver to manage a
 * set of scratch buffers to use for this purpose. The framework can be
 * extended to support other uses cases should they arise.
