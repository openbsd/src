 *
 * This function is the main interface to the shrinker. It will try to release

 * Selection of the specific caches can be done with @flags. This is e.g. useful

 *
 * Note that it's not guaranteed that released amount is actually available as
 * free system memory - the pages might still be in-used to due to other reasons
 * (like cpu mmaps) or the mm core has reused them before we could grab them.
 * Therefore code that needs to explicitly shrink buffer objects caches (e.g. to
 * avoid deadlocks in memory reclaim) must fall back to i915_gem_shrink_all().
 *
 * Also note that any kind of pinning (both per-vma address space pins and
 * backing storage pins at the buffer object level) result in the shrinker code
 * having to skip the object.
