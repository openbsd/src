 * sequence number. If upon call of this function, the buffer object is already
 * reserved, the validation sequence is checked against the validation
 * sequence of the process currently reserving the buffer,
 * and if the current validation sequence is greater than that of the process
 * holding the reservation, the function returns -EDEADLK. Otherwise it sleeps
 * waiting for the buffer to become unreserved, after which it retries
 * reserving.
 * The caller should, when receiving an -EDEADLK error
 * release all its buffer reservations, wait for @bo to become unreserved, and

 * will always guarantee that the process with the lowest validation sequence
 * will eventually succeed, preventing both deadlocks and starvation.
