Rewrite handler_set to allow sub regions, minimums, etc without having to
register 100 callbacks for 100 quad reads.

Use handler set (with NULL cb) to create a higher level <bus>_unreg

Move all mbuf code to if_fw.c. Make if_fw use the generic read/write/inreg and
then it can translate the packets into the appropriate mbuf's.

Need a tlabel alloc routine within fwohci and a way to use 64 tlabel's per
node (rather than a global set of 64 as it's used now).

Flesh out the documentation of the high level API in fwohci.c (fwlynx will need
to implement the same thing so this should be more than just comments in 
fwohci.c)

Move SBP2 routines into their own file.

done - Rewrite ROM parsing/validation. Unroll all recursion, add ref counting, 
       path elimination, etc. 

done - Move rom routines into their own files to allow easier cross usage.

done - Write sub match setup for fwnode/fwscsi so matching devices listed in 
       the ROM can be done via autoconf.

done - Remove all of the devcap stuff.

SBP2 needs a complete API written up: logins, ORB management/allocation, etc.

done - Add locator detection/usage into fwohci code.

Should do topology maps, speed maps, the various bus managers, etc.

done - change all FW_DEBUG wrapped printf's to DPRINTF macro's

done - ack errors from a TX complete should get passed up to any registered callbacks

Track down issues where multiple hosts plugged into a firewire hub don't 
init/see all devices on resets sometimes.

done - Make fwohci detach correctly (for cardbus/etc type interfaces)
