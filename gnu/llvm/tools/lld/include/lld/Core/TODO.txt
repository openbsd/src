~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The yaml reader/writer interfaces should be changed to return
  an explanatory string if there is an error.  The existing error_code
  abstraction only works for returning low level OS errors.  It does not
  work for describing formatting issues.

* We need to design a diagnostics interface.  It would be nice to share code
  with Clang_ where possible.

* We need to add more attributes to File.  In particular, we need cpu
  and OS information (like target triples).  We should also provide explicit
  support for `LLVM IR module flags metadata`__.
