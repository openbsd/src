=head1 Global Variables
These variables are global to an entire process.  They are shared between
all interpreters and all threads in a process.  Any variables not documented
here may be changed or removed without notice, so don't use them!
If you feel you really do need to use an unlisted variable, first send email to
L<perl5-porters@perl.org|mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org>.  It may be that
someone there will point out a way to accomplish what you need without using an
internal variable.  But if not, you should get a go-ahead to document and then
use the variable.

/*
=for apidoc AmU|Perl_check_t *|PL_check

Array, indexed by opcode, of functions that will be called for the "check"
phase of optree building during compilation of Perl code.  For most (but
not all) types of op, once the op has been initially built and populated
with child ops it will be filtered through the check function referenced
by the appropriate element of this array.  The new op is passed in as the
sole argument to the check function, and the check function returns the
completed op.  The check function may (as the name suggests) check the op
for validity and signal errors.  It may also initialise or modify parts of
the ops, or perform more radical surgery such as adding or removing child
ops, or even throw the op away and return a different op in its place.

This array of function pointers is a convenient place to hook into the
compilation process.  An XS module can put its own custom check function
in place of any of the standard ones, to influence the compilation of a
particular type of op.  However, a custom check function must never fully
replace a standard check function (or even a custom check function from
another module).  A module modifying checking must instead B<wrap> the
preexisting check function.  A custom check function must be selective
about when to apply its custom behaviour.  In the usual case where
it decides not to do anything special with an op, it must chain the
preexisting op function.  Check functions are thus linked in a chain,
with the core's base checker at the end.

For thread safety, modules should not write directly to this array.
Instead, use the function L</wrap_op_checker>.

=for apidoc AmUx|Perl_keyword_plugin_t|PL_keyword_plugin

Function pointer, pointing at a function used to handle extended keywords.
The function should be declared as

	int keyword_plugin_function(pTHX_
		char *keyword_ptr, STRLEN keyword_len,
		OP **op_ptr)

The function is called from the tokeniser, whenever a possible keyword
is seen.  C<keyword_ptr> points at the word in the parser's input
buffer, and C<keyword_len> gives its length; it is not null-terminated.
The function is expected to examine the word, and possibly other state
such as L<%^H|perlvar/%^H>, to decide whether it wants to handle it
as an extended keyword.  If it does not, the function should return
C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_DECLINE>, and the normal parser process will continue.

If the function wants to handle the keyword, it first must
parse anything following the keyword that is part of the syntax
introduced by the keyword.  See L</Lexer interface> for details.

When a keyword is being handled, the plugin function must build
a tree of C<OP> structures, representing the code that was parsed.
The root of the tree must be stored in C<*op_ptr>.  The function then
returns a constant indicating the syntactic role of the construct that
it has parsed: C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_STMT> if it is a complete statement, or
C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_EXPR> if it is an expression.  Note that a statement
construct cannot be used inside an expression (except via C<do BLOCK>
and similar), and an expression is not a complete statement (it requires
at least a terminating semicolon).

When a keyword is handled, the plugin function may also have
(compile-time) side effects.  It may modify C<%^H>, define functions, and
so on.  Typically, if side effects are the main purpose of a handler,
it does not wish to generate any ops to be included in the normal
compilation.  In this case it is still required to supply an op tree,
but it suffices to generate a single null op.

That's how the C<*PL_keyword_plugin> function needs to behave overall.
Conventionally, however, one does not completely replace the existing
handler function.  Instead, take a copy of C<PL_keyword_plugin> before
assigning your own function pointer to it.  Your handler function should
look for keywords that it is interested in and handle those.  Where it
is not interested, it should call the saved plugin function, passing on
the arguments it received.  Thus C<PL_keyword_plugin> actually points
at a chain of handler functions, all of which have an opportunity to
handle keywords, and only the last function in the chain (built into
the Perl core) will normally return C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_DECLINE>.

For thread safety, modules should not set this variable directly.
Instead, use the function L</wrap_keyword_plugin>.
