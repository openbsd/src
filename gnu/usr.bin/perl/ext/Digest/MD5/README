The Digest::MD5 module allows you to use the RSA Data Security
Inc. MD5 Message Digest algorithm from within Perl programs.  The
algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as
output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.
MD5 is described in RFC 1321.

You will need perl version 5.004 or better to install this module.
