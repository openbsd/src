   Release 2.12

   Speed up pure perl base64 encoder/decoder by using join/map instead
   of while loop.  Contributed by Arno Beckmann <arno@gmx.de>

   Doc update contributed by Jerrad Pierce <belg4mit@CALLOWAY.MIT.EDU>

   Downgrade UTF8 strings before starting to encode.



1999-02-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.11

   Fixed bogus "Premature end of base64 data" warning.  Bug spotted
   by Dwayne Jacques Fontenot.

   Workaround for Redhat shipping trial releases of perl.



1998-12-18   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.10

   A tweak that should make compilation with some old perl5.00[23]
   perls better.

   A cast that make some compilers more happy.



1998-11-13   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.09

   The 2.08 release did not compile with perl5.005_53, because
   all simple globals now need to be prefixed with "PL_".



1998-10-22   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.08

   Found another tweak to speed up decode_base64() with another 3%.

   Improved MIME::Base64 documentation a little.



1998-10-21   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.07

   Faster and smarter C implementation of the decode_base64()
   function.  The new decode_base64() was 25% faster when tested
   on Linux, i586, gcc -O2.



1998-07-15   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.06

   The decode_base64() implemented in pure perl will only carp
   (not croak) if length of data to decode is not a multiple 4.  This
   actually made 'make test' fail after 'rm Base64.xs'.



1998-01-27   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.05

   The decode_base64() would previously allocate a too short buffer for the
   result string when the trailing "==" padding was missing in the string to
   be decoded.

   The encode_base64() now allocate one byte less space in the result
   strings returned.



1997-12-02   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.04

   Documentation expanded a bit.



1997-07-10   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.03

   Decode_base64() doesn't croak on premature ended data any more.
   A warning is generated instead if running under -w.
   


1997-06-27   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.02

   QuotedPrint fix by Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org>:

      - Long lines were not broken unless they're at the beginning
        of the text

      - Lines near but not over 76 chars were broken when they
        shouldn't be



1997-06-13   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.01

   Base64.xs: Avoid type convertion warnings with some compilers

   Minor documentation updates



1997-04-24   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.00, based on libwww-perl-5.08.
