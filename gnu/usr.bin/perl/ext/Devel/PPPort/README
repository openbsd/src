1. DESCRIPTION
--------------

Perl's API has changed over time, gaining new features, new functions,
increasing its flexibility, and reducing the impact on the C namespace
environment (reduced pollution). The header file written by this module,
typically F<ppport.h>, attempts to bring some of the newer Perl API
features to older versions of Perl, so that you can worry less about
keeping track of old releases, but users can still reap the benefit.

---------------
2. INSTALLATION
---------------

Installation of the Devel::PPPort module follows the standard Perl Way
and should not be harder than:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Note that you may need to become superuser to 'make install'.

If you're building the module under Windows, you may need to use a
different make program, such as 'nmake', instead of 'make'.

----------------
3. DOCUMENTATION
----------------

To see the documentation, use the perldoc command:

  perldoc Devel::PPPort

You can also visit CPAN Search and see the documentation online as
pretty nice HTML. This is also where you will find the most recent
version of this module:

system or any of its tests fail, please use the CPAN Request Tracker
