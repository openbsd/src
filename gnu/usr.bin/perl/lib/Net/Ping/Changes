2.35  Feb 08 14:42 2008
	- Patch in Perl change #33242 by Nicholas Clark 
		<http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse/p/33242>

2.34  Dec 19 08:51 2007
        - Release primarily to prevent problems with the Perl core in
	  preparation for the Perl 5.10 release.  No real bug fixes, but
          text fixes are included.
	- skip test t/510_ping_udp.t on Windows Vista.  Thanks to Jan
	  Dubois for the code to test for Vista.
        - t/510_ping_udp.t should check for a udp echo port, not a tcp
	  echo port.

2.33  Jul 31 20:15 2007
	- add new method port_number() rather than asking users to
          twiddle with the internals of Net::Ping to probe a specific
          port.  This should resolve a few bugs where the documentation
	  was lacking.
	- apply patch from bergonz at labs.it.  This patch resolves
	  several problems logged regarding using Net::Ping in a multi-
	  threaded program.  Thanks so much!

	  in order to avoid catching SIGALRM trigger and
	  to avoid conflicts with other evals.

	  detection on non-blocking tcp connects.
	- 4) Fix fcntl() syntax usage.

	  tries to dink with the data stream.

	  (solaris and freebsd) and to be SMP safer.
	- Win32 $p->ack( $host ) method should now work.
