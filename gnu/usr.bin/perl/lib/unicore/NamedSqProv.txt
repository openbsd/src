# Provisional Named Sequences
# Note: This data file contains those named
#   sequences which have been designated to be provisional,
#   rather than fully approved.
#
# Format:
# Name of Sequence; Code Point Sequence for USI
#
# Code point sequences in the UCD use spaces as delimiters.
# The corresponding format for a USI in ISO/IEC 10646 uses
# comma delimitation and angle brackets. Thus, a named sequence
# of the form:
#
# EXAMPLE NAME;1000 1001 1002
#
# in this data file, would correspond to a 10646 USI as follows:
#
# <1000, 1001, 1002> 
#
# Note: The order of entries in this file is not significant.
# However, entries are generally in script order corresponding
# to block order in the Unicode Standard, to make it easier
# to find entries currently in the list.
