/* The following numbers describe the earliest compatible version of
   Perl ("compatibility" here being defined as sufficient binary/API
   compatibility to run XS code built with the older version).
   Normally this should not change across maintenance releases.

   Note that this only refers to an out-of-the-box build.  Many non-default
   options such as usemultiplicity tend to break binary compatibility
   more often.

   This is used by Configure et al to figure out
   PERL_INC_VERSION_LIST, which lists version libraries
   to include in @INC.  See INSTALL for how this works.

   Porting/bump-perl-version will automatically set these to the version of perl
   to be released for blead releases, and to 5.X.0 for maint releases. Manually
   changing them should not be necessary.

	local_patches -- list of locally applied less-than-subversion patches.
	If you're distributing such a patch, please give it a name and a
	one-line description, placed just before the last NULL in the array
	below.  If your patch fixes a bug in the perlbug database, please
	mention the bugid.  If your patch *IS* dependent on a prior patch,
	please place your applied patch line after its dependencies. This
	will help tracking of patch dependencies.

	Please either use 'diff --unified=0' if your diff supports
	that or edit the hunk of the diff output which adds your patch
	to this list, to remove context lines which would give patch
	problems. For instance, if the original context diff is

	   *** patchlevel.h.orig	<date here>
	   --- patchlevel.h	<date here>
	   *** 38,43 ***
	   --- 38,44 ---
	     	,"FOO1235 - some patch"
	     	,"BAR3141 - another patch"
	     	,"BAZ2718 - and another patch"
	   + 	,"MINE001 - my new patch"
	     	,NULL
	     };

	please change it to
	   *** patchlevel.h.orig	<date here>
	   --- patchlevel.h	<date here>
	   *** 41,43 ***
	   --- 41,44 ---
	   + 	,"MINE001 - my new patch"
	     	,NULL
	     };

	(Note changes to line numbers as well as removal of context lines.)
	This will prevent patch from choking if someone has previously
	applied different patches than you.

        History has shown that nobody distributes patches that also
        modify patchlevel.h. Do it yourself. The following perl
        program can be used to add a comment to patchlevel.h:

#!perl
die "Usage: perl -x patchlevel.h comment ..." unless @ARGV;
open PLIN, "patchlevel.h" or die "Couldn't open patchlevel.h : $!";
open PLOUT, ">patchlevel.new" or die "Couldn't write on patchlevel.new : $!";
my $seen=0;
while (<PLIN>) {
    if (/\t,NULL/ and $seen) {
       while (my $c = shift @ARGV){
	    $c =~ s|\\|\\\\|g;
	    $c =~ s|"|\\"|g;
            print PLOUT qq{\t,"$c"\n};
       }
    }
    $seen++ if /local_patches\[\]/;
    print PLOUT;
}
close PLOUT or die "Couldn't close filehandle writing to patchlevel.new : $!";
close PLIN or die "Couldn't close filehandle reading from patchlevel.h : $!";
close DATA; # needed to allow unlink to work win32.
unlink "patchlevel.bak" or warn "Couldn't unlink patchlevel.bak : $!"
  if -e "patchlevel.bak";
rename "patchlevel.h", "patchlevel.bak" or
  die "Couldn't rename patchlevel.h to patchlevel.bak : $!";
rename "patchlevel.new", "patchlevel.h" or
  die "Couldn't rename patchlevel.new to patchlevel.h : $!";
__END__

Please keep empty lines below so that context diffs of this file do
not ever collect the lines belonging to local_patches() into the same
hunk.
