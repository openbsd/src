/* XXX A note on the perl source internal type system.  The
   original intent was that I32 be *exactly* 32 bits.

   Currently, we only guarantee that I32 is *at least* 32 bits.
   Specifically, if int is 64 bits, then so is I32.  (This is the case
   for the Cray.)  This has the advantage of meshing nicely with
   standard library calls (where we pass an I32 and the library is
   expecting an int), but the disadvantage that an I32 is not 32 bits.
   Andy Dougherty	August 1996

   There is no guarantee that there is *any* integral type with
   exactly 32 bits.  It is perfectly legal for a system to have
   sizeof(short) == sizeof(int) == sizeof(long) == 8.

   Similarly, there is no guarantee that I16 and U16 have exactly 16
   bits.

   For dealing with issues that may arise from various 32/64-bit
   systems, we will ask Configure to check out

	SHORTSIZE == sizeof(short)
	INTSIZE == sizeof(int)
	LONGSIZE == sizeof(long)
	LONGLONGSIZE == sizeof(long long) (if HAS_LONG_LONG)
	PTRSIZE == sizeof(void *)
	DOUBLESIZE == sizeof(double)
	LONG_DOUBLESIZE == sizeof(long double) (if HAS_LONG_DOUBLE).

New macros should use the following conventions for their names (which are
based on the underlying C library functions):

  (mem | str n? ) (EQ | NE | LT | GT | GE | (( BEGIN | END ) P? )) l? s?

  Each has two main parameters, string-like operands that are compared
  against each other, as specified by the macro name.  Some macros may
  additionally have one or potentially even two length parameters.  If a length
  parameter applies to both string parameters, it will be positioned third;
  otherwise any length parameter immediately follows the string parameter it
  applies to.

  If the prefix to the name is 'str', the string parameter is a pointer to a C
  language string.  Such a string does not contain embedded NUL bytes; its
  length may be unknown, but can be calculated by C<strlen()>, since it is
  terminated by a NUL, which isn't included in its length.

  The optional 'n' following 'str' means that that there is a third parameter,
  giving the maximum number of bytes to look at in each string.  Even if both
  strings are longer than the length parameter, those extra bytes will be
  unexamined.

  The 's' suffix means that the 2nd byte string parameter is a literal C
  double-quoted string.  Its length will automatically be calculated by the
  macro, so no length parameter will ever be needed for it.

  If the prefix is 'mem', the string parameters don't have to be C strings;
  they may contain embedded NUL bytes, do not necessarily have a terminating
  NUL, and their lengths can be known only through other means, which in
  practice are additional parameter(s) passed to the function.  All 'mem'
  functions have at least one length parameter.  Barring any 'l' or 's' suffix,
  there is a single length parameter, in position 3, which applies to both
  string parameters.  The 's' suffix means, as described above, that the 2nd
  string is a literal double-quoted C string (hence its length is calculated by
  the macro, and the length parameter to the function applies just to the first
  string parameter, and hence is positioned just after it).  An 'l' suffix
  means that the 2nd string parameter has its own length parameter, and the
  signature will look like memFOOl(s1, l1, s2, l2).

  BEGIN (and END) are for testing if the 2nd string is an initial (or final)
  substring  of the 1st string.  'P' if present indicates that the substring
  must be a "proper" one in tha mathematical sense that the first one must be
  strictly larger than the 2nd.

=head1 Character classification
This section is about functions (really macros) that classify characters
into types, such as punctuation versus alphabetic, etc.  Most of these are
analogous to regular expression character classes.  (See
L<perlrecharclass/POSIX Character Classes>.)  There are several variants for
each class.  (Not all macros have all variants; each item below lists the
ones valid for it.)  None are affected by C<use bytes>, and only the ones
with C<LC> in the name are affected by the current locale.

The base function, e.g., C<isALPHA()>, takes an octet (either a C<char> or a
C<U8>) as input and returns a boolean as to whether or not the character
represented by that octet is (or on non-ASCII platforms, corresponds to) an
ASCII character in the named class based on platform, Unicode, and Perl rules.
If the input is a number that doesn't fit in an octet, FALSE is returned.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_A> (e.g., C<isALPHA_A()>) is identical to the base function
with no suffix C<"_A">.  This variant is used to emphasize by its name that
only ASCII-range characters can return TRUE.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_L1> imposes the Latin-1 (or EBCDIC equivalent) character set
onto the platform.  That is, the code points that are ASCII are unaffected,
since ASCII is a subset of Latin-1.  But the non-ASCII code points are treated
as if they are Latin-1 characters.  For example, C<isWORDCHAR_L1()> will return
true when called with the code point 0xDF, which is a word character in both
ASCII and EBCDIC (though it represents different characters in each).

Variant C<isI<FOO>_uvchr> is like the C<isI<FOO>_L1> variant, but accepts any UV code
point as input.  If the code point is larger than 255, Unicode rules are used
to determine if it is in the character class.  For example,
C<isWORDCHAR_uvchr(0x100)> returns TRUE, since 0x100 is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
WITH MACRON in Unicode, and is a word character.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe> is like C<isI<FOO>_uvchr>, but is used for UTF-8
encoded strings.  Each call classifies one character, even if the string
contains many.  This variant takes two parameters.  The first, C<p>, is a
pointer to the first byte of the character to be classified.  (Recall that it
may take more than one byte to represent a character in UTF-8 strings.)  The
second parameter, C<e>, points to anywhere in the string beyond the first
character, up to one byte past the end of the entire string.  The suffix
C<_safe> in the function's name indicates that it will not attempt to read
beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is true (this
is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the input
character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the function may
return FALSE, at the discretion of the implementation, and subject to change in
future releases.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_utf8> is like C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe>, but takes just a single
parameter, C<p>, which has the same meaning as the corresponding parameter does
in C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe>.  The function therefore can't check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take a second
parameter, becoming a synonym for C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe>.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C<isI<FOO>_utf8> from each call point in the
program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can convert
your program now to use C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe>, and avoid the warnings, and get an
extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when you'll be forced
to add the C<e> parameter.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_LC> is like the C<isI<FOO>_A> and C<isI<FOO>_L1> variants, but the
result is based on the current locale, which is what C<LC> in the name stands
for.  If Perl can determine that the current locale is a UTF-8 locale, it uses
the published Unicode rules; otherwise, it uses the C library function that
gives the named classification.  For example, C<isDIGIT_LC()> when not in a
UTF-8 locale returns the result of calling C<isdigit()>.  FALSE is always
returned if the input won't fit into an octet.  On some platforms where the C
library function is known to be defective, Perl changes its result to follow
the POSIX standard's rules.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_LC_uvchr> is like C<isI<FOO>_LC>, but is defined on any UV.  It
returns the same as C<isI<FOO>_LC> for input code points less than 256, and
returns the hard-coded, not-affected-by-locale, Unicode results for larger ones.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe> is like C<isI<FOO>_LC_uvchr>, but is used for UTF-8
encoded strings.  Each call classifies one character, even if the string
contains many.  This variant takes two parameters.  The first, C<p>, is a
pointer to the first byte of the character to be classified.  (Recall that it
may take more than one byte to represent a character in UTF-8 strings.) The
second parameter, C<e>, points to anywhere in the string beyond the first
character, up to one byte past the end of the entire string.  The suffix
C<_safe> in the function's name indicates that it will not attempt to read
beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is true (this
is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the input
character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the function may
return FALSE, at the discretion of the implementation, and subject to change in
future releases.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8> is like C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe>, but takes just a single
parameter, C<p>, which has the same meaning as the corresponding parameter does
in C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe>.  The function therefore can't check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take a second
parameter, becoming a synonym for C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe>.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8> from each call point in
the program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can
convert your program now to use C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe>, and avoid the warnings,
and get an extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when
you'll be forced to add the C<e> parameter.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isALPHA|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is an
alphabetic character, analogous to C<m/[[:alpha:]]/>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isALPHA_A>, C<isALPHA_L1>, C<isALPHA_uvchr>, C<isALPHA_utf8_safe>,
C<isALPHA_LC>, C<isALPHA_LC_uvchr>, and C<isALPHA_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isALPHANUMERIC|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a either an
alphabetic character or decimal digit, analogous to C<m/[[:alnum:]]/>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isALPHANUMERIC_A>, C<isALPHANUMERIC_L1>, C<isALPHANUMERIC_uvchr>,
C<isALPHANUMERIC_utf8_safe>, C<isALPHANUMERIC_LC>, C<isALPHANUMERIC_LC_uvchr>,
and C<isALPHANUMERIC_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isASCII|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is one of the 128
characters in the ASCII character set, analogous to C<m/[[:ascii:]]/>.
On non-ASCII platforms, it returns TRUE iff this
character corresponds to an ASCII character.  Variants C<isASCII_A()> and
C<isASCII_L1()> are identical to C<isASCII()>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isASCII_uvchr>, C<isASCII_utf8_safe>, C<isASCII_LC>, C<isASCII_LC_uvchr>, and
C<isASCII_LC_utf8_safe>.  Note, however, that some platforms do not have the C
library routine C<isascii()>.  In these cases, the variants whose names contain
C<LC> are the same as the corresponding ones without.

Also note, that because all ASCII characters are UTF-8 invariant (meaning they
have the exact same representation (always a single byte) whether encoded in
UTF-8 or not), C<isASCII> will give the correct results when called with any
byte in any string encoded or not in UTF-8.  And similarly C<isASCII_utf8_safe>
will work properly on any string encoded or not in UTF-8.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isBLANK|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a
character considered to be a blank, analogous to C<m/[[:blank:]]/>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isBLANK_A>, C<isBLANK_L1>, C<isBLANK_uvchr>, C<isBLANK_utf8_safe>,
C<isBLANK_LC>, C<isBLANK_LC_uvchr>, and C<isBLANK_LC_utf8_safe>.  Note,
however, that some platforms do not have the C library routine
C<isblank()>.  In these cases, the variants whose names contain C<LC> are
the same as the corresponding ones without.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isCNTRL|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a
control character, analogous to C<m/[[:cntrl:]]/>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isCNTRL_A>, C<isCNTRL_L1>, C<isCNTRL_uvchr>, C<isCNTRL_utf8_safe>,
C<isCNTRL_LC>, C<isCNTRL_LC_uvchr>, and C<isCNTRL_LC_utf8_safe> On EBCDIC
platforms, you almost always want to use the C<isCNTRL_L1> variant.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isDIGIT|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a
digit, analogous to C<m/[[:digit:]]/>.
Variants C<isDIGIT_A> and C<isDIGIT_L1> are identical to C<isDIGIT>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isDIGIT_uvchr>, C<isDIGIT_utf8_safe>, C<isDIGIT_LC>, C<isDIGIT_LC_uvchr>, and
C<isDIGIT_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isGRAPH|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a
graphic character, analogous to C<m/[[:graph:]]/>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants C<isGRAPH_A>, C<isGRAPH_L1>, C<isGRAPH_uvchr>, C<isGRAPH_utf8_safe>,
C<isGRAPH_LC>, C<isGRAPH_LC_uvchr>, and C<isGRAPH_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isLOWER|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a
lowercase character, analogous to C<m/[[:lower:]]/>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isLOWER_A>, C<isLOWER_L1>, C<isLOWER_uvchr>, C<isLOWER_utf8_safe>,
C<isLOWER_LC>, C<isLOWER_LC_uvchr>, and C<isLOWER_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isOCTAL|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is an
octal digit, [0-7].
The only two variants are C<isOCTAL_A> and C<isOCTAL_L1>; each is identical to
C<isOCTAL>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isPUNCT|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a
punctuation character, analogous to C<m/[[:punct:]]/>.
Note that the definition of what is punctuation isn't as
straightforward as one might desire.  See L<perlrecharclass/POSIX Character
Classes> for details.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants C<isPUNCT_A>, C<isPUNCT_L1>, C<isPUNCT_uvchr>, C<isPUNCT_utf8_safe>,
C<isPUNCT_LC>, C<isPUNCT_LC_uvchr>, and C<isPUNCT_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isSPACE|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a
whitespace character.  This is analogous
to what C<m/\s/> matches in a regular expression.  Starting in Perl 5.18
this also matches what C<m/[[:space:]]/> does.  Prior to 5.18, only the
locale forms of this macro (the ones with C<LC> in their names) matched
precisely what C<m/[[:space:]]/> does.  In those releases, the only difference,
in the non-locale variants, was that C<isSPACE()> did not match a vertical tab.
(See L</isPSXSPC> for a macro that matches a vertical tab in all releases.)
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isSPACE_A>, C<isSPACE_L1>, C<isSPACE_uvchr>, C<isSPACE_utf8_safe>,
C<isSPACE_LC>, C<isSPACE_LC_uvchr>, and C<isSPACE_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isPSXSPC|char ch
(short for Posix Space)
Starting in 5.18, this is identical in all its forms to the
corresponding C<isSPACE()> macros.
The locale forms of this macro are identical to their corresponding
C<isSPACE()> forms in all Perl releases.  In releases prior to 5.18, the
non-locale forms differ from their C<isSPACE()> forms only in that the
C<isSPACE()> forms don't match a Vertical Tab, and the C<isPSXSPC()> forms do.
Otherwise they are identical.  Thus this macro is analogous to what
C<m/[[:space:]]/> matches in a regular expression.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants C<isPSXSPC_A>, C<isPSXSPC_L1>, C<isPSXSPC_uvchr>, C<isPSXSPC_utf8_safe>,
C<isPSXSPC_LC>, C<isPSXSPC_LC_uvchr>, and C<isPSXSPC_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isUPPER|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is an
uppercase character, analogous to C<m/[[:upper:]]/>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants C<isUPPER_A>, C<isUPPER_L1>, C<isUPPER_uvchr>, C<isUPPER_utf8_safe>,
C<isUPPER_LC>, C<isUPPER_LC_uvchr>, and C<isUPPER_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isPRINT|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a
printable character, analogous to C<m/[[:print:]]/>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isPRINT_A>, C<isPRINT_L1>, C<isPRINT_uvchr>, C<isPRINT_utf8_safe>,
C<isPRINT_LC>, C<isPRINT_LC_uvchr>, and C<isPRINT_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isWORDCHAR|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a character
that is a word character, analogous to what C<m/\w/> and C<m/[[:word:]]/> match
in a regular expression.  A word character is an alphabetic character, a
decimal digit, a connecting punctuation character (such as an underscore), or
a "mark" character that attaches to one of those (like some sort of accent).
C<isALNUM()> is a synonym provided for backward compatibility, even though a
word character includes more than the standard C language meaning of
alphanumeric.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants C<isWORDCHAR_A>, C<isWORDCHAR_L1>, C<isWORDCHAR_uvchr>, and
C<isWORDCHAR_utf8_safe>.  C<isWORDCHAR_LC>, C<isWORDCHAR_LC_uvchr>, and
C<isWORDCHAR_LC_utf8_safe> are also as described there, but additionally
include the platform's native underscore.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isXDIGIT|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a hexadecimal
digit.  In the ASCII range these are C<[0-9A-Fa-f]>.  Variants C<isXDIGIT_A()>
and C<isXDIGIT_L1()> are identical to C<isXDIGIT()>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isXDIGIT_uvchr>, C<isXDIGIT_utf8_safe>, C<isXDIGIT_LC>, C<isXDIGIT_LC_uvchr>,
and C<isXDIGIT_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isIDFIRST|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character can be the first
character of an identifier.  This is very close to, but not quite the same as
the official Unicode property C<XID_Start>.  The difference is that this
returns true only if the input character also matches L</isWORDCHAR>.
See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for an explanation of
variants
C<isIDFIRST_A>, C<isIDFIRST_L1>, C<isIDFIRST_uvchr>, C<isIDFIRST_utf8_safe>,
C<isIDFIRST_LC>, C<isIDFIRST_LC_uvchr>, and C<isIDFIRST_LC_utf8_safe>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|isIDCONT|char ch
Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character can be the
second or succeeding character of an identifier.  This is very close to, but
not quite the same as the official Unicode property C<XID_Continue>.  The
difference is that this returns true only if the input character also matches
L</isWORDCHAR>.  See the L<top of this section|/Character classification> for
an
explanation of variants C<isIDCONT_A>, C<isIDCONT_L1>, C<isIDCONT_uvchr>,
C<isIDCONT_utf8_safe>, C<isIDCONT_LC>, C<isIDCONT_LC_uvchr>, and
C<isIDCONT_LC_utf8_safe>.

=head1 Miscellaneous Functions

=for apidoc Am|U8|READ_XDIGIT|char str*
Returns the value of an ASCII-range hex digit and advances the string pointer.
Behaviour is only well defined when isXDIGIT(*str) is true.

=head1 Character case changing
Perl uses "full" Unicode case mappings.  This means that converting a single
character to another case may result in a sequence of more than one character.
For example, the uppercase of C<E<223>> (LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S) is the two
character sequence C<SS>.  This presents some complications   The lowercase of
all characters in the range 0..255 is a single character, and thus
C<L</toLOWER_L1>> is furnished.  But, C<toUPPER_L1> can't exist, as it couldn't
return a valid result for all legal inputs.  Instead C<L</toUPPER_uvchr>> has
an API that does allow every possible legal result to be returned.)  Likewise
no other function that is crippled by not being able to give the correct
results for the full range of possible inputs has been implemented here.

=for apidoc Am|U8|toUPPER|U8 ch
Converts the specified character to uppercase.  If the input is anything but an
ASCII lowercase character, that input character itself is returned.  Variant
C<toUPPER_A> is equivalent.

=for apidoc Am|UV|toUPPER_uvchr|UV cp|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
Converts the code point C<cp> to its uppercase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  The code
point is interpreted as native if less than 256; otherwise as Unicode.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the uppercase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the uppercased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case
changing>, that there may be more.)

=for apidoc Am|UV|toUPPER_utf8_safe|U8* p|U8* e|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
Converts the first UTF-8 encoded character in the sequence starting at C<p> and
extending no further than S<C<e - 1>> to its uppercase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the uppercase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the uppercased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case
changing>, that there may be more).

The suffix C<_safe> in the function's name indicates that it will not attempt
to read beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is
true (this is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the
input character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the
function may return the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, at the discretion of the
implementation, and subject to change in future releases.

=for apidoc Am|UV|toUPPER_utf8|U8* p|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
This is like C<L</toUPPER_utf8_safe>>, but doesn't have the C<e>
parameter  The function therefore can't check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take the C<e>
parameter, becoming a synonym for C<toUPPER_utf8_safe>.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C<toUPPER_utf8> from each call point in the
program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can convert
your program now to use C<toUPPER_utf8_safe>, and avoid the warnings, and get an
extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when you'll be forced
to add the C<e> parameter.

=for apidoc Am|U8|toFOLD|U8 ch
Converts the specified character to foldcase.  If the input is anything but an
ASCII uppercase character, that input character itself is returned.  Variant
C<toFOLD_A> is equivalent.  (There is no equivalent C<to_FOLD_L1> for the full
Latin1 range, as the full generality of L</toFOLD_uvchr> is needed there.)

=for apidoc Am|UV|toFOLD_uvchr|UV cp|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
Converts the code point C<cp> to its foldcase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  The code
point is interpreted as native if less than 256; otherwise as Unicode.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the foldcase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the foldcased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case
changing>, that there may be more).

=for apidoc Am|UV|toFOLD_utf8_safe|U8* p|U8* e|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
Converts the first UTF-8 encoded character in the sequence starting at C<p> and
extending no further than S<C<e - 1>> to its foldcase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the foldcase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the foldcased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case
changing>, that there may be more).

The suffix C<_safe> in the function's name indicates that it will not attempt
to read beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is
true (this is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the
input character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the
function may return the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, at the discretion of the
implementation, and subject to change in future releases.

=for apidoc Am|UV|toFOLD_utf8|U8* p|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
This is like C<L</toFOLD_utf8_safe>>, but doesn't have the C<e>
parameter  The function therefore can't check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take the C<e>
parameter, becoming a synonym for C<toFOLD_utf8_safe>.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C<toFOLD_utf8> from each call point in the
program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can convert
your program now to use C<toFOLD_utf8_safe>, and avoid the warnings, and get an
extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when you'll be forced
to add the C<e> parameter.

=for apidoc Am|U8|toLOWER|U8 ch
Converts the specified character to lowercase.  If the input is anything but an
ASCII uppercase character, that input character itself is returned.  Variant
C<toLOWER_A> is equivalent.

=for apidoc Am|U8|toLOWER_L1|U8 ch
Converts the specified Latin1 character to lowercase.  The results are
undefined if the input doesn't fit in a byte.

=for apidoc Am|U8|toLOWER_LC|U8 ch
Converts the specified character to lowercase using the current locale's rules,
if possible; otherwise returns the input character itself.

=for apidoc Am|UV|toLOWER_uvchr|UV cp|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
Converts the code point C<cp> to its lowercase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  The code
point is interpreted as native if less than 256; otherwise as Unicode.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the lowercase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the lowercased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case
changing>, that there may be more).


=for apidoc Am|UV|toLOWER_utf8_safe|U8* p|U8* e|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
Converts the first UTF-8 encoded character in the sequence starting at C<p> and
extending no further than S<C<e - 1>> to its lowercase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the lowercase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the lowercased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case
changing>, that there may be more).

The suffix C<_safe> in the function's name indicates that it will not attempt
to read beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is
true (this is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the
input character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the
function may return the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, at the discretion of the
implementation, and subject to change in future releases.

=for apidoc Am|UV|toLOWER_utf8|U8* p|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
This is like C<L</toLOWER_utf8_safe>>, but doesn't have the C<e>
parameter  The function therefore can't check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take the C<e>
parameter, becoming a synonym for C<toLOWER_utf8_safe>.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C<toLOWER_utf8> from each call point in the
program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can convert
your program now to use C<toLOWER_utf8_safe>, and avoid the warnings, and get an
extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when you'll be forced
to add the C<e> parameter.

=for apidoc Am|U8|toTITLE|U8 ch
Converts the specified character to titlecase.  If the input is anything but an
ASCII lowercase character, that input character itself is returned.  Variant
C<toTITLE_A> is equivalent.  (There is no C<toTITLE_L1> for the full Latin1
range, as the full generality of L</toTITLE_uvchr> is needed there.  Titlecase is
not a concept used in locale handling, so there is no functionality for that.)

=for apidoc Am|UV|toTITLE_uvchr|UV cp|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
Converts the code point C<cp> to its titlecase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  The code
point is interpreted as native if less than 256; otherwise as Unicode.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the titlecase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the titlecased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case
changing>, that there may be more).

=for apidoc Am|UV|toTITLE_utf8_safe|U8* p|U8* e|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
Converts the first UTF-8 encoded character in the sequence starting at C<p> and
extending no further than S<C<e - 1>> to its titlecase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the titlecase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the titlecased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case
changing>, that there may be more).

The suffix C<_safe> in the function's name indicates that it will not attempt
to read beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is
true (this is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the
input character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the
function may return the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, at the discretion of the
implementation, and subject to change in future releases.

=for apidoc Am|UV|toTITLE_utf8|U8* p|U8* s|STRLEN* lenp
This is like C<L</toLOWER_utf8_safe>>, but doesn't have the C<e>
parameter  The function therefore can't check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take the C<e>
parameter, becoming a synonym for C<toTITLE_utf8_safe>.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C<toTITLE_utf8> from each call point in the
program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can convert
your program now to use C<toTITLE_utf8_safe>, and avoid the warnings, and get an
extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when you'll be forced
to add the C<e> parameter.

XXX Still undocumented isVERTWS_uvchr and _utf8; it's unclear what their names
really should be.  Also toUPPER_LC and toFOLD_LC, which are subject to change,
and aren't general purpose as they don't work on U+DF, and assert against that.

Note that these macros are repeated in Devel::PPPort, so should also be
patched there.  The file as of this writing is cpan/Devel-PPPort/parts/inc/misc

=head1 Memory Management

=for apidoc Am|void|Newx|void* ptr|int nitems|type
The XSUB-writer's interface to the C C<malloc> function.

Memory obtained by this should B<ONLY> be freed with L</"Safefree">.

In 5.9.3, Newx() and friends replace the older New() API, and drops
the first parameter, I<x>, a debug aid which allowed callers to identify
themselves.  This aid has been superseded by a new build option,
PERL_MEM_LOG (see L<perlhacktips/PERL_MEM_LOG>).  The older API is still
there for use in XS modules supporting older perls.

=for apidoc Am|void|Newxc|void* ptr|int nitems|type|cast
The XSUB-writer's interface to the C C<malloc> function, with
cast.  See also C<L</Newx>>.

Memory obtained by this should B<ONLY> be freed with L</"Safefree">.

=for apidoc Am|void|Newxz|void* ptr|int nitems|type
The XSUB-writer's interface to the C C<malloc> function.  The allocated
memory is zeroed with C<memzero>.  See also C<L</Newx>>.

Memory obtained by this should B<ONLY> be freed with L</"Safefree">.

=for apidoc Am|void|Renew|void* ptr|int nitems|type
The XSUB-writer's interface to the C C<realloc> function.

Memory obtained by this should B<ONLY> be freed with L</"Safefree">.

=for apidoc Am|void|Renewc|void* ptr|int nitems|type|cast
The XSUB-writer's interface to the C C<realloc> function, with
cast.

Memory obtained by this should B<ONLY> be freed with L</"Safefree">.

=for apidoc Am|void|Safefree|void* ptr
The XSUB-writer's interface to the C C<free> function.

This should B<ONLY> be used on memory obtained using L</"Newx"> and friends.

=for apidoc Am|void|Move|void* src|void* dest|int nitems|type
The XSUB-writer's interface to the C C<memmove> function.  The C<src> is the
source, C<dest> is the destination, C<nitems> is the number of items, and
C<type> is the type.  Can do overlapping moves.  See also C<L</Copy>>.

=for apidoc Am|void *|MoveD|void* src|void* dest|int nitems|type
Like C<Move> but returns C<dest>.  Useful
for encouraging compilers to tail-call
optimise.

=for apidoc Am|void|Copy|void* src|void* dest|int nitems|type
The XSUB-writer's interface to the C C<memcpy> function.  The C<src> is the
source, C<dest> is the destination, C<nitems> is the number of items, and
C<type> is the type.  May fail on overlapping copies.  See also C<L</Move>>.

=for apidoc Am|void *|CopyD|void* src|void* dest|int nitems|type

Like C<Copy> but returns C<dest>.  Useful
for encouraging compilers to tail-call
optimise.

=for apidoc Am|void|Zero|void* dest|int nitems|type

The XSUB-writer's interface to the C C<memzero> function.  The C<dest> is the
destination, C<nitems> is the number of items, and C<type> is the type.

=for apidoc Am|void *|ZeroD|void* dest|int nitems|type

Like C<Zero> but returns dest.  Useful
for encouraging compilers to tail-call
optimise.

=for apidoc Am|void|StructCopy|type *src|type *dest|type
This is an architecture-independent macro to copy one structure to another.

=for apidoc Am|void|PoisonWith|void* dest|int nitems|type|U8 byte

Fill up memory with a byte pattern (a byte repeated over and over
again) that hopefully catches attempts to access uninitialized memory.

=for apidoc Am|void|PoisonNew|void* dest|int nitems|type

PoisonWith(0xAB) for catching access to allocated but uninitialized memory.

=for apidoc Am|void|PoisonFree|void* dest|int nitems|type

PoisonWith(0xEF) for catching access to freed memory.

=for apidoc Am|void|Poison|void* dest|int nitems|type

PoisonWith(0xEF) for catching access to freed memory.
