/*
 * Structure for regexp "program".  This is essentially a linear encoding
 * of a nondeterministic finite-state machine (aka syntax charts or
 * "railroad normal form" in parsing technology).  Each node is an opcode
 * plus a "next" pointer, possibly plus an operand.  "Next" pointers of
 * all nodes except BRANCH implement concatenation; a "next" pointer with
 * a BRANCH on both ends of it is connecting two alternatives.  (Here we
 * have one of the subtle syntax dependencies:  an individual BRANCH (as
 * opposed to a collection of them) is never concatenated with anything
 * because of operator precedence.)  The operand of some types of node is
 * a literal string; for others, it is a node leading into a sub-FSM.  In
 * particular, the operand of a BRANCH node is the first node of the branch.
 * (NB this is *not* a tree structure:  the tail of the branch connects
 * to the thing following the set of BRANCHes.)  The opcodes are defined
 * in regnodes.h which is generated from regcomp.sym by regcomp.pl.
 */

/*
 * A node is one char of opcode followed by two chars of "next" pointer.
 * "Next" pointers are stored as two 8-bit pieces, high order first.  The
 * value is a positive offset from the opcode of the node containing it.
 * An operand, if any, simply follows the node.  (Note that much of the
 * code generation knows about this implicit relationship.)
 *
 * Using two bytes for the "next" pointer is vast overkill for most things,
 * but allows patterns to get big without disasters.
 *
 * [The "next" pointer is always aligned on an even
 * boundary, and reads the offset directly as a short.]

/* Define the various regnode structures. These all should be a multiple
 * of 32 bits large, and they should by and large correspond with each other
 * in terms of naming, etc. Things can and will break in subtle ways if you
 * change things without care. If you look at regexp.h you will see it
 * contains this:
 *
 * struct regnode {
 *   U8  flags;
 *   U8  type;
 *   U16 next_off;
 * };
 *
 * This structure is the base unit of elements in the regexp program. When
 * we increment our way through the program we increment by the size of this
 * structure, and in all cases where regnode sizing is considered it is in
 * units of this structure.
 *
 * This implies that no regnode style structure should contain 64 bit
 * aligned members. Since the base regnode is 32 bits any member might
 * not be 64 bit aligned no matter how you might try to pad out the
 * struct itself (the regnode_ssc is special in this regard as it is
 * never used in a program directly). If you want to store 64 bit
 * members you need to store them specially. The struct regnode_p and the
 * ARGp() and ARGp_SET() macros and related inline functions provide an example
 * solution. Note they deal with a slightly more complicated problem than simple
 * alignment, as pointers may be 32 bits or 64 bits depending on platform,
 * but they illustrate the pattern to follow if you want to put a 64 bit value
 * into a regnode.

 * NOTE: Ideally we do not put pointers into the regnodes in a program. Instead
 * we put them in the "data" part of the regexp structure and store the index into
 * the data in the pointers in the regnode. This allows the pointer to be handled
 * properly during clone/free operations (eg refcount bookkeeping). See S_add_data(),
 * Perl_regdupe_internal(), Perl_regfree_internal() in regcomp.c for how the data
 * array can be used, the letters 'arsSu' all refer to different types of SV that
 * we already have support for in the data array.

 * indicates if the bitmap does fully represent what this ANYOF node can match.
 * The ARG is set to this special value (since 0, 1, ... are legal, but will
 * never reach this high). */
#define ANYOF_ONLY_HAS_BITMAP	((U32) -1)

/* When the bitmap isn't completely sufficient for handling the ANYOF node,
 * flags (in node->flags of the ANYOF node) get set to indicate this.  These
 * are perennially in short supply.  Beyond several cases where warnings need
 * to be raised under certain circumstances, currently, there are six cases
 * where the bitmap alone isn't sufficient.  We could use six flags to
 * represent the 6 cases, but to save flags bits, we play some games.  The
 * cases are:
 *
 *  1)  The bitmap has a compiled-in very finite size.  So something else needs
 *      to be used to specify if a code point that is too large for the bitmap
 *      actually matches.  The mechanism currently is an inversion
 *      list.  ANYOF_ONLY_HAS_BITMAP, described above, being TRUE indicates
 *      there are no matches of too-large code points.  But if it is FALSE,
 *      then almost certainly there are matches too large for the bitmap.  (The
 *      other cases, described below, either imply this one or are extremely
 *      rare in practice.)  So we can just assume that a too-large code point
 *      will need something beyond the bitmap if ANYOF_ONLY_HAS_BITMAP is
 *      FALSE, instead of having a separate flag for this.
 *  2)  A subset of item 1) is if all possible code points outside the bitmap
 *      match.  This is a common occurrence when the class is complemented,
 *      like /[^ij]/.  Therefore a bit is reserved to indicate this,
 *      rather than having an inversion list created,
 *      ANYOF_MATCHES_ALL_ABOVE_BITMAP.
 *  3)  Under /d rules, it can happen that code points that are in the upper
 *      latin1 range (\x80-\xFF or their equivalents on EBCDIC platforms) match
 *      only if the runtime target string being matched against is UTF-8.  For
 *      example /[\w[:punct:]]/d.  This happens only for posix classes (with a
 *      couple of exceptions, like \d where it doesn't happen), and all such
 *      ones also have above-bitmap matches.  Thus, 3) implies 1) as well.
 *      Note that /d rules are no longer encouraged; 'use 5.14' or higher
 *      deselects them.  But a flag is required so that they can be properly
 *      handled.  But it can be a shared flag: see 5) below.
 *  4)  Also under /d rules, something like /[\Wfoo]/ will match everything in
 *      the \x80-\xFF range, unless the string being matched against is UTF-8.
 *      An inversion list could be created for this case, but this is
 *      relatively common, and it turns out that it's all or nothing:  if any
 *      one of these code points matches, they all do.  Hence a single bit
 *      suffices.  We use a shared flag that doesn't take up space by itself:
 *      ANYOF_SHARED_d_MATCHES_ALL_NON_UTF8_NON_ASCII_non_d_WARN_SUPER.  This
 *      also implies 1), with one exception: [:^cntrl:].
 *  5)  A user-defined \p{} property may not have been defined by the time the
 *      regex is compiled.  In this case, we don't know until runtime what it
 *      will match, so we have to assume it could match anything, including
 *      code points that ordinarily would be in the bitmap.  A flag bit is
 *      necessary to indicate this, though it can be shared with the item 3)
 *      flag, as that only occurs under /d, and this only occurs under non-d.
 *      This case is quite uncommon in the field, and the /(?[ ...])/ construct
 *      is a better way to accomplish what this feature does.  This case also
 *      implies 1).
 *      ANYOF_SHARED_d_UPPER_LATIN1_UTF8_STRING_MATCHES_non_d_RUNTIME_USER_PROP
 *      is the shared flag.
 *  6)  /[foo]/il may have folds that are only valid if the runtime locale is a
 *      UTF-8 one.  These are quite rare, so it would be good to avoid the
 *      expense of looking for them.  But /l matching is slow anyway, and we've
 *      traditionally not worried too much about its performance.  And this
 *      condition requires the ANYOFL_FOLD flag to be set, so testing for
 *      that flag would be sufficient to rule out most cases of this.  So it is
 *      unclear if this should have a flag or not.  But, this flag can be
 *      shared with another, so it doesn't occupy extra space.
 *
 * At the moment, there is one spare bit, but this could be increased by
 * various tricks:
 *
 * If just one more bit is needed, as of this writing it seems to khw that the
 * best choice would be to make ANYOF_MATCHES_ALL_ABOVE_BITMAP not a flag, but
 * something like
 *
 *      #define ANYOF_MATCHES_ALL_ABOVE_BITMAP      ((U32) -2)
 *
 * and access it through the ARG like ANYOF_ONLY_HAS_BITMAP is.  This flag is
 * used by all ANYOF node types, and it could be used to avoid calling the
 * handler function, as the macro REGINCLASS in regexec.c does now for other
 * cases.
 *
 * Another possibility is based on the fact that ANYOF_MATCHES_POSIXL is
 * redundant with the node type ANYOFPOSIXL.  That flag could be removed, but
 * at the expense of extra code in regexec.c.  The flag has been retained
 * because it allows us to see if we need to call reginclass, or just use the
 * bitmap in one test.
 *
 * If this is done, an extension would be to make all ANYOFL nodes contain the
 * extra 32 bits that ANYOFPOSIXL ones do.  The posix flags only occupy 30
 * bits, so the ANYOFL_SHARED_UTF8_LOCALE_fold_HAS_MATCHES_nonfold_REQD flags
 * and ANYOFL_FOLD could be moved to that extra space, but it would mean extra
 * instructions, as there are currently places in the code that assume those
 * two bits are zero.
 *
 * All told, 5 bits could be available for other uses if all of the above were
 * done.
 *
 * Some flags are not used in synthetic start class (SSC) nodes, so could be
 * shared should new flags be needed for SSCs, like SSC_MATCHES_EMPTY_STRING
 * now. */
