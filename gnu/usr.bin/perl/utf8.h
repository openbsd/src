Note the gaps before several of the byte entries above marked by '*'.  These are
caused by legal UTF-8 avoiding non-shortest encodings: it is technically
possible to UTF-8-encode a single code point in different ways, but that is
explicitly forbidden, and the shortest possible encoding should always be used
(and that is what Perl does).  The non-shortest ones are called 'overlongs'.

 Another way to look at it, as bits:

 00 000d ddcc cccc bbbb bbaa aaaa  1111 0ddd  10cc cccc  10bb bbbb  10aa aaaa

As you can see, the continuation bytes all begin with C<10>, and the
leading bits of the start byte tell how many bytes there are in the
encoded character.

Perl's extended UTF-8 means we can have start bytes up to FF.

Returns the number of bytes beginning at C<s> which form a legal UTF-8 (or
UTF-EBCDIC) encoded character, looking no further than S<C<e - s>> bytes into
C<s>.  Returns 0 if the sequence starting at C<s> through S<C<e - 1>> is not
well-formed UTF-8.

Note that an INVARIANT character (i.e. ASCII on non-EBCDIC
machines) is a valid UTF-8 character.
