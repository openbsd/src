=head1 NAME

perlepigraphs - list of Perl release epigraphs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Many Perl release announcements included an I<epigraph>, a short excerpt
from a literary or other creative work, chosen by the pumpking or release
manager.  This file assembles the known list of epigraph for posterity,
and also links to the release announcements in mailing list archives.

I<Note>: these have also been referred to as I<epigrams>, but the
definition of I<epigraph> is closer to the way they have been used.

When I became acquainted with the notion of algorithmic languages I
never challenged the then prevailing notion that the problems of
language design and implementation were mostly a question of
compromises: every new convenience for the user had to be paid for
by the implementation, either in the form of increased trouble
during translation, or during execution or during both. Well, we
are most certainly not living in Heaven and I am not going to deny
the possibility of a conflict between convenience and efficiency,
but now I do protest when this conflict is presented as a complete
summing up of the situation. I am of the opinion that is worth-while
to investigate what extent the needs of Man and Machine go hand in
hand and to see what techniques we can devise of the benefit of all
of us. I trust that this investigation will bear fruits and if this
talk made some of you share this fervent hope, it has achieved its aim.

=head2 v5.29.6 - Rudyard Kipling: "How the Camel Got His Hump"

L<Announced on 2018-12-18 by Abigail|https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2018/12/msg253187.html>

  The Camel's hump is an ugly lump
    Which well you may see at the Zoo;
  But uglier yet is the hump we get
    From having little to do.

  Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo
  If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,
        We get the hump -
        Cameelious hump -
  The hump that is black and blue!

  We climb out of bed with a frouzly head
    And a snarly-yarly voice.
  We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl
    At our bath and our boots and our toys;

  And there ought to be a corner for me
  (And I know there is one for you)
        When we get the hump -
        Cameelious hump -
  The hump that is black and blue!

  The cure for this ill is to not sit still,
    Or frowst with a book by the fire;
  But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,
    And dig till you gentle perspire;

  And then you will find that the sun and the wind,
  And the Djinn of the Garden too,
        Have lifted the hump -
        The horrible hump -
  The hump that is black and blue!

  I get it as well as you-oo-oo -
  If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo!
        We all get hump -
        Cameelious hump -
  Kiddies and grown-ups too!


=head2 v5.29.5 - T. S. Eliot, "The Naming Of Cats"

L<Announced on 2018-11-20 by Karen Etheridge|https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2018/11/msg252839.html>

  The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,
  It isn't just one of your holiday games;
  You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter
  When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
  First of all, there's the name that the family use daily,
  Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James,
  Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey--
  All of them sensible everyday names.
  There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
  Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:
  Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter--
  But all of them sensible everyday names.
  But I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular,
  A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,
  Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,
  Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?
  Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,
  Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,
  Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum-
  Names that never belong to more than one cat.
  But above and beyond there's still one name left over,
  And that is the name that you never will guess;
  The name that no human research can discover--
  But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
  When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
  The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
  His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
  Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
  His ineffable effable
  Effanineffable
  Deep and inscrutable singular Name.

  Well
  Guy in a skeleton costume
  Comes up to the guy in the Superman suit
  Runs through him with a broadsword
  I flipped the television off
  Bring all the bright lights up
  Turn the radio up loud
  I don't know why I'm so persuaded
  That if I think things through
  Long enough and hard enough
  I'll somehow get to you
  But then you came in and we locked eyes
  You kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other
  Stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall
  Quickly lit another
  Look at that
  Would you look at that?
  We're throwing off sparks
  What will I do when I don't have you
  To hold onto in the dark?

  Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood.

  If you're reading this because you think you might be one,
  my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever
  lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try
  to lead a normal life.

  Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time,
  it gets you killed in painful, nasty ways.

  If you're a normal kid, reading this because you think it's
  fiction, great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe
  that none of this ever happened.

  But if you recognize yourself in these pages - if you feel
  something stirring inside - stop reading immediately.
  You might be one of us. And once you know that, it's only a
  matter of time before they sense it too, and they'll come for you.

  Blackadder: (to Prince) Oh, well, in that case, sir, I hope you will
  not object if I also offer the Doctor my most enthusiastic
  contrafribularities.

  Johnson: What?

  Blackadder: 'Contrafribularities,' sir? It is a common word down our
  way.

  Johnson: Damn! (writes in the book)

  Blackadder: Oh, I'm sorry, sir.  I'm anaspeptic, phrasmotic, even

  On the top of the Crumpetty Tree
    The Quangle Wangle sat,
  But his face you could not see,
    On account of his Beaver Hat.
  For his Hat was a hundred and two feet wide,
  With ribbons and bibbons on every side,
  And bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,
  So that nobody ever could see the face
      Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.

=head2 v5.28.1 - Humphrey Burton, "Leonard Bernstein"

L<Announced on 2018-11-29 by Steve Hay|http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2018/11/msg252975.html>

On August 25, 1983, Leonard Bernstein celebrated his sixty-fifth
birthday in his birthplace, Lawrence, Massachusetts.  He had actually
lived in the town for only a few weeks as a newborn baby, and had last
visited it forty-nine years previously, in 1934, to get the name on his
birth certificate altered from Louis to Leonard.  But the citizens of
Lawrence proposed to dedicate an outdoor theater to him in their
heritage park and to provide not one but two local orchestras--the
Merrimack Valley Philharmonic to play excerpts from his own compositions
and the Greater Boston Youth Symphony and Chorus to perform the "Ode to
Joy" and accompany Bernstein himself reading (for the only time in his
life) the text of A Lincoln Portrait.  So Bernstein turned down birthday
invitations from Tanglewood and Central Park, New York, and the
Hollywood Bowl and drove through the cheering if slightly bewildered
crowds lining the streets of Lawrence in an open-topped 1928 Ford
roadster, looking as homespun as James Stewart in Frank Capra's classic,
It's a Wonderful Life.

  When we look at modern man we have to face the fact that modern man
  suffers from a kind of poverty of the spirit which stands in glaring
  contrast with his scientific and technological abundance. We've learned
  to fly the air as birds, we've learned to swim the seas as fish, yet we
  haven't learned to walk the earth as brothers and sisters.

  You're alive, Bod. That means you have infinite potential. You can do
  anything, make anything, dream anything. If you can change the world,
  the world will change. Potential. Once you're dead, it's gone. Over.
  You've made what you've made, dreamed your dream, written your name.
  You may be buried here, you may even walk. But that potential is
  finished.

  Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more
  than five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity.
  His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it
  a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military.
  The neatness of his attire was almost incredible. I believe a
  speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound.
  Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now
  limped badly, had been in his time one of the most celebrated members
  of the Belgian police. As a detective, his flair had been extraordinary,
  and he had achieved triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling
  cases of the day.
    He pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow
  Belgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he
  raised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.
    "He's a dear little man," said Cynthia. "I'd no idea you knew him."
    "You've been entertaining a celebrity unawares," I replied.
    And, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various
  exploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.

  Death looked at the sacks.

  It was a strange but demonstrable fact that the sacks of
  toys carried by the Hogfather, no matter what they
  really contained, always appeared to have sticking out
  of the top a teddy bear, a toy soldier in the kind of
  colorful uniform that would stand out in a disco, a
  drum and a red-and-white candy cane. The actual
  contents always turned out to be something a bit
  garish and costing $5.99.

  Death had investigated one or two. There had been a
  Real Agatean Ninja, for example, with Fearsome
  Death Grip, and a Captain Carrot One-Man Night
  Watch with a complete wardrobe of toy weapons, each
  of which cost as much as the original wooden doll in
  the first place.

  Mind you, the stuff for the girls was just as
  depressing. It seemed to be nearly all horses. Most of
  them were grinning. Horses, Death felt, shouldn't grin.

  Any horse that was grinning was planning something.

    'But where is the Directional room?' she inquired, bewildered.
    'Why, there of course,' howled the Waterflap, pointing to a door.
    'How could I possibly know that!' Alice exclaimed, angered by his

    'Silly girl,' it hissed. 'Why, it's called the Directional room

  He went back for another stack of books: a three-volume English legal
  treatise; a travel guide to Tuscany from the '20s crammed with faded
  Italian wildflowers that fluttered out from between the pages like
  moths; a French edition of Turgeniev so decayed that it came apart in
  his hands; a register of London society from 1863. In a way it was
  idiotic. He was treating these books like they were holy relics. It
  wasn't like he would ever actually read them. But there was something
  magnetic about them, something that compelled respect, even the silly
  ones, like the Enlightenment treatise about how lightning was caused
  by bees. They were information, data, but not in the form he was used
  to dealing with it. They were non-digital, nonelectrical chunks of
  memory, not stamped out of silicon but laboriously crafted out of wood
  pulp and ink, leather and glue. Somebody had cared enough to write
  these things; somebody else had cared enough to buy them, possibly
  even read them, at the very least keep them safe for 150 years,
  sometimes longer, when they could have vanished at the touch of a
  spark. That made them worth something, didn't it, just by itself?
  Though most of them would have bored him rigid the second he cracked
  them open, which there wasn't much chance of. Maybe that was what he
  found so appealing: the sight of so many books that he'd never have to
  read, so much work he'd never have to do.

  People who have theories as to how one should live tend to forget the
  limitations of nature. If your way of life involves constant
  restraint of impulse for the sake of some one supreme aim that you
  have set yourself, it is likely that the aim will become increasingly
  distasteful because of the efforts that it demands; impulse, denied
  its normal outlets, will find others, probably in spite; pleasure, if
  you allow yourself any at all, will be dissociated from the main
  current of your life, and will become Bacchic and frivolous. Such
  pleasure brings no happiness, but only a deeper despair.

=head2 v5.26.3 - Humphrey Burton, "Leonard Bernstein"

L<Announced on 2018-11-29 by Steve Hay|http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2018/11/msg252974.html>

The origins of the name "Bernstein" are sometimes linked with the German
noun Bernstein, which means "amber"--a translucent yellowish fossilized
resin, used for ornaments and thought to possess magical properties.
Leonard Bernstein would later call himself "Lenny Amber" when he needed
a pseudonym for the popular piano transcriptions he published in his
mid-twenties, and his business affairs would be organized within a
company called Amberson Enterprises.  There are several towns and
villages named Bernstein in Germany and Austria (where the pronunciation
is BernSTINE), but Bernstein's parents came from Jewish ghettos in
northwestern Ukraine, where the last syllable is usually pronounced
BernSHTAYN or STEEN.  Sam insisted, however, on the mid-European style
employed by the earlier immigrants.

L<Announced on 2018-04-14 by Steve Hay|http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2018/04/msg250440.html>

How does a cat use its whiskers?  The usual answer is that the whiskers
are feelers that enable a cat to tell whether a gap is wide enough for
it to squeeze through, but the truth is more complicated and more
remarkable.  In addition to their obvious role as feelers sensitive to
touch, the whiskers also operate as air-current detectors.  As the cat
moves along in the dark it needs to manoeuvre past solid objects without
touching them.  Each solid object it approaches causes slight eddies in
the air, minute disturbances in the currents of air movements, and the
cat's whiskers are so amazingly sensitive that they can read these air
changes and respond to the presence of solid obstacles even without
touching them.

L<Announced on 2018-03-24 by Steve Hay|http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2018/03/msg250103.html>

Cats have a way of endearing themselves to their owners, not just by
their 'kittenoid' behaviour, which stimulates strong parental feelings,
but also by their sheer gracefulness. There is an elegance and a
composure about them that captivates the human eye. To the sensitive
human being it becomes a privilege to share a room with a cat, exchange
its glance, feel its greeting rub, or watch it gently luxuriate itself

  And soon I heard a roaring wind:
  It did not come anear;
  But with its sound it shook the sails,
  That were so thin and sere.

  The upper air burst into life!
  And a hundred fire-flags sheen,
  To and fro they were hurried about!
  And to and fro, and in and out,
  The wan stars danced between.

  At length did cross an Albatross,
  Thorough the fog it came;
  As if it had been a Christian soul,
  We hailed it in God's name.

  It ate the food it ne'er had eat,
  And round and round it flew.
  The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
  The helmsman steered us through!

  And a good south wind sprung up behind;
  The Albatross did follow,
  And every day, for food or play,
  Came to the mariner's hollo!

  In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,
  It perched for vespers nine;
  Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,
  Glimmered the white Moon-shine.'

  'God save thee, ancient Mariner!
  From the fiends, that plague thee thus!—
  Why look'st thou so?'—With my cross-bow
  I shot the ALBATROSS.

  Subjective confidence in a judgment is not a reasoned evaluation of
  the probability that this judgment is correct. Confidence is a
  feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the
  cognitive ease of processing it. It is wise to take admissions of

  tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his

  Concerning Nomes and Time

  Nomes are small. On the whole, small creatures don't live for a long
  time. But perhaps they do live fast.

  Let me explain.

  One of the shortest-lived creatures on the planet Earth is the adult
  common mayfly. It lasts for one day. The longest-living things are
  bristlecone pine trees, at 4,700 years and still counting.

  This may seem tough on the mayflies. But the important thing is not
  how long your life is, but how long it seems.

  To a mayfly, a single hour may last as long as a century. Perhaps
  old mayflies sit around complaining about how life this minute isn't a
  patch on the good old minutes of long ago, when the world was
  young and the sun seemed so much brighter and larvae showed you a
  bit of respect. Whereas the trees, which are not famous to their
  quick reactions, may just have time to notice the way the sky keeps
  flickering before the dry rot and woodworm set in.

  It's all a sort of relativity. The faster you live, the more time
  stretches out. To a nome, a year lasts as long as ten years does to a
  human. Remember it. Don't let it concern you. They don't. They don't
  even know.

  And ever as onward it gleaming goes
  A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws.

  From Hall or Terrace, or lofty Tower,

Imagine that you're a smart high school student on the low end of the social
totem pole. You're alienated from adult authority, but unlike many teenagers,
you're also alienated from the power structures of your peers -- an existence
that can feel lonely and peripheral. Systems and equations are intuitive, but
people aren't -- social signals are confusing and messy, difficult to interpret.

Then you discover code. You may be powerless at the lunch table, but code
gives you power over an infinitely malleable world and opens the door to a
symbolic system that's perfectly clear and ordered. The jostling for position
and status fades away. The nagging parental voices disappear. There's just a
clean, white page for you to fill, an opportunity to build a better place, a
home, from the ground up.

No wonder you're a geek.

Cats hate doors.  Doors simply do not register in the evolutionary story
of the cat family.  They constantly block patrolling activities and
prevent cats from exploring their home range and then returning to their
central, secure base at will.  Humans often do not understand that a cat
needs to make only a brief survey of its territory before returning with
all the necessary information about the activities of other cats in the
vicinity.  It likes to make these tours of inspection at frequent
intervals, but does not want to stay outside for very long, unless there
has been some special and unexpected change in the condition of the
local feline population.

The domestic cat is a contradiction. No animal has developed such an
intimate relationship with mankind, while at the same time demanding and
getting such independence of movement and action. The dog may be man's
best friend, but it is rarely allowed out on its own to wander from
garden to garden or street to street. The obedient dog has to be taken
for a walk. The headstrong cat walks alone.

    Before the gates there sat
  On either side a formidable shape;
  The one seemed woman to the waste, and fair,
  But ended foul in many a scaly fold,
  Voluminous and vast -- a serpent armed
  With mortal sting; about her middle round
  A cry of hell hounds never ceasing barked
  With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung
  A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep,
  If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,
  And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled
  Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these
  Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts
  Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore;
  Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called

  For each seemed either -- black it stood as night,
  Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as hell,
  And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head
  The likeness of a kingly crown had on.
  Satan was now at hand, and from his seat
  The monster moving onward came as fast

“Fine. No, I’m very frightened.”

“That’s good,” said Major Danby. “It proves you’re still alive. It won’t

Yossarian started out. “Yes it will.”

“I mean it, Yossarian. You’ll have to keep on your toes every minute of

Spring

Spring is the proper beginning of my kitchen and a season that I
look forward to with great anticipation. By the time spring arrives
I am desperate to welcome all the spring produce into my kitchen
and I long to work with fresh green vegetables again. As much as I
love root vegetables, such as celeriac and parsnips, and the heaver
meat and game dishes, I'm ready to leave those behind with winter
and begin a new adventure.

Somehow spring always gives me a little bit of bounce in my feet
-- I feel like I want to kick off my shoes and dance around in my
kitchen. Not that I do, of course, but I feel lighter somehow. My
adrenalin kicks in with spring and so does the level of excitement,
as I think about all the produce that is about to come in.

The moment spring arrives I'm eager to cook peas, broad beans, green
asparagus and other fresh vegetables! I want to create lighter,
brighter dishes and I can't wait to get my hands on the first greens
and the first morels, not to mention the first wild Scottish salmon.
Thanks to my network of trusted suppliers, I always get to first
produce of the season delivered to my restaurant as soon as it is
possible. I want my customers to experience and understand the
beauty of locally grown produce and to try things the minute they
are available so they can taste how incredibly fresh the ingredients
are. I also want them to understand the relationship between
seasonality and flavours. One of the most important things to
remember is to allow the seasons to inspire your dishes and help
you make natural matches. Wild spring herbs, such as sorrel, sweet
cicely and wild garlic, as well as spring salad leaves and green
lettuce served with wild salmon, wild sea trout, lamb or rabbit are
marriages made in heaven.

Denna, on the other hand, had never been trained. She knew nothing
of shortcuts. You'd think she'd be forced to wander the city, lost and
helpless, trapped in a twisting maze of mortared stone.

But instead, she simply walked throught the walls. She didn't know
any better. Nobody had ever told her she couldn't. Because of this,
she moved through the city like some faerie creature. She walked roads
no one else could see, and it made her music wild and strange and

After Mel had left the company for greener pa$ture$, the Big Boss asked
me to look at the code and see if I could find the test and reverse it.
Somewhat reluctantly, I agreed to look. Tracking Mel's code was a real
adventure.

I have often felt that programming is an art form, whose real value can
only be appreciated by another versed in the same arcane art; there are
lovely gems and brilliant coups hidden from human view and admiration,
sometimes forever, by the very nature of the process. You can learn a
lot about an individual just by reading through his code, even in
hexadecimal. Mel was, I think, an unsung genius.

Perhaps my greatest shock came when I found an innocent loop that had
no test in it. No test. None. Common sense said it had to be a closed
loop, where the program would circle, forever, endlessly. Program
control passed right through it, however, and safely out the other side.
It took me two weeks to figure it out.

The RPC-4000 computer had a really modern facility called an index
register. It allowed the programmer to write a program loop that used
an indexed instruction inside; each time through, the number in the
index register was added to the address of that instruction, so it
would refer to the next datum in a series. He had only to increment
the index register each time through. Mel never used it.

Instead, he would pull the instruction into a machine register, add one
to its address, and store it back. He would then execute the modified
instruction right from the register. The loop was written so this
additional execution time was taken into account -- just as this
instruction finished, the next one was right under the drum's read head,
ready to go. But the loop had no test in it.

The vital clue came when I noticed the index register bit, the bit that
lay between the address and the operation code in the instruction word,
was turned on -- yet Mel never used the index register, leaving it zero
all the time. When the light went on it nearly blinded me.

He had located the data he was working on near the top of memory -- the
largest locations the instructions could address -- so, after the last
datum was handled, incrementing the instruction address would make it
overflow. The carry would add one to the operation code, changing it to
the next one in the instruction set: a jump instruction. Sure enough,
the next program instruction was in address location zero, and the
program went happily on its way.

  I was born beneath this willow,
  Where my sire the earth did farm
  Had the green grass as my pillow
  The east wind as a blanket warm.

  But away! away! called the wind from the west
  And in answer I did run
  Seeking glory and adventure
  Promised by the rising sun.

  I found love beneath this willow,
  As true a love as life could hold,
  Pledged my heart and swore my fealty
  Sealed with a kiss and a band of gold.

  But to arms! to arms! called the wind from the west
  In faithful answer I did run
  Marching forth for king and country
  In battles 'neath the midday sun.

  Oft I dreamt of that fair willow
  As the seven seas I plied
  And the girl who I left waiting
  Longing to be at her side.

  But about! about! called the wind from the west
  As once again my ship did run
  Down the coast, about the wide world
  Flying sails in the setting sun.

  Now I lie beneath the willow
  Now at last no more to roam,
  My bride and earth so tightly hold me
  In their arms I'm finally home.

  While away! away! calls the wind from the west
  Beyond the grave my spirit, free
  Will chase the sun into the morning
  Beyond the sky, beyond the sea.

  As one who strives a hill to climb,
    Who never climbed before:
  Who finds it, in a little time,
  Grow every moment less sublime,
    And votes the thing a bore:

  Yet, having once begun to try,
    Dares not desert his quest,
  But, climbing, ever keeps his eye
  On one small hut against the sky
    Wherein he hopes to rest:

  Who climbs till nerve and force are spent,
    With many a puff and pant:
  Who still, as rises the ascent,
  In language grows more violent,
    Although in breath more scant:

  Who, climbing, gains at length the place
    That crowns the upward track:
  And, entering with unsteady pace,
  Receives a buffet in the face
    That lands him on his back:

  And feels himself, like one in sleep,
    Glide swiftly down again,
  A helpless weight, from steep to steep,
  Till, with a headlong giddy sweep,
    He drops upon the plain -

  So I, that had resolved to bring
    Conviction to a ghost,
  And found it quite a different thing
  From any human arguing,
    Yet dared not quit my post.

  Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry
  The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song;
  As lightly from his grassy couch up rose
  Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream;
  Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked.
  Up to a hill anon his steps he reared,
  From whose high top to ken the prospect round,
  If cottage were in view, sheep-cote, or herd;
  But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw --
  Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove,
  With chant of tuneful birds resounding loud;
  Thither he bent his way, determined there
  To rest at noon, and entered soon the shade,
  High-roofed and walks beneath, and alleys brown,

  Far off from these, a slow and silent stream,
  Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls
  Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks
  Forthwith his former state and being forgets --
  Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
  Beyond this flood a frozen continent
  Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms
  Of Whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land
  Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems
  Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,
  A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog
  Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,
  Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air
  Burns frore, and cold performs the effect of fire.
  Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled,
  At certain revolutions all the damned
  Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change
  Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,
  From beds of raging fire to starve in ice
  Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine
  Immovable, infixed, and frozen round
  Periods of time -- thence hurried back to fire.
  They ferry over this Lethean sound
  Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment,
  And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach
  The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose
  In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,
  All in one moment, and so near the brink;
  But fate withstands, and, to oppose the attempt,
  Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards
  The ford, and of itself the water flies
  All taste of living wight, as once it fled
  The lip of Tantalus.

  Like the great landslide that rushed downward, shaking

  So that the rock, down from the summit rent
    Far as the plain, lies strewn, and one might crawl

  Such was the precipice; and there we spied,
    Topping the cleft that split the rocky wall,

A silence; and then: 'If, in just two minutes' time by my watch--and a
splendid watch it is--you have not turned the scorpion, mademoiselle, I
shall turn the grasshopper... and the grasshopper, remember, _leaps
straight up into the air!_'
The silence that ensued was terrifying, worse than any we had
experienced before.  I knew that when Erik spoke with that quiet,
gentle, slightly weary voice, it meant that he had reached the end of
his tether: that he was capable of the most abominable crimes or the
most selfless devotion; that the slightest irritation might unleash a
storm.
Realizing that our fate was out of our hands, the Viscount fell to his
knees and prayed.  As for me, I pressed both hands to my chest, for my
heart was pounding so fiercely that I thought it would burst.  We were
intensely aware of the excruciating dilemma Christine Daaé faced in
those final seconds.  We understood why she hesitated to turn the
scorpion.  What if the scorpion, rather than the grasshopper, were to
set off the explosion?  What if Erik was simply intent on destroying
everything, regardless?
At last he spoke: 'The two minutes are up,' he said in a soft, angelic

This annual ball was quite a magnificent affair.  It was given some time
before Shrovetide to celebrate the birthday of a famous illustrator
whose pencil had immortalized, in the style of Gavarni, the extravagant
carnival parade down La Courtille.  As such, the ball was an altogether
merrier, noisier and more Bohemian occasion than was usual for a masked
ball.  Many artists had arranged to meet there; they arrived with an
entourage of models and pupils, who, by midnight, had become quite
boisterous.
Raoul climbed the grand staircase at five minutes to midnight.  He did
not linger to admire the many-coloured costumes on display all the way
up the marble steps of one of the most luxurious settings in the world;
nor did he allow himself to be drawn into the facetious conversation of
masked guests.  He simply ignored all the jesting remarks, and shook off
the attentions of several all too merry couples.
Crossing the big crush-room and escaping from the dancers' farandole
that had encircled him awhile, he at last entered the salon mentioned by
Christine in her letter.  The small room was crammed with people either
on their way to supper at the restaurant in the Rotunda or back from
raising a glass of champagne.
In the midst of the gay and lively hubbub, Raoul thought that, for their
mysterious assignation, Christine must have preferred this crowd to some
lonely corner.
He leaned against a door-jamb and waited.  He did not have to wait long;
a black domino passed him and deftly touched his hand.  He understood
that it was Christine and followed her.
'Is that you, Christine?' he murmured, barely moving his slips.
The black domino promptly looked back and raised her finger to her lips,
no doubt to caution him against uttering her name again.  Raoul followed
on in silence.

  How the storm tore rents
  In heavens gray attired!
  The rags of cloud are flying
  Around, of combat tired.

  And flames of fire lambent,
  Fly between them and part,
  That 's what I call a morning,
  A morning after my heart!

  My heart sees in the heavens
  Its own picture unspoilt--
  It's nothing but the Winter,
  The Winter, cold and wild.

  The hoary frost has a white sheen
  Strewn all over my hair,
  So I thought I was an old man
  And thought life dealt me fair.

  Yet soon was thawed my old white mane,
  And I have my black hair again.
  How I abhor my young fair years,
  How long to wait for death and biers?

  From setting sun to morning's hue
  Many a head turns white.
  Who'll credit it? My hair did not
  In all this lifelong plight!

  In the deepest rocky crevice
  A will-o'-the wisp lured me;
  How I could find my way from here,
  For me it's easy memory!

  For I am used to straying ways,
  Every path to th'end a way,
  All our joys and all our suffering,--
  To a will-o'-the wisp it 's all play!

  Through the dried-up bed of torrents
  I quite calmly downward stroll;
  Every stream its sea will enter,
  Every suffering finds its goal!

take everything they had, which is all right. And spit, most often, on

The fire burned on, the good fathers continued to sprinkle and intone.
Suddenly a flock of pigeons came swooping down from the church and
started to wheel around the roaring column of flame and smoke.  The
crowd shouted, the archers waved their halberds at the birds, Lactance
and Tranquille splashed them on the wing with holy water.  In vain.  The
pigeons were not to be driven away.  Round and round they flew, diving
through the smoke, singeing their feathers in the flames.  Both parties
claimed a miracle.  For the parson's enemies the birds, quite obviously,
were a troop of devils, come to fetch away his soul.  For his friends,
they were emblems of the Holy Ghost and living proof of his innocence.
It never seems to have occurred to anyone that they were just pigeons,
obeying the laws of their own, their blessedly other-than-human nature.

GAME CAT

EXCHANGE MECHANISMS. Sometimes we lose precious
things. Friends and colleagues, fellow travellers in the
Vurt, sometimes we lose them; even lovers we sometimes
lose. And get bad things in exchange: aliens, objects,
snakes, and sometimes even death. Things we don't want.
This is part of the deal, part of the game deal;
all things, in all worlds, must be kept in balance.
Kittlings often ask, who decides on the swappings? Now then,
some say it's all accidental; that some poor Vurt thing
finds himself too close to a door, at too critical a time,
just when something real is being lost. Whoosh! Swap time!
Others say that some kind of overseer is working the
MECHANISMS OF EXCHANGE, deciding the fate of innocents.
The Cat can only tease at this, because of the big secrets
involved, and because of the levels between you, the reader,
and me, the Game Cat. Hey, listen; I've struggled to get
where I am today; why should I give you the easy route?
Get working, kittlings! Reach up higher. Work the Vurt.

  Het Dorp

  Thuis heb ik nog een ansichtkaart
  waarop een kerk, een kar met paard,
  een slagerij J. van der Ven.
  Een kroeg, een juffrouw op de fiets
  het zegt u hoogstwaarschijnlijk niets,
  maar 't is waar ik geboren ben.
  Dit dorp, ik weet nog hoe het was,
  de boerenkind'ren in de klas,
  een kar die ratelt op de keien,
  het raadhuis met een pomp ervoor,
  een zandweg tussen koren door,
  het vee, de boerderijen.

  En langs het tuinpad van m'n vader
  zag ik de hoge bomen staan.
  Ik was een kind en wist niet beter,
  dan dat dat nooit voorbij zou gaan.

  Wat leefden ze eenvoudig toen
  in simp'le huizen tussen groen
  met boerenbloemen en een heg.
  Maar blijkbaar leefden ze verkeerd,
  het dorp is gemoderniseerd
  en nu zijn ze op de goeie weg.
  Want ziet, hoe rijk het leven is,
  ze zien de televisiequiz
  en wonen in betonnen dozen,
  met flink veel glas, dan kun je zien
  hoe of het bankstel staat bij Mien
  en d'r dressoir met plastic rozen.

  En langs het tuinpad van m'n vader
  zag ik de hoge bomen staan.
  Ik was een kind en wist niet beter,
  dan dat dat nooit voorbij zou gaan.

  De dorpsjeugd klit wat bij elkaar
  in minirok en beatle-haar
  en joelt wat mee met beat-muziek.
  Ik weet wel, het is hun goeie recht,
  de nieuwe tijd, net wat u zegt,
  maar het maakt me wat melancholiek.
  Ik heb hun vaders nog gekend
  ze kochten zoethout voor een cent
  ik zag hun moeders touwtjespringen.
  Dat dorp van toen, het is voorbij,
  dit is al wat er bleef voor mij:
  een ansicht en herinneringen.

  Toen ik langs het tuinpad van m'n vader
  de hoge bomen nog zag staan.
  Ik was een kind, hoe kon ik weten
  dat dat voorgoed voorbij zou gaan.

To-day, being in latitude 83° 20', longitude 43° 5' W. (the sea being
of an extraordinarily dark colour), we again saw land from the
masthead, and, upon a closer scrutiny, found it to be one of a group
of very large islands.  The shore was precipitous, and the interior
seemed to be well wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us great
joy.  In about four hours from our first discovering the land we came
to anchor in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast, as a
high surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer
approach of doubtful expediency.  The two largest boats were now
ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whome were Peters and
myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared
to encircle the island.  After searching about for some time, we
discovered an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw four large
canoes put off from the shore, filled with men who seemed to be well
armed.  We waited for them to come up, and, as they moved with great
rapidity, they were soon within hail.  Captain Guy now held up a white
handkerchief on the blade of an oar, when the strangers made a full
stop, and commenced a loud jabbering all at once, intermingled with
occasional shouts, in which we could distinguish the words Anamoo-moo!
and Lama-Lama!  They continued this for at least half an hour, during
which we had a good opportunity of observing their appearance.

'I fled from Basra, sad and tearful, with no idea where I was going,
and I was reciting these lines:

  The pain of parting makes me melt away,
  As lovers do when those they love are harsh.
  I wonder at the patience that I showed
  When I had lost my love, for that was wonderful.
  Beloved, do you know that since you left,
  I have remained confused in misery.

I then heard a voice that said: "Damn you, have you no fear of
Almighty God that you hand over a girl to an unbelieving 'ifrit?"  I
walked for a time amongst the palm-trees until I caught sight of a
person, whom I approached.  When I asked him who he was he said: "I
am one of the jinn who were converted to Islam at the hands of 'Ali
ibn Abi Talib, may God ennoble him."  "How can I get to my wife?" I
asked him, and he said: "Wretched fellow, you had a bird which you
allowed to fly away and now you want to fly after it."  But he
added: "Follow this road with God's blessing all night until dawn
and then by the shore you will see a huge cave in which there is an
idol made of white stone.  You must drink of the water that there is
coming out of the cave and smear your face with its mud.  Stay there
and a barge will pass you as you stand opposite the statue.  Various
different creatures will emerge, heads without bodies and bodies
without heads, and they will prostrate themselves in adoration to
the idol rather than to Almighty God.  When you see that, embark on
the barge and cross to the other bank and walk along it until
sunset.  On a high point you will see a castle built of bricks of
gold and silver.  That is where your 'ifrit will be.  I have now
told you about this, so goodbye."

'On the night of the wedding the ape came to sit in front of me and
asked me what I intended to do.  "Whatever you tell me," I replied,
and he said: "Take care not to covet the girl, or I shall come back
and burn you up and leave you as a lesson for those who can learn."
I agreed to this and when evening came I found the world full of
candles and torches burning in holders of gold and silver.  There
were servants and serving girls, and everyone who saw me
congratulated me on my good fortune, as there was no girl on the
face of the earth more beautiful than my bride.
[...]
'Next morning I went out to the market, and people went in and asked
her how the night had been.  "He never looked up at me," she told
them.  Then, when it was afternoon, I went to my house, where the
ape was sitting by the door.  "Tell me what you did," it said, and I
told it: "By God, I did not learn and do not know whether this was a
man or a girl."  "That's what I want," it said.
[...]
'On the second night my bride was brought to me, after which the
servants left her and went away.  She fell asleep, and, while she
was sleeping, I killed the cock, wrapped it in the cloth and put the
four poles from the couch over it.  Suddenly there was a huge crash
like a peal of thunder and a fiery 'ifrit swooped on the girl.  I
fainted at the sight and when I recovered I heard a voice saying:
"By the Lord of the Ka'ba, the girl has been carried off!" and there
was a sound like the rustling of wind and bitter weeping.  At this I
shed tears, struck my head and was filled with regret when it was no
longer of any use, for to me the whole world was worth no more than
a bean.

O rigorous mathematics, I have not forgotten you since your wise lessons,
sweeter than honey, filtered into my heart like a refreshing wave.
Instinctively, from the cradle, I had longed to drink from your source, older
than the sun, and I continue to tread the sacred sanctuary of your solemn
temple, I, the most faithful of your devotees.  There was a vagueness in my
mind, something thick as smoke; but I managed to mount the steps which lead to
your altar, and you drove away this dark veil, as the wind blows the
draught-board.  You replaced it with excessive coldness, consummate prudence and
implacable logic.  With the aid of your fortifying milk, my intellect developed
rapidly and took on immense proportions amid the ravishing lucidity which you
bestow as a gift on all those who sincerely love you.  Arithmetic!  Algebra!

The urge to discover secrets is deeply ingrained in human nature; even
the least curious mind is roused by the promise of sharing knowledge
withheld from others. Some are fortunate enough to find a job which
consists in the solution of mysteries, whether it be the physicist who
tracks down a hitherto unknown nuclear particle or the policeman who
detects a criminal. But most of us are driven to sublimate this urge
by the solving of artificial puzzles devised for our entertainment.

clouds thickened above them.

"I will tell you this, Long," he continued, "Before you find yourself
you will lose your chi.  Also you will leave behind you all pride of
body, pride of mind.  You will be reduced.  Like me."  The old man
closed his eyes, and rain began to beat against his gray, crew-cut

he looked Long in the face.

"You must leave China.  Go across the ocean.  There you will meet your

down. The soldiers all left to fight the Russians. In the suburbs,
the women and children dug rifle pits. Billy and the rest of his group
were locked up in the stable in the suburbs. And then, one morning,
they got up to discover that the door was unlocked. World War Two in
Europe was over.

Billy and the rest wandered out onto the shady street. The trees were
leafing out. There was nothing going on out there, no traffic of any

Birds were talking.

  I

  A cat is strolling through my mind
  Acting as though he owned the place,
  A lovely cat -- strong, charming, sweet.
  When he meows, one scarcely hears,

  So tender and discreet his tone;
  But whether he should growl or purr
  His voice is always rich and deep.
  That is the secret of his charm.

  This purling voice that filters down
  Into my darkest depths of soul
  Fulfils me like a balanced verse,
  Delights me as a potion would.

  It puts to sleep the cruellest ills
  And keeps a rein on ecstasies --
  Without the need for any words
  It can pronounce the longest phrase.

  Oh no, there is no bow that draws
  Across my heart, fine instrument,
  And makes to sing so royally
  The strongest and the purest chord,

  More than your voice, mysterious cat,
  Exotic cat, seraphic cat,
  In whom all is, angelically,
  As subtle as harmonious.

  II

  From his soft fur, golden and brown,
  Goes out so sweet a scent, one night
  I might have been embalmed in it
  By giving him one little pet.

  He is my household's guardian soul;
  He judges, he presides, inspires
  All matters in hos royal realm;
  Might he be fairy? or a god?

  When my eyes, to this cat I love
  Drawn as by a magnet's force,
  Turn tamely back from that appeal,
  And when I look within myself,

  I notice with astonishment
  The fire of his opal eyes,
  Clear beacons glowing, living jewels,
  Taking my measure, steadily.

There is something in sickness that breaks down the pride of manhood;
that softens the heart and brings it back to the feelings of infancy.
Who that has languished, even in advanced life, in sickness and
despondency — who that has pined on a weary bed in the neglect and
loneliness of a foreign land — but has thought on the mother "that
looked on his childhood," that smoothed his pillow and administered to
his helplessness.  — Oh! there is an enduring tenderness in the love
of a mother to her son that transcends all other affections of the
heart.  It is neither to be chilled by selfishness — nor daunted by
danger — nor weakened by worthlessness — nor stifled by ingratitude.
She will sacrifice every comfort to his convenience — she will
surrender every pleasure to his enjoyment — she will glory in his fame
and exult in his prosperity.  And if misfortune overtake him he will
be the dearer to her from misfortune — and if disgrace settle upon his
name, she will still love and cherish him in spite of his disgrace —
and if all the world beside cast him off, she will be all the world to
him.

E.M. Forster, outdoing the King's heresy with grand bravura, had
written in 1938 that if he were faced with the choice between
betraying his country and betraying his friends, he hoped he would
have the courage to betray his country.  He would always put the
personal above the political.  But for Alan Turing, unlike Forster, or
Wittgenstein, or G.H. Hardy, it was more than a theoretical question.
For him not only had the personal become the political, but the
political was the personal.  He had chosen and promised for himself in
working for the government.  The choice for him therefore was that
between betraying one part of himself and betraying another part.  And
however much he wavered between these alternatives, there was a solid
logic to the mind of security, one that could not be expected to take
an interest in notions of freedom and development.  He had no rights
to such things, as he would have had to admit.  He might have
outwitted the Home Guard, but when it came to questions that mattered,
there was no doubt that he had placed himself under military law.
There was a war on; there was always a war on now.

places we went wrong was the naturalistic Rousseauean movement of the

The operating system is another concept that is curious. Operating
systems are dauntingly complex and totally unnecessary. It’s a brilliant
thing that Bill Gates has done in selling the world on the notion of
operating systems. It’s probably the greatest con game the world has
ever seen.

An operating system does absolutely nothing for you. As long as you had
something — a subroutine called disk driver, a subroutine called some
kind of communication support, in the modern world, it doesn’t do
anything else. In fact, Windows spends a lot of time with overlays and
disk management all stuff like that which are irrelevant. You’ve got
gigabyte disks; you’ve got megabyte RAMs. The world has changed in a way
that renders the operating system unnecessary.

The archive informed the automation. Data structures were built, recipes
followed.  A local network was built, faster than anything on Straum, but surely
safe. Nodes were added, modified by other recipes. The archive was a friendly

would be famous for this.

of internal haemorrhaging and the president of the

I must here declare myself as someone who does not for a moment subscribe to
the general view that a willingness to perform oneself is detrimental to the
dignity of experimental philosophy. There is, after all, a clear distinction
between labour carried out for financial reward, and that done for the
improvement of mankind: to put it another way, Lower as a philosopher was
fully my equal even if he fell away when he became the practising physician.
I think ridiculous of certain professors of anatomy, who find it beneath
them to pick up the knife themselves, but merely comment while hired hands
do the cutting. Sylvius would never have dreamt of sitting on a dais reading
from an authority while others cut — when he taught, the knife was
in his hand and the blood spattered his coat. Boyle also did not scruple to
perform his own experiments and, on one occasion in my presence, even showed
himself willing to anatomise a rat with his very own hands. Nor was he less
a gentleman when he had finished. Indeed, in my opinion, his stature was all
the greater, for in Boyle wealth, humility and curiosity mingled, and the
world is richer for it.

No thought.

The boy extinguished. Only a place.

This place.

Motionless, the Pragma sat facing him, the bare soles of his feet flat against each other, his dark frock scored by the shadows of deep folds, his eyes as empty as the child they watched.

A place without breath or sound. A place of sight alone. A place without before or after . . . almost.

For the first lances of sunlight careered over the glacier, as ponderous as great tree limbs in the wind. Shadows hardened and light gleamed across the Pragma’s ancient skull.

The old man’s left hand forsook his right sleeve, bearing a watery knife. And like a rope in water, his arm pitched outward, fingertips trailing across the blade as the knife swung languidly into the air, the sun skating and the dark shrine plunging across its mirror back . . .

And the place where Kellhus had once existed extended an open hand—the blond hairs like luminous filaments against tanned skin—and grasped the knife from stunned space.

The slap of pommel against palm triggered the collapse of place into little boy. The pale stench of his body. Breath, sound, and lurching thoughts.

I have been legion . . .

In his periphery, he could see the spike of the sun ease from the mountain. He felt drunk with exhaustion. In the recoil of his trance, it seemed all he could hear were the twigs arching and bobbing in the wind, pulled by leaves like a million sails no bigger than his hand. Cause everywhere, but amid countless minute happenings—diffuse, useless.

scientist seemed to be a perfect servant of nothing but truth. At first
glance, one was convinced that nothing but truth could please him as he
beamed at his test tube. At first glance, one thought that he was as
much above the beastly concerns of mankind as the harmoniums in the
caves of Mercury. There, at first glance, was a young man without
vanity, without lust — and one accepted at its face value the title Salo
had engraved on the statue, "Discovery of Atomic Power."

L<Announced on 2012-08-20 by Steve Hay|http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2012/08/msg190775.html>

Preparation:

Cut 16 Perl Onions into quarters and put them in a grill smoker rack
or a perforated pan over a BBQ using hickory wood chips or Special
Blend Smoker Bisquettes.  Smoke them for an hour and remove once they
look golden brown.
Let them cool and put them in the fridge (or freezer) until you are
ready to create the soup.

Ingredients:

  16 diced, pre-smoked, Perl Onions
  3 tbsp butter
  1/4 cup olive oil
  2 small garlic cloves, finely minced
  1 tsp salt
  1 tsp sugar
  black pepper to taste
  1 cup red wine
  1/4 cup all purpose flour
  6 cups of beef or vegetable stock
  1 cup of thick cream (milk can be used as a substitute)

Method:

  Melt the butter in a pan and then add olive oil.
  Heat and add the onions to caramelize over a medium-high heat for up
    to half an hour.
  Add the garlic, turn down the heat and cook for a further 5 minutes.
  Add the salt, pepper and sugar.
  Now add the red wine and reduce to a jam like consistency.
  Add the flour, stir well and add the stock a cup at a time.
  Simmer for 30 minutes, add the cream and heat to almost boiling.

Enjoy.

‘I knew it,’ said Rincewind. ‘We're in a strong magical field.’

Twoflower and Hrun looked around the little hollow where they had made
their noonday halt. Then they looked at each other.

The horses were quietly cropping the rich grass by the stream.  Yellow
butterflies skittered among the bushes.  There was a smell of thyme
and a buzzing of bees. The wild pigs on the spit sizzled gently.

Hrun shrugged and went back to oiling his biceps. They gleamed.

‘Looks alright to me,’ he said.

‘Try tossing a coin,’ said Rincewind.

‘What?’

‘Go on.  Toss a coin.’

‘Hokay,’ said Hrun. 'If that gives you any pleasure.’ He reached into
his pouch and withdrew a handful of loose change plundered from a
dozen realms. With some care he selected a Zchloty leaden
quarter-iotum and balanced it on a purple thumbnail.

‘You call,’ he said. ‘Heads or—’ he inspected the obverse with
an air of intense concentration, ‘some sort of a fish with legs.’

‘When it's in the air,’ said Rincewind.  Hrun grinned and flicked his thumb.

`Yes it is true!  With help from our allies of the Festival, the iron

The new economy is being born; the marginal cost of production has

There was a sharp bang from the roof of the Corn Exchange, right at the

Workers and peasants alike stared in open-mouthed bewilderment at this

Once upon a time Trurl the constructor built an eight-story thinking
machine.  When it was finished, he gave it a coat of white paint,
trimmed the edges in lavender, stepped back, squinted, then added a
little curlicue on the front and, where one might imagine the forehead
to be, a few pale orange polkadots.  Extremely pleased with himself,
he whistled an air and, as is always done on such occasions, asked it
the ritual question of how much is two plus two.

The machine stirred.  Its tubes began to glow, its coils warmed up,
current coursed through all its circuits like a waterfall,
transformers hummed and throbbed, there was a clanging, and a
chugging, and such an ungodly racket that Trurl began to think of
adding a special mentation muffler.  Meanwhile the machine labored on,
as if it had been given the most difficult problem in the Universe to
solve; the ground shook, the sand slid underfoot from the vibration,
valves popped like champagne corks, the relays nearly gave way under
the strain.  At last, when Trurl had grown extremely impatient, the
machine ground to a halt and said in a voice like thunder: SEVEN!

Gibberish of course, but every lad in the country under a certain

older needed a couple of pints inside them to clear away the mind

A fact that must have limited to zero our chances of staying at The

Ged had thought that as the prentice of a great mage he would enter at once
into the mystery and mastery of power. He would understand the language of the
beasts and the speech of the leaves of the forest, he thought, and sway the
winds with his word, and learn to change himself into any shape he
wished. Maybe he and his master would run together as stags, or fly to Re Albi
over the mountain on the wings of eagles.

But it was not so at all. They wandered, first down into the Vale and then
gradually south and westward around the mountain, given lodging in little
villages or spending the night out in the wilderness, like poor
journeyman-sorcerers, or tinkers, or beggars. They entered no mysterious
domain. Nothing happened. The mage's oaken staff that Ged had watched at first
with eager dread was nothing but a stout staff to walk with. Three days went
by and four days went by and still Ogion had not spoken a single charm in
Ged's hearing, and had not taught him a single name or rune or spell.

This day - is a day of the greatest solemnity!  Spain has a king.  He has
been found.  I am that king.  Only this very day did I learn of it.  I
confess, it came to me suddenly in a flash of lightning.  I don't understand
how I could have thought and imagined that I was a titular councillor.  How
could such a wild notion enter my head?  It's a good thing no one thought of
putting me in an insane asylum.  Now everything is laid open before me.  Now
I see everything as on the palm of my hand.  And before, I don't understand,
before everything around me was in some sort of fog.  And all this happens, I
think, because people imagine that the human brain is in the head.  Not at

off, I announced to Mavra who I am.  When she heard that the king of Spain
was standing before her, she clasped her hands and nearly died of fright.

endeavoured to calm her down and assured her in gracious words of my
benevolence and that I was not at all angry that she sometimes polished my
boots poorly.  They're benighted folk.  It's impossible to tell them about
lofty matters.  She got frightened because she's convinced that all kings of
Spain are like Philip II.  But I explained to her that there was no

All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath
the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol
do so at their peril.

It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.
Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the
work is new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the
artist is in accord with himself.

We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as
he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless
thing is that one admires it intensely.

All art is quite useless.

  Strange, to wish wishes no longer.  Strange, to see

  so that finally one feels a little eternity.–
  But the living all make the mistake of too sharp discrimination.

It's not so much that people don't value the programs after they have them--they
do value them.  But they're not the sort of thing that would ever catch on if
they had to overcome the marketing barrier.  (I don't yet know if perl will
catch on at all--I'm worried enough about it that I specifically included an
awk-to-perl translator just to help it catch on.)  Maybe it's all just an
inferiority complex.  Or maybe I don't like to be mercenary.

So I guess I'd say that the reason some software comes free is that the
mechanism for selling it is missing, either from the work environment, or from

already do some other way.  How much money would you personally pay
to upgrade from readnews to rn?  How much money would you pay for

At the start of any project, I'm programming primarily to please
myself. (The two chief virtues in a programmer are laziness and
impatience.)  After a while somebody looks over my shoulder and says,
"That's neat. It'd be neater if it did such-and-so."  So the thing
gets neater. Pretty soon (a year or two) I have an rn, a warp, a patch,
or a perl. One of these years I'll have a metaconfig.

I then say to myself, "I don't want my life's work to die when this
computer is scrapped, so I should let some other people use this.  If I
ask my company to sell this, it'll never see the light of day, and nobody
would pay much for it anyway. If I sell it myself, I'll be in trouble with
my company, to whom I signed my life away when I was hired. If I give it
away, I can pretend it was worthless in the first place, so my company
won't care. In any event, it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission."

So a freely distributable program is born.

by leaf blight, two American towns, complete with central squares,
sidewalks, indoor plumbing, hospitals, manicured lawns, movie theaters,
swimming pools, golf courses, and, of course, Model Ts and As rolling

Back in America, newspapers kept up their drumbeat celebration, only
obliquely referencing reports that things were not progressing as the
company had hoped. But there was one note of skepticism. In late 1928,

But then Australia is such a difficult country to keep track of. On
my first visit, some years ago, I passed the time on the long flight
reading a history of Australian politics in the twentieth century,
wherein I encountered the startling fact that in 1967 the prime minister,
Harold Holt, was strolling along a beach in Victoria when he plunged into
the surf and vanished. No trace of the poor man was ever seen again.
This seemed doubly astounding to me—first that Australia could
just I<lose> a prime minister (I mean, come on) and second that news of
this had never reached me.

  When the full-grown poet came,
  Out spake pleased Nature (the round impassive globe, with all its
      shows of day and night,) saying, He is mine;
  But out spake too the Soul of man, proud, jealous and unreconciled,
      Nay he is mine alone;
  --Then the full-grown poet stood between the two, and took each
      by the hand;
  And to-day and ever so stands, as blender, uniter, tightly
      holding hands,
  Which he will never release until he reconciles the two,
  And wholly and joyously blends them.

In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been
granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I
do not shrink from this responsibility -- I welcome it. I do not believe
that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other
generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this
endeavor will light our country and all who serve it. And the glow from
that fire can truly light the world.

And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you;
ask what you can do for your country.

My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you,
but what together we can do for the freedom of man.

Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,
ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which
we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history
the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love,
asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's
work must truly be our own.

The aliens called the box a "matter generator," but we'd be more inclined
to call it a matter duplicator.  By connecting switches and potentiometers
between the copper posts it was possible to make the box mark off two
cubic rectangular areas of volume.  Make a certain contact, and these
areas would be isolated within perfectly reflective fields.  They could
be expanded or contracted by altering resistances between other posts.
As I worked out the user interface I built a little control panel for
the device.  It was actually a clever way for the aliens to do things;
instead of trying to build controls we could use, they built us an
interface we could attach to controls that made sense to us.  It could
also be automated.

Once you had made the contact that established the shielded volumes,
if you made another certain contact the contents of the first volume
were copied to the second.  The machine copied metal, plastic, steel,
and diamond with equal ease.  Copies of copies of copies of copies were
indistinguishable from the originals at any magnification, even using
techniques like X-ray crystallography.

Candle in hand I stepped in.  I do not know whether the quality of
air, long undisturbed, is peculiar; to me it has always seemed so, and
the damp smell of the old masonry hung in this atmosphere.  My candle
faintly lighted the bare stone wall that enclosed the stair, the foot
of which I could not see.  Down I went, and a few turns brought me to
the stone floor.  Here was another door, of the simple, old, oak kind,
deep sunk in the thickness of the wall.  The large end of the key
fitted this.  The lock was stiff; I set the candle down upon the
stair, and applied both hands; it turned with difficulty, and as it
revolved, uttered a shriek that alarmed me for my secret.

For some minutes I did not move.  In a little time, however, I took
courage, and opened the door.  The night-air floating in puffed out
the candle.  There was a thicket of holly and underwood, as dense as a
jungle, close about the door.  I should have been in pitch-darkness,
were it not that through the topmost leaves there twinkled, here and
there, a glimmer of moonshine.

Softly, lest any one should have opened his window at the sound of the
rusty bolt, I struggled through this till I gained a view of the open
grounds.  Here I found that the brushwood spread a good way up the
park, uniting with the wood that approached the little temple I have
described.

`How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!' thought Alice;
`I might as well be at school at once.' However, she got up, and began to repeat
it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what
she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--

  "'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
  "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
  As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'


`That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the Gryphon.

`Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it sounds uncommon
nonsense.'

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if
anything would ever happen in a natural way again.

`I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.

`She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with the next verse.'

`But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How could he turn them out
with his nose, you know?'

`It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by
the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

Look at Crowley, doing 110 mph on the M40 heading towards
Oxfordshire.  Even the most resolutely casual observer would
notice a number of strange things about him.  The clenched teeth,
for example, or the dull red glow coming from behind his
sunglasses.  And the car.  The car was a definite hint.

Crowley had started the journey in his Bentley, and he was
dammned if he wasn't going to finish it in the Bentley as well.
Not that even the kind of car buff who owns his own pair of
motoring goggles would have been able to tell it was a vintage
Bentley.  Not any more.  They wouldn't have been able to tell
that it was a Bentley.  They would only offer fifty-fifty that it
had ever even been a car.

There was no paint left on it, for a start.  It might still have
been black, where it wasn't a rusty, smudged reddish-brown, but
this was a dull charcoal black.  It traveled in its own ball of
flame, like a space capsule making a particularly difficult
re-entry.

There was a thin skin of crusted, melted rubber left around the
metal wheel rims, but seeing that the wheel rims were still
somhow riding an inch above the road surface this didn't seem to
make an awful lot of difference to the suspension.

It should have fallen apart miles back.

The heat still remained at quite a supportable degree. With an
involuntary shudder, I reflected on what the heat must have been
when the volcano of Sneffels was pouring its smoke, flames, and
streams of boiling lava -- all of which must have come up by the

seething stone darting on, bubbling up with accompaniments of
smoke, steam, and sulphurous stench!

seem to have come into this world without human intervention.

What people take for relentless minimalism is a side effect
of too much exposure to the reactor-cores of fashion. This
has resulted in a remorseless paring-down of what she can and
will wear. She is, literally, allergic to fashion. She can
only tolerate things that could have been worn, to a general
lack of comment, during any year between 1945 and 2000. She's a
design-free zone, a one-woman school of and whose very austerity

Which brings me to the Bokononist concept of a wampeter.  A wampeter is
the pivot of a karass. No karass is without a wampeter, Bokonon tells us,
just as no wheel is without a hub.  Anything can be a wampeter: a tree,
a rock, an animal, an idea, a book, a melody, the Holy Grail. Whatever
it is, the members of its karass revolve about it in the majestic chaos
of a spiral nebula. The orbits of the members of a karass about their
common wampeter are spiritual orbits, naturally. It is souls and not
bodies that revolve. As Bokonon invites us to sing:

  Around and around and around we spin,

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh
dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

"Say -- I'm going in a swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of
course you'd druther work -- wouldn't you? Course you would!"

Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said: "What do you call work?"

"Why ain't that work?"

Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly: "Well, maybe it
is, and maybe it aint. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer."

"Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you like it?"

The brush continued to move. "Like it? Well I don't see why I oughtn't
to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?"

That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom
swept his brush daintily back and forth -- stepped back to note the effect
-- added a touch here and there-criticised the effect again -- Ben
watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
absorbed. Presently he said: "Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little."

The streets were pretty quiet, which was nice. They're always quiet here
at that time: you have to be wearing a black jacket to be out on the
streets between seven and nine in the evening, and not many people in
the area have black jackets. It's just one of those things. I currently
live in Colour Neighbourhood, which is for people who are heavily into
colour.  All the streets and buildings are set for instant colourmatch:
as you walk down the road they change hue to offset whatever you're
wearing.  When the streets are busy it's kind of intense, and anyone

Milo had been caught red-handed in the act of plundering his countrymen,
and, as a result, his stock had never been higher. He proved good as his
word when a rawboned major from Minnesota curled his lip in rebellious
disavowal and demanded his share of the syndicate Milo kept saying
everybody owned. Milo met the challenge by writing the words "A Share"
on the nearest scrap of paper and handing it away with a virtuous disdain
that won the envy and admiration of almost everyone who knew him. His
glory was at a peak, and Colonel Cathcart, who knew and admired his
war record, was astonished by the deferential humility with which Milo
presented himself at Group Headquarters and made his fantastic appeal
for more hazardous assignment.

Whispers of an "evil power" were heard in lines at dairy shops, in
streetcars, stores, arguments, kitchens, suburban and long-distance
trains, at stations large and small, in dachas and on beaches.  Needless
to say, truly mature and cultured people did not tell these stories
about an evil power's visit to the capital. In fact, they even made fun
of them and tried to talk sense into those who told them. Nevertheless,
facts are facts, as they say, and cannot simply be dismissed without
explanation: somebody had visited the capital. The charred cinders of
Griboyedov alone, and many other things besides, confirmed it.  Cultured
people shared the point of view of the investigating team: it was the
work of a gang of hypnotists and ventriloquists magnificently skilled in
their art.

This word flip was weird. Every recording date of McClintic's he'd
gotten into the habit of talking electricity with the audio men and
technicians of the studio. McClintic once couldn't have cared less
about electricity, but now it seemed if that was helping him reach a
bigger audience, some digging, some who would never dig, but all
paying and those royalties keeping the Triumph in gas and McClintic
in J. Press suits, then McClintic ought to be grateful to
electricity, ought maybe to learn a little more about it. So he'd
picked up some here and there, and one day last summer he got around
to talking stochastic music and digital computers with one
technician. Out of the conversation had come Set/Reset, which was
getting to be a signature for the group. He had found out from this
sound man about a two-triode circuit called a flip-flop, which when
it turned on could be one of two ways, depending on which tube was
conducting and which was cut off: set or reset, flip or flop.

"And that," the man said, "can be yes or no, or one or zero. And
that is what you might call one of the basic units, or specialized
`cells' in a big `electronic brain.' "

"Crazy," said McClintic, having lost him back there someplace. But
one thing that did occur to him was if a computer's brain could go
flip or flop, why so could a musician's. As long as you were flop,
everything was cool. But where did the trigger-pulse come from to
make you flip?

Frank and I, unlike the civil servants, were still puzzled that such a
proposal as the Europass could even be seriously under consideration by
the FCO. We can both see clearly that it is wonderful ammunition for the
anti-Europeans. I asked Humphrey if the Foreign Office doesn't realise
how damaging this would be to the European ideal?

'I'm sure they do, Minister, he said. That's why they support it.'

This was even more puzzling, since I'd always been under the impression
that the FO is pro-Europe. 'Is it or isn't it?' I asked Humphrey.

'Yes and no,' he replied of course, 'if you'll pardon the
expression. The Foreign Office is pro-Europe because it is really
anti-Europe. In fact the Civil Service was united in its desire to make
sure the Common Market didn't work. That's why we went into it.'

This sounded like a riddle to me. I asked him to explain further. And
basically his argument was as follows: Britain has had the same foreign
policy objective for at least the last five hundred years - to create a
disunited Europe. In that cause we have fought with the Dutch against
the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and
Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Italians
and Germans. [The Dutch rebellion against Phillip II of Spain, the
Napoleonic Wars, the First World War, and the Second World War - Ed.]

In other words, divide and rule. And the Foreign Office can see no
reason to change when it has worked so well until now.

I was aware of this, naturally, but I regarded it as ancient history.
Humphrey thinks that it is, in fact, current policy. It was necessary
for us to break up the EEC, he explained, so we had to get inside. We
had previously tried to break it up from the outside, but that didn't
work. [A reference to our futile and short-lived involvement in EFTA,
the European Free Trade Association, founded in 1960 and which the UK
left in 1972 - Ed.] Now that we're in, we are able to make a complete
pig's breakfast out of it. We've now set the Germans against the French,
the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch... and
the Foreign office is terribly happy. It's just like old time.

I was staggered by all of this. I thought that the all of us who are
publicly pro-European believed in the European ideal. I said this to Sir
Humphrey, and he simply chuckled.

So I asked him: if we don't believe in the European Ideal, why are we
pushing to increase the membership?

'Same reason,' came the reply. 'It's just like the United Nations. The
more members it has, the more arguments you can stir up, and the more
futile and impotent it becomes.'

This all strikes me as the most appalling cynicism, and I said so.

Sir Humphrey agreed completely. 'Yes Minister. We call it
diplomacy. It's what made Britain great, you know.'

There was silence in the office. I didn't know what we were going to do
about the four hundred new people supervising our economy drive or the
four hundred new people for the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office, or
anything! I simply sat and waited and hoped that my head would stop
thumping and that some idea would be suggested by someone sometime soon.

Sir Humphrey obliged. 'Minister... if we were to end the economy drive
and close the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office we could issue an immediate
press announcement that you had axed eight hundred jobs.' He had
obviously thought this out carefully in advance, for at this moment he
produced a slim folder from under his arm. 'If you'd like to approve
this draft...'

I couldn't believe the impertinence of the suggestion. Axed eight
hundred jobs? 'But no one was ever doing these jobs,' I pointed out
incredulously. 'No one's been appointed yet.'

'Even greater economy,' he replied instantly. 'We've saved eight hundred
redundancy payments as well.'

'But...' I attempted to explain '... that's just phony. It's dishonest,
it's juggling with figures, it's pulling the wool over people's eyes.'

'A government press release, in fact.' said Humphrey.

A jumbo jet touched down, with BURANDAN AIRWAYS written on the side. I
was hugely impressed. British Airways are having to pawn their Concordes,
and here is this little tiny African state with its own airline, jumbo
jets and all.

I asked Bernard how many planes Burandan Airways had. 'None,' he said.

I told him not to be silly and use his eyes. 'No Minister, it belongs to
Freddie Laker,' he said. 'They chartered it last week and repainted it
specially.' Apparently most of the Have-Nots (I mean, LDCs) do this - at
the opening of the UN General Assembly the runways of Kennedy Airport are
jam-packed with phoney flag-carriers. 'In fact,' said Bernard with a sly
grin, 'there was one 747 that belonged to nine different African airlines
in a month. They called it the mumbo-jumbo.'

While we watched nothing much happening on the TV except the mumbo-jumbo
taxiing around Prestwick and the Queen looking a bit chilly, Bernard gave
me the next day's schedule and explained that I was booked on the night
sleeper from King's Cross to Edinburgh because I had to vote in a
three-line whip at the House tonight and would have to miss the last
plane. Then the commentator, in that special hushed BBC voice used for any
occasion with which Royalty is connected, announced reverentially that we
were about to catch our first glimpse of President Selim.

And out of the plane stepped Charlie. My old friend Charlie Umtali. We
were at LSE together. Not Selim Mohammed at all, but Charlie.

Bernard asked me if I were sure. Silly question. How could you forget a
name like Charlie Umtali?

I sent Bernard for Sir Humphrey, who was delighted to hear that we now
know something about our official visitor.

Bernard's official brief said nothing. Amazing! Amazing how little the FCO
has been able to find out. Perhaps they were hoping it would all be on the
car radio. All the brief says is that Colonel Selim Mohammed had converted
to Islam some years ago, they didn't know his original name, and therefore
knew little of his background.

I was able to tell Humphrey and Bernard /all/ about his background.
Charlie was a red-hot political economist, I informed them. Got the top
first. Wiped the floor with everyone.

Bernard seemed relieved. 'Well that's all right then.'

'Why?' I enquired.

'I think Bernard means,' said Sir Humphrey helpfully, 'that he'll know how
to behave if he was at an English University. Even if it was the LSE.' I
never know whether or not Humphrey is insulting me intentionally.

Humphrey was concerned about Charlie's political colour. 'When you said
that he was red-hot, were you speaking politically?'

In a way I was. 'The thing about Charlie is that you never quite know
where you are with him. He's the sort of chap who follows you into a
revolving door and comes out in front.'

'No deeply held convictions?' asked Sir Humphrey.

'No. The only thing Charlie was committed too was Charlie.'

'Ah, I see. A politician, Minister.'

And now this is how things stood: The cat was sitting on one branch. The
bird on another, not too close to the cat. And the wolf walked round and
round the tree, looking at them with greedy eyes.

In the meantime, Peter, without the slightest fear, stood behind the
gate, watching all that was going on. He ran home,got a strong rope and
climbed up the high stone wall.

One of the branches of the tree, around which the wolf was walking,
stretched out over the wall.

Grabbing hold of the branch, Peter lightly climbed over on to the tree.
Peter said to the bird: "Fly down and circle round the wolf's head, only
take care that he doesn't catch you!".

The bird almost touched the wolf's head with its wings, while the wolf
snapped angrily at him from this side and that.

How that bird teased the wolf, how that wolf wanted to catch him! But
the bird was clever and the wolf simply couldn't do anything about it.

L<Announced on 2004-07-19 by Nicholas Clark|http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2004/07/msg93189.html>

Yews are relatively slow growing trees, widely used in landscaping and
ornamental horticulture. They have flat, dark-green needles, reddish
bark, and bear seeds with red arils, which are eaten by thrushes,
waxwings and other birds, dispersing the hard seeds undamaged in their
droppings. Yew wood is reddish brown (with white sapwood), and very
hard. It was traditionally used to make bows, especially the English
longbow.

In England, the Common Yew (Taxus baccata, also known as English Yew) is
often found in churchyards. It is sometimes suggested that these are
placed there as a symbol of long life or trees of death, and some are
likely to be over 3,000 years old. It is also suggested that yew trees
may have a pre-Christian association with old pagan holy sites, and the
Christian church found it expedient to use and take over existing sites.
Another explanation is that the poisonous berries and foliage discourage
farmers and drovers from letting their animals wander into the burial
grounds. The yew tree is a frequent symbol in the Christian poetry of
T.S. Eliot, especially his Four Quartets.

Beeches are trees of the Genus Fagus, family Fagaceae, including about
ten species in Europe, Asia, and North America. The leaves are entire or
sparsely toothed. The fruit is a small, sharply-angled nut, borne in
pairs in spiny husks. The beech most commonly grown as an ornamental or
shade tree is the European beech (Fagus sylvatica).

The southern beeches belong to a different but related genus,
Nothofagus. They are found in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, New
Caledonia and South America.

L<Announced on 2004-07-07 by Nicholas Clark|http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2004/07/msg92840.html>

The Pedunculate Oak is called the Common Oak  in Britain, and is also
often called the English Oak in other English speaking countries It is a
large deciduous tree to 25-35m tall (exceptionally to 40m), with lobed
and sessile (stalk-less) leaves. Flowering takes place in early to mid
spring, and their fruit, called "acorns", ripen by autumn of the same
year. The acorns are pedunculate (having a peduncle or acorn-stalk) and
may occur singly, or several acorns may occur on a stalk.

It forms a long-lived tree, with a large widespreading head of rugged
branches. While it may naturally live to an age of a few centuries, many
of the oldest trees are pollarded or coppiced, both pruning techniques
that extend the tree's potential lifespan, if not its health.

Within its native range it is valued for its importance to insects and
other wildlife. Numerous insects live on the leaves, buds, and in the
acorns. The acorns form a valuable food resource for several small
mammals and some birds, notably Jays Garrulus glandarius.

It is planted for forestry, and produces a long-lasting and durable
heartwood, much in demand for interior and furniture work.

  But when the day's hustle and bustle is done,

  She thinks that the cockroaches just need employment
  To prevent them from idle and wanton destroyment.
  So she's formed, from that a lot of disorderly louts,

  There's a whisper down the line at 11.39
  When the Night Mail's ready to depart,
  Saying 'Skimble where is Skimble has he gone to hunt the thimble?
  We must find him of the train can't start.'
  All the guards and all the porters and the stationmaster's daughters
  They are searching high and low,
  Saying 'Skimble where is Skimble for unless he's very nimble
  Then the Night Mail just can't go'
  At 11.42 then the signal's overdue
  And the passengers are frantic to a man--
  Then Skimble will appear and he'll saunter to the rear:
  He's been busy in the luggage van!
  He gives one flash of his glass-green eyes
  And the signal goes 'All Clear!'
  And we're off at last of the northern part
  Of the Northern Hemisphere!

  We are the music makers,
  And we are the dreamers of dreams,
  Wandering by lonely sea-breakers,
  And sitting by desolate streams; --
  World-losers and world-forsakers,
  On whom the pale moon gleams:
  Yet we are the movers and shakers
  Of the world for ever, it seems.

  There may be trouble ahead,
  But while there's music and moonlight,
  And love and romance,
  Let's face the music and dance.

  Before the fiddlers have fled,
  Before they ask us to pay the bill,
  And while we still have that chance,
  Let's face the music and dance.

  Soon, we'll be without the moon,
  Humming a different tune, and then,

  There may be teardrops to shed,
  So while there's music and moonlight,
  And love and romance,
  Let's face the music and dance.

  Passage, immediate passage! the blood burns in my veins!
  Away O soul! hoist instantly the anchor!
  Cut the hawsers - hall out - shake out every sail!
  Have we not stood here like trees in the ground long enough?
  Have we not grovel'd here long enough, eating and drinking like mere brutes?
  Have we not darken'd and dazed ourselves with books long enough?

  Sail forth - steer for the deep waters only,
  Reckless O soul, exploring, I with the and thou with me,
  For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go,
  And we will risk the ship, ourselves and all.

  O my brave soul!
  O farther farther sail!
  O daring job, but safe! are they not all the seas of God?
  O farther, farther, farther sail!

  They went to sea in a Sieve, they did,
    In a Sieve they went to sea:
  In spite of all their friends could say,
  On a winter's morn, on a stormy day,
    In a Sieve they went to sea!
  And when the Sieve turned round and round,
  And everyone cried, "You'll all be drowned!"
  They cried aloud, "Our Sieve ain't big,
    But we don't care a button, we don't care a fig!
      In a Sieve we'll go to sea!"

  Far and few, far and few,
    Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
  Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
    And they went to sea in a Sieve.

Cohen was familiar with city gates.  He'd broken down a number
in his time, by battering ram, siege gun, and on one occasion
with his head.

But the gates of Hunghung were pretty damn good gates.  They
weren't like the gates of Ankh-Morpork, which were usually wide
open to attract the spending customer and whose concession to
defense was the sign "Thank You For Not Attacking Our City.
Bonum Diem."  These things were big and made of metal and there
was a guardhouse and a squad of unhelpful men in black armor.

There was the faint sound of footsteps.
"Chap with a whip got as far as the big sharp spikes last week,"
said the low priest.
There was a sound like the flushing of a very old dry lavatory.
The footsteps stopped.  The High Priest smiled to himself.
"Right," he said.  "See your two pebbles and raise you two pebbles."
The low priest threw down his cards.  "Double Onion," he said.
The High Priest looked down suspiciously.
The low priest consulted a scrap of paper.  "That's three hundred
thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four pebbles you owe me," he said.
There was the sound of footsteps.  The priests exchanged glances.
"Haven't had one for poisoned-dart alley for quite some time,"
said the High Priest.
"Five says he makes it", said the low priest.  "You're on."
There was a faint clatter of metal points on stone.
"It's a shame to take your pebbles."
There were footsteps again.

"What happens next?" asked Twoflower.

Hrun screwed a finger in his ear and inspected it absently.

"Oh,", he said, "I expect in a minute the door will be
flung back and I'll be dragged off to some sort of temple
arena where I'll fight maybe a couple of giant spiders
and an eight-foot slave from the jungles of Klatch and then
I'll rescue some kind of a princess from the altar and then
I'll kill off a few guards or whatever and then this girl
will show me the secret passage out of the place and we'll
liberate a couple of horses and escape with the treasure."
Hrun leaned his head back on his hands and looked at the
ceiling, whistling tunelessly.

"All that?" said Twoflower.

"Usually."

`What have I got in my pocket?' he said aloud.  He was talking to

upset.

`Not fair! not fair!' he hissed.  `It isn't fair, my precious, is it,
to ask us what it's got in its nassty little pocketses?'

Bilbo seeing what had happened and having nothing better to ask

The monkeys called the place their city, and pretended to despise
the Jungle-People because they lived in the forest. And yet they
never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to use
them. They would sit in circles on the hall of the king's council
chamber, and scratch for fleas and pretend to be men; or they would
run in and out of the roofless houses and collect pieces of plaster
and old bricks in a corner, and forget where they had hidden them,
and fight and cry in scuffling crowds, and then break off to play up
and down the terraces of the king's garden, where they would shake
the rose trees and the oranges in sport to see the fruit and flowers
fall.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked
at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
she fell past it.
