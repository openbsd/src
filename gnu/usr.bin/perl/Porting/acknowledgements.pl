=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perl Porting/acknowledgements.pl v5.15.0..HEAD

a perldelta. You pass in the previous version and it guesses the next
version, fetches information from the repository and outputs the
text.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant

$authors
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not
include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.

please see the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.";
