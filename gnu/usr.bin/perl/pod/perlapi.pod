=head1 NAME

perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains the documentation of the perl public API generated by
embed.pl, specifically a listing of functions, macros, flags, and variables
that may be used by extension writers.  The interfaces of any functions that
are not listed here are subject to change without notice.  For this reason,
blindly using functions listed in proto.h is to be avoided when writing
extensions.

Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the C<PL_>
prefix.  Some macros are provided for compatibility with the older,
unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a future release.

The listing is alphabetical, case insensitive.


=head1 "Gimme" Values

Found in file av.c

=item av_extend

Pre-extend an array.  The C<key> is the index to which the array should be
extended.

	void	av_extend(AV* ar, I32 key)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_fetch

Returns the SV at the specified index in the array.  The C<key> is the
index.  If C<lval> is set then the fetch will be part of a store.  Check
that the return value is non-null before dereferencing it to a C<SV*>.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays.

Stores an SV in an array.  The array index is specified as C<key>.  The
return value will be NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not
need to be actually stored within the array (as in the case of tied
arrays). Otherwise it can be dereferenced to get the original C<SV*>.  Note
that the caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference
count of C<val> before the call, and decrementing it if the function
returned NULL.

=head1 Global Variables

=over 8

=item PL_modglobal

C<PL_modglobal> is a general purpose, interpreter global HV for use by
extensions that need to keep information on a per-interpreter basis.
In a pinch, it can also be used as a symbol table for extensions
to share data among each other.  It is a good idea to use keys
prefixed by the package name of the extension that owns the data.

=head1 GV Functions

=item GvSV

Return the SV from the GV.

	SV*	GvSV(GV* gv)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.h

=item gv_fetchmeth

Returns the glob with the given C<name> and a defined subroutine or
C<NULL>.  The glob lives in the given C<stash>, or in the stashes
accessible via @ISA and UNIVERSAL::.

The argument C<level> should be either 0 or -1.  If C<level==0>, as a
side-effect creates a glob with the given C<name> in the given C<stash>
which in the case of success contains an alias for the subroutine, and sets
up caching info for this glob.  Similarly for all the searched stashes.

This function grants C<"SUPER"> token as a postfix of the stash name. The
GV returned from C<gv_fetchmeth> may be a method cache entry, which is not
visible to Perl code.  So when calling C<call_sv>, you should not use
the GV directly; instead, you should use the method's CV, which can be
obtained from the GV with the C<GvCV> macro.

	GV*	gv_fetchmeth(HV* stash, const char* name, STRLEN len, I32 level)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.c

=item gv_fetchmethod

See L<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>.

	GV*	gv_fetchmethod(HV* stash, const char* name)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.c

=item gv_fetchmethod_autoload

Returns the glob which contains the subroutine to call to invoke the method
on the C<stash>.  In fact in the presence of autoloading this may be the
glob for "AUTOLOAD".  In this case the corresponding variable $AUTOLOAD is
already setup.

The third parameter of C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload> determines whether
AUTOLOAD lookup is performed if the given method is not present: non-zero
means yes, look for AUTOLOAD; zero means no, don't look for AUTOLOAD.
Calling C<gv_fetchmethod> is equivalent to calling C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>
with a non-zero C<autoload> parameter.

These functions grant C<"SUPER"> token as a prefix of the method name. Note
that if you want to keep the returned glob for a long time, you need to
check for it being "AUTOLOAD", since at the later time the call may load a
different subroutine due to $AUTOLOAD changing its value. Use the glob
created via a side effect to do this.

These functions have the same side-effects and as C<gv_fetchmeth> with
C<level==0>.  C<name> should be writable if contains C<':'> or C<'
''>. The warning against passing the GV returned by C<gv_fetchmeth> to
C<call_sv> apply equally to these functions.

	GV*	gv_fetchmethod_autoload(HV* stash, const char* name, I32 autoload)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.c

=item gv_fetchmeth_autoload

Same as gv_fetchmeth(), but looks for autoloaded subroutines too.
Returns a glob for the subroutine.

For an autoloaded subroutine without a GV, will create a GV even
if C<level < 0>.  For an autoloaded subroutine without a stub, GvCV()
of the result may be zero.

	GV*	gv_fetchmeth_autoload(HV* stash, const char* name, STRLEN len, I32 level)

=item gv_stashpv

Returns a pointer to the stash for a specified package.  C<name> should
be a valid UTF-8 string.  If C<create> is set then the package will be
created if it does not already exist.  If C<create> is not set and the
package does not exist then NULL is returned.

	HV*	gv_stashpv(const char* name, I32 create)

Returns the actual pointer stored in the key slot of the hash entry. The
pointer may be either C<char*> or C<SV*>, depending on the value of
C<HeKLEN()>.  Can be assigned to.  The C<HePV()> or C<HeSVKEY()> macros are
usually preferable for finding the value of a key.

	void*	HeKEY(HE* he)

=for hackers
Found in file hv.h

=item HeKLEN

If this is negative, and amounts to C<HEf_SVKEY>, it indicates the entry
holds an C<SV*> key.  Otherwise, holds the actual length of the key.  Can
be assigned to. The C<HePV()> macro is usually preferable for finding key
lengths.

	STRLEN	HeKLEN(HE* he)

=for hackers
Found in file hv.h

=item HePV

Returns the key slot of the hash entry as a C<char*> value, doing any
necessary dereferencing of possibly C<SV*> keys.  The length of the string
is placed in C<len> (this is a macro, so do I<not> use C<&len>).  If you do
not care about what the length of the key is, you may use the global
variable C<PL_na>, though this is rather less efficient than using a local
variable.  Remember though, that hash keys in perl are free to contain
embedded nulls, so using C<strlen()> or similar is not a good way to find
the length of hash keys. This is very similar to the C<SvPV()> macro
described elsewhere in this document.

=item hv_iternext

Returns entries from a hash iterator.  See C<hv_iterinit>.

You may call C<hv_delete> or C<hv_delete_ent> on the hash entry that the
iterator currently points to, without losing your place or invalidating your
iterator.  Note that in this case the current entry is deleted from the hash
with your iterator holding the last reference to it.  Your iterator is flagged
to free the entry on the next call to C<hv_iternext>, so you must not discard
your iterator immediately else the entry will leak - call C<hv_iternext> to
trigger the resource deallocation.

=item hv_iternext_flags

Returns entries from a hash iterator.  See C<hv_iterinit> and C<hv_iternext>.
The C<flags> value will normally be zero; if HV_ITERNEXT_WANTPLACEHOLDERS is
set the placeholders keys (for restricted hashes) will be returned in addition
to normal keys. By default placeholders are automatically skipped over.
Currently a placeholder is implemented with a value that is literally
<&Perl_sv_undef> (a regular C<undef> value is a normal read-write SV for which
C<!SvOK> is false). Note that the implementation of placeholders and
restricted hashes may change, and the implementation currently is
insufficiently abstracted for any change to be tidy.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

=item hv_store

Stores an SV in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C<key> and C<klen> is
the length of the key.  The C<hash> parameter is the precomputed hash
value; if it is zero then Perl will compute it.  The return value will be
NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise it can
be dereferenced to get the original C<SV*>.  Note that the caller is
responsible for suitably incrementing the reference count of C<val> before
the call, and decrementing it if the function returned NULL.

parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then Perl will
compute it.  The return value is the new hash entry so created.  It will be
NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise the
contents of the return value can be accessed using the C<He?> macros
described here.  Note that the caller is responsible for suitably

converts a string representing a binary number to numeric form.

On entry I<start> and I<*len> give the string to scan, I<*flags> gives
conversion flags, and I<result> should be NULL or a pointer to an NV.
The scan stops at the end of the string, or the first invalid character.
On return I<*len> is set to the length scanned string, and I<*flags> gives
output flags.

If the value is <= UV_MAX it is returned as a UV, the output flags are clear,
and nothing is written to I<*result>. If the value is > UV_MAX C<grok_bin>
returns UV_MAX, sets C<PERL_SCAN_GREATER_THAN_UV_MAX> in the output flags,

is NULL).

The hex number may optionally be prefixed with "0b" or "b" unless
C<PERL_SCAN_DISALLOW_PREFIX> is set in I<*flags> on entry. If
C<PERL_SCAN_ALLOW_UNDERSCORES> is set in I<*flags> then the binary

IS_NUMBER_NEG, IS_NUMBER_INFINITY, IS_NUMBER_NAN (defined in perl.h).

If the value of the number can fit an in UV, it is returned in the *valuep
IS_NUMBER_IN_UV will be set to indicate that *valuep is valid, IS_NUMBER_IN_UV

Creates a new SV with its SvPVX pointing to a shared string in the string
table. If the string does not already exist in the table, it is created
first.  Turns on READONLY and FAKE.  The string's hash is stored in the UV
slot of the SV; if the C<hash> parameter is non-zero, that value is used;
otherwise the hash is computed.  The idea here is that as the string table
is used for shared hash keys these strings will have SvPVX == HeKEY and
hash lookup will avoid string compare.

=item sv_usepvn

Tells an SV to use C<ptr> to find its string value.  Normally the string is
stored inside the SV but sv_usepvn allows the SV to use an outside string.
The C<ptr> should point to memory that was allocated by C<malloc>.  The
string length, C<len>, must be supplied.  This function will realloc the
memory pointed to by C<ptr>, so that pointer should not be freed or used by
the programmer after giving it to sv_usepvn.  Does not handle 'set' magic.

Converts a string C<s> of length C<len> from UTF8 into byte encoding.
Unlike <utf8_to_bytes> but like C<bytes_to_utf8>, returns a pointer to
the newly-created string, and updates C<len> to contain the new
length.  Returns the original string if no conversion occurs, C<len>
is unchanged. Do nothing if C<is_utf8> points to 0. Sets C<is_utf8> to
0 if C<s> is converted or contains all 7bit characters.

=item ibcmp_utf8

Return true if the strings s1 and s2 differ case-insensitively, false
if not (if they are equal case-insensitively).  If u1 is true, the
string s1 is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  If u2 is true,
the string s2 is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  If u1 or u2
are false, the respective string is assumed to be in native 8-bit
encoding.

If the pe1 and pe2 are non-NULL, the scanning pointers will be copied
in there (they will point at the beginning of the I<next> character).
If the pointers behind pe1 or pe2 are non-NULL, they are the end
pointers beyond which scanning will not continue under any
circustances.  If the byte lengths l1 and l2 are non-zero, s1+l1 and
s2+l2 will be used as goal end pointers that will also stop the scan,
and which qualify towards defining a successful match: all the scans
that define an explicit length must reach their goal pointers for
a match to succeed).

For case-insensitiveness, the "casefolding" of Unicode is used
instead of upper/lowercasing both the characters, see
http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/ (Case Mappings).

The "p" contains the pointer to the UTF-8 string encoding

of the result.

The "swashp" is a pointer to the swash to use.

Both the special and normal mappings are stored lib/unicore/To/Foo.pl,
and loaded by SWASHGET, using lib/utf8_heavy.pl.  The special (usually,
but not always, a multicharacter mapping), is tried first.

The "special" is a string like "utf8::ToSpecLower", which means the
hash %utf8::ToSpecLower.  The access to the hash is through
Perl_to_utf8_case().

The "normal" is a string like "ToLower" which means the swash
%utf8::ToLower.

Returns the unicode code point value of the first character in the string C<s>
which is assumed to be in UTF8 encoding and no longer than C<curlen>;
C<retlen> will be set to the length, in bytes, of that character.

If C<s> does not point to a well-formed UTF8 character, the behaviour
is dependent on the value of C<flags>: if it contains UTF8_CHECK_ONLY,
it is assumed that the caller will raise a warning, and this function
will silently just set C<retlen> to C<-1> and return zero.  If the
C<flags> does not contain UTF8_CHECK_ONLY, warnings about
malformations will be given, C<retlen> will be set to the expected
length of the UTF-8 character in bytes, and zero will be returned.

The C<flags> can also contain various flags to allow deviations from
the strict UTF-8 encoding (see F<utf8.h>).
