=head1 Security

=head2 [CVE-2017-12837] Heap buffer overflow in regular expression compiler

Compiling certain regular expression patterns with the case-insensitive
modifier could cause a heap buffer overflow and crash perl.  This has now been
fixed.
L<[perl #131582]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131582>

=head2 [CVE-2017-12883] Buffer over-read in regular expression parser

For certain types of syntax error in a regular expression pattern, the error
message could either contain the contents of a random, possibly large, chunk of
memory, or could crash perl.  This has now been fixed.
L<[perl #131598]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131598>

=head2 [CVE-2017-12814] C<$ENV{$key}> stack buffer overflow on Windows

A possible stack buffer overflow in the C<%ENV> code on Windows has been fixed
by removing the buffer completely since it was superfluous anyway.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.26.0.  If any exist,

Bugs> below.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<base> has been upgraded from version 2.25 to 2.26.

The effects of dotless C<@INC> on this module have been limited by the
introduction of a more refined and accurate solution for removing C<'.'> from
C<@INC> while reducing the false positives.

=item *

L<charnames> has been upgraded from version 1.44 to 1.45.

=item *

L<Module::CoreList> has been upgraded from version 5.20170530 to 5.20170922_26.

=item *

Building with B<g++> on FreeBSD-11.0 has been fixed.
L<[perl #131337]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131337>

=item Windows

=over 4

=item *

Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
(containing Visual C++ 14.1) has been added.

=item *

Building XS modules with GCC 6 in a 64-bit build of Perl failed due to
incorrect mapping of C<strtoll> and C<strtoull>.  This has now been fixed.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Several built-in functions previously had bugs that could cause them to write
to the internal stack without allocating room for the item being written.  In
rare situations, this could have led to a crash.  These bugs have now been
fixed, and if any similar bugs are introduced in future, they will be detected
automatically in debugging builds.
L<[perl #131732]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131732>

=item *

Using a symbolic ref with postderef syntax as the key in a hash lookup was
yielding an assertion failure on debugging builds.
L<[perl #131627]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131627>

=item *

List assignment (C<aassign>) could in some rare cases allocate an entry on the
mortal stack and leave the entry uninitialized.
L<[perl #131570]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131570>

=item *

Attempting to apply an attribute to an C<our> variable where a function of that
name already exists could result in a NULL pointer being supplied where an SV
was expected, crashing perl.
L<[perl #131597]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131597>

=item *

The code that vivifies a typeglob out of a code ref made some false assumptions
that could lead to a crash in cases such as C<< $::{"A"} = sub {}; \&{"A"} >>.
This has now been fixed.
L<[perl #131085]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131085>

=item *

C<my_atof2> no longer reads beyond the terminating NUL, which previously
occurred if the decimal point is immediately before the NUL.
L<[perl #131526]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131526>

=item *

Occasional "Malformed UTF-8 character" crashes in C<s//> on utf8 strings have
been fixed.
L<[perl #131575]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131575>

=item *

C<perldoc -f s> now finds C<s///>.
L<[perl #131371]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131371>

=item *

Some erroneous warnings after utf8 conversion have been fixed.
L<[perl #131190]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131190>

=item *

The C<jmpenv> frame to catch Perl exceptions is set up lazily, and this used to
be a bit too lazy.  The catcher is now set up earlier, preventing some possible
crashes.
L<[perl #105930]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=105930>

=item *

Spurious "Assuming NOT a POSIX class" warnings have been removed.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION> for details of how to
report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you
can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
