=head1 NAME

perlexperiment - A listing of experimental features in Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document lists the current and past experimental features in the perl
core. Although all of these are documented with their appropriate topics,
this succinct listing gives you an overview and basic facts about their
status.

So far we've merely tried to find and list the experimental features and infer
their inception, versions, etc. There's a lot of speculation here.

=head2 Accepted features

These features were so wildly successful and played so well with others that
we decided to remove their experimental status and admit them as full, stable
features in the world of Perl, lavishing all the benefits and luxuries thereof.
They are also awarded +5 Stability and +3 Charisma.
