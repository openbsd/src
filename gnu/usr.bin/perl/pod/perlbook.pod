=head1 NAME

perlbook - Books about and related to Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are many books on Perl and Perl-related. A few of these are
good, some are OK, but many aren't worth your money. There is a list
of these books, some with extensive reviews, at http://books.perl.org/
. We list some of the books here, and while listing a book implies our
endorsement, don't think that not including a book means anything.

Most of these books are available online through Safari Books Online
( http://safaribooksonline.com/ ).

=head2 Other interesting, non-Perl books

You might notice several familiar Perl concepts in this collection of
ACM columns from Jon Bentley. The similarity to the title of the major
Perl book (which came later) is not completely accidental:

=head2 A note on freshness

Each version of Perl comes with the documentation that was current at
the time of release. This poses a problem for content such as book
lists. There are probably very nice books published after this list
was included in your Perl release, and you can check the latest
released version at http://perldoc.perl.org/perlbook.html .

Some of the books we've listed appear almost ancient in internet
scale, but we've included those books because they still describe the
current way of doing things. Not everything in Perl changes every day.
Many of the beginner-level books, too, go over basic features and
techniques that are still valid today. In general though, we try to
limit this list to books published in the past five years.

=head2 Get your book listed

If your Perl book isn't listed and you think it should be, let us know.
