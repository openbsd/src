/* Note on debug output:
 *
 * This is set up so that -Dr turns on debugging like all other flags that are
 * enabled by -DDEBUGGING.  -Drv gives more verbose output.  This applies to
 * all regular expressions encountered in a program, and gives a huge amount of
 * output for all but the shortest programs.
 *
 * The ability to output pattern debugging information lexically, and with much
 * finer grained control was added, with 'use re qw(Debug ....);' available even
 * in non-DEBUGGING builds.  This is accomplished by copying the contents of
 * regcomp.c to ext/re/re_comp.c, and regexec.c is copied to ext/re/re_exec.c.
 * Those files are compiled and linked into the perl executable, and they are
 * compiled essentially as if DEBUGGING were enabled, and controlled by calls
 * to re.pm.
 *
 * That would normally mean linking errors when two functions of the same name
 * are attempted to be placed into the same executable.  That is solved in one
 * of four ways:
 *  1)  Static functions aren't known outside the file they are in, so for the
 *      many functions of that type in this file, it just isn't a problem.
 *  2)  Most externally known functions are enclosed in
 *          #ifndef PERL_IN_XSUB_RE
 *          ...
 *          #endif
 *      blocks, so there is only one defintion for them in the whole
 *      executable, the one in regcomp.c (or regexec.c).  The implication of
 *      that is any debugging info that comes from them is controlled only by
 *      -Dr.  Further, any static function they call will also be the version
 *      in regcomp.c (or regexec.c), so its debugging will also be by -Dr.
 *  3)  About a dozen external functions are re-#defined in ext/re/re_top.h, to
 *      have different names, so that what gets loaded in the executable is
 *      'Perl_foo' from regcomp.c (and regexec.c), and the identical function
 *      from re_comp.c (and re_exec.c), but with the name 'my_foo'  Debugging
 *      in the 'Perl_foo' versions is controlled by -Dr, but the 'my_foo'
 *      versions and their callees are under control of re.pm.   The catch is
 *      that references to all these go through the regexp_engine structure,
 *      which is initialized in regcomp.h to the Perl_foo versions, and
 *      substituted out in lexical scopes where 'use re' is in effect to the
 *      'my_foo' ones.   That structure is public API, so it would be a hard
 *      sell to add any additional members.
 *  4)  For functions in regcomp.c and re_comp.c that are called only from,
 *      respectively, regexec.c and re_exec.c, they can have two different
 *      names, depending on #ifdef'ing PERL_IN_XSUB_RE, in both regexec.c and
 *      embed.fnc.
 *
 * The bottom line is that if you add code to one of the public functions
 * listed in ext/re/re_top.h, debugging automagically works.  But if you write
 * a new function that needs to do debugging or there is a chain of calls from
 * it that need to do debugging, all functions in the chain should use options
 * 2) or 4) above.
 *
 * A function may have to be split so that debugging stuff is static, but it
 * calls out to some other function that only gets compiled in regcomp.c to
 * access data that we don't want to duplicate.

/* About scan_data_t.

  During optimisation we recurse through the regexp program performing
  various inplace (keyhole style) optimisations. In addition study_chunk
  and scan_commit populate this data structure with information about
  what strings MUST appear in the pattern. We look for the longest
  string that must appear at a fixed location, and we look for the
  longest string that may appear at a floating location. So for instance
  in the pattern:

    /FOO[xX]A.*B[xX]BAR/

  Both 'FOO' and 'A' are fixed strings. Both 'B' and 'BAR' are floating
  strings (because they follow a .* construct). study_chunk will identify
  both FOO and BAR as being the longest fixed and floating strings respectively.

  The strings can be composites, for instance

     /(f)(o)(o)/

  will result in a composite fixed substring 'foo'.

  For each string some basic information is maintained:

  - min_offset
    This is the position the string must appear at, or not before.
    It also implicitly (when combined with minlenp) tells us how many
    characters must match before the string we are searching for.
    Likewise when combined with minlenp and the length of the string it
    tells us how many characters must appear after the string we have
    found.

  - max_offset
    Only used for floating strings. This is the rightmost point that
    the string can appear at. If set to OPTIMIZE_INFTY it indicates that the
    string can occur infinitely far to the right.
    For fixed strings, it is equal to min_offset.

  - minlenp
    A pointer to the minimum number of characters of the pattern that the
    string was found inside. This is important as in the case of positive
    lookahead or positive lookbehind we can have multiple patterns
    involved. Consider

    /(?=FOO).*F/

    The minimum length of the pattern overall is 3, the minimum length
    of the lookahead part is 3, but the minimum length of the part that
    will actually match is 1. So 'FOO's minimum length is 3, but the
    minimum length for the F is 1. This is important as the minimum length
    is used to determine offsets in front of and behind the string being
    looked for.  Since strings can be composites this is the length of the
    pattern at the time it was committed with a scan_commit. Note that
    the length is calculated by study_chunk, so that the minimum lengths
    are not known until the full pattern has been compiled, thus the
    pointer to the value.

  - lookbehind

    In the case of lookbehind the string being searched for can be
    offset past the start point of the final matching string.
    If this value was just blithely removed from the min_offset it would
    invalidate some of the calculations for how many chars must match
    before or after (as they are derived from min_offset and minlen and
    the length of the string being searched for).
    When the final pattern is compiled and the data is moved from the
    scan_data_t structure into the regexp structure the information
    about lookbehind is factored in, with the information that would
    have been lost precalculated in the end_shift field for the
    associated string.

  The fields pos_min and pos_delta are used to store the minimum offset
  and the delta to the maximum offset at the current point in the pattern.

/* The code in this file in places uses one level of recursion with parsing
 * rebased to an alternate string constructed by us in memory.  This can take
 * the form of something that is completely different from the input, or
 * something that uses the input as part of the alternate.  In the first case,
 * there should be no possibility of an error, as we are in complete control of
 * the alternate string.  But in the second case we don't completely control
 * the input portion, so there may be errors in that.  Here's an example:
 *      /[abc\x{DF}def]/ui
 * is handled specially because \x{df} folds to a sequence of more than one
 * character: 'ss'.  What is done is to create and parse an alternate string,
 * which looks like this:
 *      /(?:\x{DF}|[abc\x{DF}def])/ui
 * where it uses the input unchanged in the middle of something it constructs,
 * which is a branch for the DF outside the character class, and clustering
 * parens around the whole thing. (It knows enough to skip the DF inside the
 * class while in this substitute parse.) 'abc' and 'def' may have errors that
 * need to be reported.  The general situation looks like this:
 *
 *                                       |<------- identical ------>|
 *              sI                       tI               xI       eI
 * Input:       ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Constructed:         ---------------------------------------------------
 *                      sC               tC               xC       eC     EC
 *                                       |<------- identical ------>|
 *
 * sI..eI   is the portion of the input pattern we are concerned with here.
 * sC..EC   is the constructed substitute parse string.
 *  sC..tC  is constructed by us
 *  tC..eC  is an exact duplicate of the portion of the input pattern tI..eI.
 *          In the diagram, these are vertically aligned.
 *  eC..EC  is also constructed by us.
 * xC       is the position in the substitute parse string where we found a
 *          problem.
 * xI       is the position in the original pattern corresponding to xC.
 *
 * We want to display a message showing the real input string.  Thus we need to
 * translate from xC to xI.  We know that xC >= tC, since the portion of the
 * string sC..tC has been constructed by us, and so shouldn't have errors.  We
 * get:
 *      xI = tI + (xC - tC)
 *
 * When the substitute parse is constructed, the code needs to set:
 *      RExC_start (sC)
 *      RExC_end (eC)
 *      RExC_copy_start_in_input  (tI)
 *      RExC_copy_start_in_constructed (tC)
 * and restore them when done.
 *
 * During normal processing of the input pattern, both
 * 'RExC_copy_start_in_input' and 'RExC_copy_start_in_constructed' are set to
 * sI, so that xC equals xI.

/* make_trie(startbranch,first,last,tail,word_count,flags,depth)

  first      : start branch of sequence of branch-exact nodes.
               May be the same as startbranch
  last       : Thing following the last branch.

  depth      : indent depth

Inplace optimizes a sequence of 2 or more Branch-Exact nodes into a TRIE node.

A trie is an N'ary tree where the branches are determined by digital
decomposition of the key. IE, at the root node you look up the 1st character and
follow that branch repeat until you find the end of the branches. Nodes can be
marked as "accepting" meaning they represent a complete word. Eg:

  /he|she|his|hers/

would convert into the following structure. Numbers represent states, letters
following numbers represent valid transitions on the letter from that state, if
the number is in square brackets it represents an accepting state, otherwise it
will be in parenthesis.

      +-h->+-e->[3]-+-r->(8)-+-s->[9]
      |    |
      |   (2)
      |    |
     (1)   +-i->(6)-+-s->[7]
      |
      +-s->(3)-+-h->(4)-+-e->[5]

      Accept Word Mapping: 3=>1 (he),5=>2 (she), 7=>3 (his), 9=>4 (hers)

This shows that when matching against the string 'hers' we will begin at state 1
read 'h' and move to state 2, read 'e' and move to state 3 which is accepting,
then read 'r' and go to state 8 followed by 's' which takes us to state 9 which
is also accepting. Thus we know that we can match both 'he' and 'hers' with a
single traverse. We store a mapping from accepting to state to which word was
matched, and then when we have multiple possibilities we try to complete the
rest of the regex in the order in which they occurred in the alternation.

The only prior NFA like behaviour that would be changed by the TRIE support is
the silent ignoring of duplicate alternations which are of the form:

 / (DUPE|DUPE) X? (?{ ... }) Y /x

Thus EVAL blocks following a trie may be called a different number of times with
and without the optimisation. With the optimisations dupes will be silently
ignored. This inconsistent behaviour of EVAL type nodes is well established as
the following demonstrates:

 'words'=~/(word|word|word)(?{ print $1 })[xyz]/

which prints out 'word' three times, but

 'words'=~/(word|word|word)(?{ print $1 })S/

which doesnt print it out at all. This is due to other optimisations kicking in.

Example of what happens on a structural level:

The regexp /(ac|ad|ab)+/ will produce the following debug output:

   1: CURLYM[1] {1,32767}(18)
   5:   BRANCH(8)
   6:     EXACT <ac>(16)
   8:   BRANCH(11)
   9:     EXACT <ad>(16)
  11:   BRANCH(14)
  12:     EXACT <ab>(16)
  16:   SUCCEED(0)
  17:   NOTHING(18)
  18: END(0)

This would be optimizable with startbranch=5, first=5, last=16, tail=16
and should turn into:

   1: CURLYM[1] {1,32767}(18)
   5:   TRIE(16)
        [Words:3 Chars Stored:6 Unique Chars:4 States:5 NCP:1]
          <ac>
          <ad>
          <ab>
  16:   SUCCEED(0)
  17:   NOTHING(18)
  18: END(0)

Cases where tail != last would be like /(?foo|bar)baz/:

   1: BRANCH(4)
   2:   EXACT <foo>(8)
   4: BRANCH(7)
   5:   EXACT <bar>(8)
   7: TAIL(8)
   8: EXACT <baz>(10)
  10: END(0)

which would be optimizable with startbranch=1, first=1, last=7, tail=8
and would end up looking like:

    1: TRIE(8)
      [Words:2 Chars Stored:6 Unique Chars:5 States:7 NCP:1]
        <foo>
        <bar>
   7: TAIL(8)
   8: EXACT <baz>(10)
  10: END(0)

    d = uvchr_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, 0);

       We first traverse the branches and scan each word to determine if it
       contains widechars, and how many unique chars there are, this is
       important as we have to build a table with at least as many columns as we
       have unique chars.

       We use an array of integers to represent the character codes 0..255
       (trie->charmap) and we use a an HV* to store Unicode characters. We use
       the native representation of the character value as the key and IV's for
       the coded index.

       *TODO* If we keep track of how many times each character is used we can
       remap the columns so that the table compression later on is more
       efficient in terms of memory by ensuring the most common value is in the
       middle and the least common are on the outside.  IMO this would be better
       than a most to least common mapping as theres a decent chance the most
       common letter will share a node with the least common, meaning the node
       will not be compressible. With a middle is most common approach the worst
       case is when we have the least common nodes twice.

           We use the .check field of the first entry of the node temporarily
           to make compression both faster and easier by keeping track of how
           many non zero fields are in the node.

           Since trans are numbered from 1 any 0 pointer in the table is a FAIL
           transition.

           There are two terms at use here: state as a TRIE_NODEIDX() which is
           a number representing the first entry of the node, and state as a
           TRIE_NODENUM() which is the trans number. state 1 is TRIE_NODEIDX(1)
           and TRIE_NODENUM(1), state 2 is TRIE_NODEIDX(2) and TRIE_NODENUM(3)
           if there are 2 entrys per node. eg:

             A B       A B
          1. 2 4    1. 3 7
          2. 0 3    3. 0 5
          3. 0 0    5. 0 0
          4. 0 0    7. 0 0

           The table is internally in the right hand, idx form. However as we
           also have to deal with the states array which is indexed by nodenum
           we have to use TRIE_NODENUM() to convert.

           For sparse data sets the table constructed by the trie algorithm will
           be mostly 0/FAIL transitions or to put it another way mostly empty.
           (Note that leaf nodes will not contain any transitions.)

           This algorithm compresses the tables by eliminating most such
           transitions, at the cost of a modest bit of extra work during lookup:

           - Each states[] entry contains a .base field which indicates the
           index in the state[] array wheres its transition data is stored.

           - If .base is 0 there are no valid transitions from that node.

           - If .base is nonzero then charid is added to it to find an entry in
           the trans array.

           -If trans[states[state].base+charid].check!=state then the
           transition is taken to be a 0/Fail transition. Thus if there are fail
           transitions at the front of the node then the .base offset will point
           somewhere inside the previous nodes data (or maybe even into a node
           even earlier), but the .check field determines if the transition is
           valid.

           XXX - wrong maybe?
           The following process inplace converts the table to the compressed
           table: We first do not compress the root node 1,and mark all its
           .check pointers as 1 and set its .base pointer as 1 as well. This
           allows us to do a DFA construction from the compressed table later,
           and ensures that any .base pointers we calculate later are greater
           than 0.

           - We set 'pos' to indicate the first entry of the second node.

           - We then iterate over the columns of the node, finding the first and
           last used entry at l and m. We then copy l..m into pos..(pos+m-l),
           and set the .check pointers accordingly, and advance pos
           appropriately and repreat for the next node. Note that when we copy
           the next pointers we have to convert them from the original
           NODEIDX form to NODENUM form as the former is not valid post
           compression.

           - If a node has no transitions used we mark its base as 0 and do not
           advance the pos pointer.

           - If a node only has one transition we use a second pointer into the
           structure to fill in allocated fail transitions from other states.
           This pointer is independent of the main pointer and scans forward
           looking for null transitions that are allocated to a state. When it
           finds one it writes the single transition into the "hole".  If the
           pointer doesnt find one the single transition is appended as normal.

           - Once compressed we can Renew/realloc the structures to release the
           excess space.

           See "Table-Compression Methods" in sec 3.9 of the Red Dragon,
           specifically Fig 3.47 and the associated pseudocode.

   This is basically the Aho-Corasick algorithm. Its from exercise 3.31 and

   We find the fail state for each state in the trie, this state is the longest
   proper suffix of the current state's 'word' that is also a proper prefix of
   another word in our trie. State 1 represents the word '' and is thus the
   default fail state. This allows the DFA not to have to restart after its
   tried and failed a word at a given point, it simply continues as though it
   had been matching the other word in the first place.
   Consider
      'abcdgu'=~/abcdefg|cdgu/
   When we get to 'd' we are still matching the first word, we would encounter
   'g' which would fail, which would bring us to the state representing 'd' in
   the second word where we would try 'g' and succeed, proceeding to match
   'cdgu'.

/* The below joins as many adjacent EXACTish nodes as possible into a single

 * require special handling.  The joining is only done if:
 * 1) there is room in the current conglomerated node to entirely contain the
 *    next one.
 * 2) they are compatible node types
 *
 * The adjacent nodes actually may be separated by NOTHING-kind nodes, and
 * these get optimized out
 *
 * XXX khw thinks this should be enhanced to fill EXACT (at least) nodes as full
 * as possible, even if that means splitting an existing node so that its first
 * part is moved to the preceding node.  This would maximise the efficiency of
 * memEQ during matching.
 *
 * If a node is to match under /i (folded), the number of characters it matches
 * can be different than its character length if it contains a multi-character
 * fold.  *min_subtract is set to the total delta number of characters of the
 * input nodes.
 *
 * And *unfolded_multi_char is set to indicate whether or not the node contains
 * an unfolded multi-char fold.  This happens when it won't be known until
 * runtime whether the fold is valid or not; namely
 *  1) for EXACTF nodes that contain LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S, as only if the
 *      target string being matched against turns out to be UTF-8 is that fold
 *      valid; or
 *  2) for EXACTFL nodes whose folding rules depend on the locale in force at
 *      runtime.
 * (Multi-char folds whose components are all above the Latin1 range are not
 * run-time locale dependent, and have already been folded by the time this
 * function is called.)
 *
 * This is as good a place as any to discuss the design of handling these
 * multi-character fold sequences.  It's been wrong in Perl for a very long
 * time.  There are three code points in Unicode whose multi-character folds
 * were long ago discovered to mess things up.  The previous designs for
 * dealing with these involved assigning a special node for them.  This
 * approach doesn't always work, as evidenced by this example:
 *      "\xDFs" =~ /s\xDF/ui    # Used to fail before these patches
 * Both sides fold to "sss", but if the pattern is parsed to create a node that
 * would match just the \xDF, it won't be able to handle the case where a
 * successful match would have to cross the node's boundary.  The new approach
 * that hopefully generally solves the problem generates an EXACTFUP node
 * that is "sss" in this case.
 *
 * It turns out that there are problems with all multi-character folds, and not
 * just these three.  Now the code is general, for all such cases.  The
 * approach taken is:
 * 1)   This routine examines each EXACTFish node that could contain multi-
 *      character folded sequences.  Since a single character can fold into
 *      such a sequence, the minimum match length for this node is less than
 *      the number of characters in the node.  This routine returns in
 *      *min_subtract how many characters to subtract from the actual
 *      length of the string to get a real minimum match length; it is 0 if
 *      there are no multi-char foldeds.  This delta is used by the caller to
 *      adjust the min length of the match, and the delta between min and max,
 *      so that the optimizer doesn't reject these possibilities based on size
 *      constraints.
 *
 * 2)   For the sequence involving the LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF)
 *      under /u, we fold it to 'ss' in regatom(), and in this routine, after
 *      joining, we scan for occurrences of the sequence 'ss' in non-UTF-8
 *      EXACTFU nodes.  The node type of such nodes is then changed to
 *      EXACTFUP, indicating it is problematic, and needs careful handling.
 *      (The procedures in step 1) above are sufficient to handle this case in
 *      UTF-8 encoded nodes.)  The reason this is problematic is that this is
 *      the only case where there is a possible fold length change in non-UTF-8
 *      patterns.  By reserving a special node type for problematic cases, the
 *      far more common regular EXACTFU nodes can be processed faster.
 *      regexec.c takes advantage of this.
 *
 *      EXACTFUP has been created as a grab-bag for (hopefully uncommon)
 *      problematic cases.   These all only occur when the pattern is not
 *      UTF-8.  In addition to the 'ss' sequence where there is a possible fold
 *      length change, it handles the situation where the string cannot be
 *      entirely folded.  The strings in an EXACTFish node are folded as much
 *      as possible during compilation in regcomp.c.  This saves effort in
 *      regex matching.  By using an EXACTFUP node when it is not possible to
 *      fully fold at compile time, regexec.c can know that everything in an
 *      EXACTFU node is folded, so folding can be skipped at runtime.  The only
 *      case where folding in EXACTFU nodes can't be done at compile time is
 *      the presumably uncommon MICRO SIGN, when the pattern isn't UTF-8.  This
 *      is because its fold requires UTF-8 to represent.  Thus EXACTFUP nodes
 *      handle two very different cases.  Alternatively, there could have been
 *      a node type where there are length changes, one for unfolded, and one
 *      for both.  If yet another special case needed to be created, the number
 *      of required node types would have to go to 7.  khw figures that even
 *      though there are plenty of node types to spare, that the maintenance
 *      cost wasn't worth the small speedup of doing it that way, especially
 *      since he thinks the MICRO SIGN is rarely encountered in practice.
 *
 *      There are other cases where folding isn't done at compile time, but
 *      none of them are under /u, and hence not for EXACTFU nodes.  The folds
 *      in EXACTFL nodes aren't known until runtime, and vary as the locale
 *      changes.  Some folds in EXACTF depend on if the runtime target string
 *      is UTF-8 or not.  (regatom() will create an EXACTFU node even under /di
 *      when no fold in it depends on the UTF-8ness of the target string.)
 *
 * 3)   A problem remains for unfolded multi-char folds. (These occur when the
 *      validity of the fold won't be known until runtime, and so must remain
 *      unfolded for now.  This happens for the sharp s in EXACTF and EXACTFAA
 *      nodes when the pattern isn't in UTF-8.  (Note, BTW, that there cannot
 *      be an EXACTF node with a UTF-8 pattern.)  They also occur for various
 *      folds in EXACTFL nodes, regardless of the UTF-ness of the pattern.)
 *      The reason this is a problem is that the optimizer part of regexec.c
 *      (probably unwittingly, in Perl_regexec_flags()) makes an assumption
 *      that a character in the pattern corresponds to at most a single
 *      character in the target string.  (And I do mean character, and not byte
 *      here, unlike other parts of the documentation that have never been
 *      updated to account for multibyte Unicode.)  Sharp s in EXACTF and
 *      EXACTFL nodes can match the two character string 'ss'; in EXACTFAA
 *      nodes it can match "\x{17F}\x{17F}".  These, along with other ones in
 *      EXACTFL nodes, violate the assumption, and they are the only instances
 *      where it is violated.  I'm reluctant to try to change the assumption,
 *      as the code involved is impenetrable to me (khw), so instead the code
 *      here punts.  This routine examines EXACTFL nodes, and (when the pattern
 *      isn't UTF-8) EXACTF and EXACTFAA for such unfolded folds, and returns a
 *      boolean indicating whether or not the node contains such a fold.  When
 *      it is true, the caller sets a flag that later causes the optimizer in
 *      this file to not set values for the floating and fixed string lengths,
 *      and thus avoids the optimizer code in regexec.c that makes the invalid
 *      assumption.  Thus, there is no optimization based on string lengths for
 *      EXACTFL nodes that contain these few folds, nor for non-UTF8-pattern
 *      EXACTF and EXACTFAA nodes that contain the sharp s.  (The reason the
 *      assumption is wrong only in these cases is that all other non-UTF-8
 *      folds are 1-1; and, for UTF-8 patterns, we pre-fold all other folds to
 *      their expanded versions.  (Again, we can't prefold sharp s to 'ss' in
 *      EXACTF nodes because we don't know at compile time if it actually
 *      matches 'ss' or not.  For EXACTF nodes it will match iff the target
 *      string is in UTF-8.  This is in contrast to EXACTFU nodes, where it
 *      always matches; and EXACTFAA where it never does.  In an EXACTFAA node
 *      in a UTF-8 pattern, sharp s is folded to "\x{17F}\x{17F}, avoiding the
 *      problem; but in a non-UTF8 pattern, folding it to that above-Latin1
 *      string would require the pattern to be forced into UTF-8, the overhead
 *      of which we want to avoid.  Similarly the unfolded multi-char folds in
 *      EXACTFL nodes will match iff the locale at the time of match is a UTF-8
 *      locale.)
 *
 *      Similarly, the code that generates tries doesn't currently handle
 *      not-already-folded multi-char folds, and it looks like a pain to change
 *      that.  Therefore, trie generation of EXACTFAA nodes with the sharp s
 *      doesn't work.  Instead, such an EXACTFAA is turned into a new regnode,
 *      EXACTFAA_NO_TRIE, which the trie code knows not to handle.  Most people
 *      using /iaa matching will be doing so almost entirely with ASCII
 *      strings, so this should rarely be encountered in practice */

                   Assuming this was/is a branch we are dealing with: 'scan'
                   now points at the item that follows the branch sequence,
                   whatever it is. We now start at the beginning of the
                   sequence and look for subsequences of

                   BRANCH->EXACT=>x1
                   BRANCH->EXACT=>x2
                   tail

                   which would be constructed from a pattern like
                   /A|LIST|OF|WORDS/

                   If we can find such a subsequence we need to turn the first
                   element into a trie and then add the subsequent branch exact
                   strings to the trie.

                   We have two cases

                     1. patterns where the whole set of branches can be
                        converted.

                     2. patterns where only a subset can be converted.

                   In case 1 we can replace the whole set with a single regop
                   for the trie. In case 2 we need to keep the start and end
                   branches so

                     'BRANCH EXACT; BRANCH EXACT; BRANCH X'
                     becomes BRANCH TRIE; BRANCH X;

                  There is an additional case, that being where there is a
                  common prefix, which gets split out into an EXACT like node
                  preceding the TRIE node.

                  If x(1..n)==tail then we can do a simple trie, if not we make
                  a "jump" trie, such that when we match the appropriate word
                  we "jump" to the appropriate tail node. Essentially we turn
                  a nested if into a case structure of sorts.

                                noper is the first thing to be matched as part
                                      of that branch
                                noper_next is the regnext() of that node.

                            We normally handle a case like this
                            /FOO[xyz]|BAR[pqr]/ via a "jump trie" but we also
                            support building with NOJUMPTRIE, which restricts
                            the trie logic to structures like /FOO|BAR/.

                            If noper is a trieable nodetype then the branch is
                            a possible optimization target. If we are building
                            under NOJUMPTRIE then we require that noper_next is
                            the same as scan (our current position in the regex
                            program).

                            Once we have two or more consecutive such branches
                            we can create a trie of the EXACT's contents and
                            stitch it in place into the program.

                            If the sequence represents all of the branches in
                            the alternation we replace the entire thing with a
                            single TRIE node.

                            Otherwise when it is a subsequence we need to
                            stitch it in place and replace only the relevant
                            branches. This means the first branch has to remain
                            as it is used by the alternation logic, and its
                            next pointer, and needs to be repointed at the item
                            on the branch chain following the last branch we
                            have optimized away.

                            This could be either a BRANCH, in which case the
                            subsequence is internal, or it could be the item
                            following the branch sequence in which case the
                            subsequence is at the end (which does not
                            necessarily mean the first node is the start of the
                            alternation).

        /*
        At this point 'min' represents the minimum length string we can
        match while *ignoring* the implication of ACCEPT, and 'delta'
        represents the difference between the minimum length and maximum
        length, and if the pattern matches an infinitely long string
        (consider the + and * quantifiers) then we use the special delta
        value of OPTIMIZE_INFTY to represent it. 'stopmin' is the
        minimum length that can be matched *and* accepted.

        A pattern is accepted when matching was successful *and*
        complete, and thus there is no further matching needing to be
        done, no backtracking to occur, etc. Prior to the introduction
        of ACCEPT the only opcode that signaled acceptance was the END
        opcode, which is always the very last opcode in a regex program.
        ACCEPT is thus conceptually an early successful return out of
        the matching process. stopmin starts out as OPTIMIZE_INFTY to
        represent "the entire pattern", and is ratched down to the
        "current min" if necessary when an ACCEPT opcode is encountered.

        Thus stopmin might be smaller than min if we saw an (*ACCEPT),
        and we now need to account for it in both min and delta.
        Consider that in a pattern /AB/ normally the min length it can
        match can be computed as min(A)+min(B). But (*ACCEPT) means
        that it might be something else, not even neccesarily min(A) at
        all. Consider

             A  = /(foo(*ACCEPT)|x+)/
             B  = /whop/
             AB = /(foo(*ACCEPT)|x+)whop/

        The min for A is 1 for "x" and the delta for A is OPTIMIZE_INFTY
        for "xxxxx...", its stopmin is 3 for "foo". The min for B is 4 for
        "whop", and the delta of 0 as the pattern is of fixed length, the
        stopmin would be OPTIMIZE_INFTY as it does not contain an ACCEPT.
        When handling AB we expect to see a min of 5 for "xwhop", and a
        delta of OPTIMIZE_INFTY for "xxxxx...whop", and a stopmin of 3
        for "foo". This should result in a final min of 3 for "foo", and
        a final delta of OPTIMIZE_INFTY for "xxxxx...whop".

        In something like /(dude(*ACCEPT)|irk)x{3,7}/ we would have a
        min of 6 for "irkxxx" and a delta of 4 for "irkxxxxxxx", and the
        stop min would be 4 for "dude". This should result in a final
        min of 4 for "dude", and a final delta of 6, for "irkxxxxxxx".

        When min is smaller than stopmin then we can ignore it. In the
        fragment /(x{10,20}(*ACCEPT)|a)b+/, we would have a min of 2,
        and a delta of OPTIMIZE_INFTY, and a stopmin of 10. Obviously
        the ACCEPT doesn't reduce the minimum length of the string that
        might be matched, nor affect the maximum length.

        In something like /foo(*ACCEPT)ba?r/ we would have a min of 5
        for "foobr", a delta of 1 for "foobar", and a stopmin of 3 for
        "foo". We currently turn this into a min of 3 for "foo" and a
        delta of 3 for "foobar" even though technically "foobar" isn't
        possible. ACCEPT affects some aspects of the optimizer, like
        length computations and mandatory substring optimizations, but
        there are other optimzations this routine perfoms that are not
        affected and this compromise simplifies implementation.

        It might be helpful to consider that this C function is called
        recursively on the pattern in a bottom up fashion, and that the
        min returned by a nested call may be marked as coming from an
        ACCEPT, causing its callers to treat the returned min as a
        stopmin as the recursion unwinds. Thus a single ACCEPT can affect
        multiple calls into this function in different ways.

=for apidoc re_compile

Compile the regular expression pattern C<pattern>, returning a pointer to the
compiled object for later matching with the internal regex engine.

This function is typically used by a custom regexp engine C<.comp()> function
to hand off to the core regexp engine those patterns it doesn't want to handle
itself (typically passing through the same flags it was called with).  In
almost all other cases, a regexp should be compiled by calling L</C<pregcomp>>
to compile using the currently active regexp engine.

If C<pattern> is already a C<REGEXP>, this function does nothing but return a
pointer to the input.  Otherwise the PV is extracted and treated like a string
representing a pattern.  See L<perlre>.

The possible flags for C<rx_flags> are documented in L<perlreapi>.  Their names
all begin with C<RXf_>.

/*
 * Perl_re_op_compile - the perl internal RE engine's function to compile a
 * regular expression into internal code.
 * The pattern may be passed either as:
 *    a list of SVs (patternp plus pat_count)
 *    a list of OPs (expr)
 * If both are passed, the SV list is used, but the OP list indicates
 * which SVs are actually pre-compiled code blocks
 *
 * The SVs in the list have magic and qr overloading applied to them (and
 * the list may be modified in-place with replacement SVs in the latter
 * case).
 *
 * If the pattern hasn't changed from old_re, then old_re will be
 * returned.
 *
 * eng is the current engine. If that engine has an op_comp method, then
 * handle directly (i.e. we assume that op_comp was us); otherwise, just
 * do the initial concatenation of arguments and pass on to the external
 * engine.
 *
 * If is_bare_re is not null, set it to a boolean indicating whether the
 * arg list reduced (after overloading) to a single bare regex which has
 * been returned (i.e. /$qr/).
 *
 * orig_rx_flags contains RXf_* flags. See perlreapi.pod for more details.
 *
 * pm_flags contains the PMf_* flags, typically based on those from the
 * pm_flags field of the related PMOP. Currently we're only interested in
 * PMf_HAS_CV, PMf_IS_QR, PMf_USE_RE_EVAL, PMf_WILDCARD.
 *
 * For many years this code had an initial sizing pass that calculated
 * (sometimes incorrectly, leading to security holes) the size needed for the
 * compiled pattern.  That was changed by commit
 * 7c932d07cab18751bfc7515b4320436273a459e2 in 5.29, which reallocs the size, a
 * node at a time, as parsing goes along.  Patches welcome to fix any obsolete
 * references to this sizing pass.
 *
 * Now, an initial crude guess as to the size needed is made, based on the
 * length of the pattern.  Patches welcome to improve that guess.  That amount
 * of space is malloc'd and then immediately freed, and then clawed back node
 * by node.  This design is to minimze, to the extent possible, memory churn
 * when doing the reallocs.
 *
 * A separate parentheses counting pass may be needed in some cases.
 * (Previously the sizing pass did this.)  Patches welcome to reduce the number
 * of these cases.
 *
 * The existence of a sizing pass necessitated design decisions that are no
 * longer needed.  There are potential areas of simplification.
 *
 * Beware that the optimization-preparation code in here knows about some
 * of the structure of the compiled regexp.  [I'll say.]

/* This section of code defines the inversion list object and its methods.  The
 * interfaces are highly subject to change, so as much as possible is static to
 * this file.  An inversion list is here implemented as a malloc'd C UV array
 * as an SVt_INVLIST scalar.
 *
 * An inversion list for Unicode is an array of code points, sorted by ordinal
 * number.  Each element gives the code point that begins a range that extends
 * up-to but not including the code point given by the next element.  The final
 * element gives the first code point of a range that extends to the platform's
 * infinity.  The even-numbered elements (invlist[0], invlist[2], invlist[4],
 * ...) give ranges whose code points are all in the inversion list.  We say
 * that those ranges are in the set.  The odd-numbered elements give ranges
 * whose code points are not in the inversion list, and hence not in the set.
 * Thus, element [0] is the first code point in the list.  Element [1]
 * is the first code point beyond that not in the list; and element [2] is the
 * first code point beyond that that is in the list.  In other words, the first
 * range is invlist[0]..(invlist[1]-1), and all code points in that range are
 * in the inversion list.  The second range is invlist[1]..(invlist[2]-1), and
 * all code points in that range are not in the inversion list.  The third
 * range invlist[2]..(invlist[3]-1) gives code points that are in the inversion
 * list, and so forth.  Thus every element whose index is divisible by two
 * gives the beginning of a range that is in the list, and every element whose
 * index is not divisible by two gives the beginning of a range not in the
 * list.  If the final element's index is divisible by two, the inversion list
 * extends to the platform's infinity; otherwise the highest code point in the
 * inversion list is the contents of that element minus 1.
 *
 * A range that contains just a single code point N will look like
 *  invlist[i]   == N
 *  invlist[i+1] == N+1
 *
 * If N is UV_MAX (the highest representable code point on the machine), N+1 is
 * impossible to represent, so element [i+1] is omitted.  The single element
 * inversion list
 *  invlist[0] == UV_MAX
 * contains just UV_MAX, but is interpreted as matching to infinity.
 *
 * Taking the complement (inverting) an inversion list is quite simple, if the
 * first element is 0, remove it; otherwise add a 0 element at the beginning.
 * This implementation reserves an element at the beginning of each inversion
 * list to always contain 0; there is an additional flag in the header which
 * indicates if the list begins at the 0, or is offset to begin at the next
 * element.  This means that the inversion list can be inverted without any
 * copying; just flip the flag.
 *
 * More about inversion lists can be found in "Unicode Demystified"
 * Chapter 13 by Richard Gillam, published by Addison-Wesley.
 *
 * The inversion list data structure is currently implemented as an SV pointing
 * to an array of UVs that the SV thinks are bytes.  This allows us to have an
 * array of UV whose memory management is automatically handled by the existing
 * facilities for SV's.
 *
 * Some of the methods should always be private to the implementation, and some
 * should eventually be made public */

 *              be a nested subpattern, in which case S_reg is called
 *              recursively
 *
 * The functions generate regnodes as they go along, appending each to the
 * pattern data structure so far.  They return the offset of the current final
 * node into that structure, or 0 on failure.
 *
 * There are three parameters common to all of them:
 *   pRExC_state    is a structure with much information about the current
 *                  state of the parse.  It's easy to add new elements to
 *                  convey new information, but beware that an error return may
 *                  require clearing the element.
 *   flagp          is a pointer to bit flags set in a lower level to pass up
 *                  to higher levels information, such as the cause of a
 *                  failure, or some characteristic about the generated node
 *   depth          is roughly the recursion depth, mostly unused except for
 *                  pretty printing debugging info.
 *
 * There are ancillary functions that these may farm work out to, using the
 * same parameters.
 *
 * The protocol for handling flags is that each function will, before
 * returning, add into *flagp the flags it needs to pass up.  Each function has
 * a second flags variable, typically named 'flags', which it sets and clears
 * at will.  Flag bits in it are used in that function, and it calls the next
 * layer down with its 'flagp' parameter set to '&flags'.  Thus, upon return,
 * 'flags' will contain whatever it had before the call, plus whatever that
 * function passed up.  If it wants to pass any of these up to its caller, it
 * has to add them to its *flagp.  This means that it takes extra steps to keep
 * passing a flag upwards, and otherwise the flag bit is cleared for higher
 * functions.
 */

/* On success, returns the offset at which any next node should be placed into
 * the regex engine program being compiled.
 *
 * Returns 0 otherwise, with *flagp set to indicate why:
 *  TRYAGAIN        at the end of (?) that only sets flags.
 *  RESTART_PARSE   if the parse needs to be restarted, or'd with
 *                  NEED_UTF8 if the pattern needs to be upgraded to UTF-8.
 *  Otherwise would only return 0 if regbranch() returns 0, which cannot
 *  happen.  */

  * accordingly.  The input parameters constrain which meaning(s) is/are valid
  * in the current context.
  *
  * Exactly one of <node_p> and <code_point_p> must be non-NULL.
  *
  * If <code_point_p> is not NULL, the context is expecting the result to be a
  * single code point.  If this \N instance turns out to a single code point,
  * the function returns TRUE and sets *code_point_p to that code point.
  *
  * If <node_p> is not NULL, the context is expecting the result to be one of
  * the things representable by a regnode.  If this \N instance turns out to be
  * one such, the function generates the regnode, returns TRUE and sets *node_p
  * to point to the offset of that regnode into the regex engine program being
  * compiled.
  *
  * If this instance of \N isn't legal in any context, this function will
  * generate a fatal error and not return.
  *
  * On input, RExC_parse should point to the first char following the \N at the
  * time of the call.  On successful return, RExC_parse will have been updated
  * to point to just after the sequence identified by this routine.  Also
  * *flagp has been updated as needed.
  *
  * When there is some problem with the current context and this \N instance,
  * the function returns FALSE, without advancing RExC_parse, nor setting
  * *node_p, nor *code_point_p, nor *flagp.
  *
  * If <cp_count> is not NULL, the caller wants to know the length (in code
  * points) that this \N sequence matches.  This is set, and the input is
  * parsed for errors, even if the function returns FALSE, as detailed below.
  *
  * There are 6 possibilities here, as detailed in the next 6 paragraphs.
  *
  * Probably the most common case is for the \N to specify a single code point.
  * *cp_count will be set to 1, and *code_point_p will be set to that code
  * point.
  *
  * Another possibility is for the input to be an empty \N{}.  This is no
  * longer accepted, and will generate a fatal error.
  *
  * Another possibility is for a custom charnames handler to be in effect which
  * translates the input name to an empty string.  *cp_count will be set to 0.
  * *node_p will be set to a generated NOTHING node.
  *
  * Still another possibility is for the \N to mean [^\n]. *cp_count will be
  * set to 0. *node_p will be set to a generated REG_ANY node.
  *
  * The fifth possibility is that \N resolves to a sequence of more than one
  * code points.  *cp_count will be set to the number of code points in the
  * sequence. *node_p will be set to a generated node returned by this
  * function calling S_reg().
  *
  * The sixth and final possibility is that it is premature to be calling this
  * function; the parse needs to be restarted.  This can happen when this
  * changes from /d to /u rules, or when the pattern needs to be upgraded to
  * UTF-8.  The latter occurs only when the fifth possibility would otherwise
  * be in effect, and is because one of those code points requires the pattern
  * to be recompiled as UTF-8.  The function returns FALSE, and sets the
  * RESTART_PARSE and NEED_UTF8 flags in *flagp, as appropriate.  When this
  * happens, the caller needs to desist from continuing parsing, and return
  * this information to its caller.  This is not set for when there is only one
  * code point, as this can be called as part of an ANYOF node, and they can
  * store above-Latin1 code points without the pattern having to be in UTF-8.
  *
  * For non-single-quoted regexes, the tokenizer has resolved character and
  * sequence names inside \N{...} into their Unicode values, normalizing the
  * result into what we should see here: '\N{U+c1.c2...}', where c1... are the
  * hex-represented code points in the sequence.  This is done there because
  * the names can vary based on what charnames pragma is in scope at the time,
  * so we need a way to take a snapshot of what they resolve to at the time of
  * the original parse. [perl #56444].
  *
  * That parsing is skipped for single-quoted regexes, so here we may get
  * '\N{NAME}', which is parsed now.  If the single-quoted regex is something
  * like '\N{U+41}', that code point is Unicode, and has to be translated into
  * the native character set for non-ASCII platforms.  The other possibilities
  * are already native, so no translation is done. */

/*
 - regatom - the lowest level

   Try to identify anything special at the start of the current parse position.
   If there is, then handle it as required. This may involve generating a
   single regop, such as for an assertion; or it may involve recursing, such as
   to handle a () structure.

   If the string doesn't start with something special then we gobble up
   as much literal text as we can.  If we encounter a quantifier, we have to
   back off the final literal character, as that quantifier applies to just it
   and not to the whole string of literals.

   Once we have been able to handle whatever type of thing started the
   sequence, we return the offset into the regex engine program being compiled
   at which any  next regnode should be placed.

   Returns 0, setting *flagp to TRYAGAIN if reg() returns 0 with TRYAGAIN.
   Returns 0, setting *flagp to RESTART_PARSE if the parse needs to be
   restarted, or'd with NEED_UTF8 if the pattern needs to be upgraded to UTF-8
   Otherwise does not return 0.

   Note: we have to be careful with escapes, as they can be both literal
   and special, and in the case of \10 and friends, context determines which.

   A summary of the code structure is:

   switch (first_byte) {
        cases for each special:
            handle this special;
            break;
        case '\\':
            switch (2nd byte) {
                cases for each unambiguous special:
                    handle this special;
                    break;
                cases for each ambigous special/literal:
                    disambiguate;
                    if (special)  handle here
                    else goto defchar;
                default: // unambiguously literal:
                    goto defchar;
            }
        default:  // is a literal char
            // FALL THROUGH
        defchar:
            create EXACTish node for literal;
            while (more input and node isn't full) {
                switch (input_byte) {
                   cases for each special;
                       make sure parse pointer is set so that the next call to
                           regatom will see this special first
                       goto loopdone; // EXACTish node terminated by prev. char
                   default:
                       append char to EXACTISH node;
                }
                get next input byte;
            }
        loopdone:
   }
   return the generated node;

   Specifically there are two separate switches for handling
   escape sequences, with the one for handling literal escapes requiring
   a dummy entry for all of the special escapes that are actually handled
   by the other.

                 * that it is something that would form the completion of a
                 * multi-char fold.
                 *
                 * If we can't split between s and ender, we work backwards
                 * character-by-character down to s0.  At each current point

                 *
                 * If we're not at the beginning, we still could be at the

     * In b) there may be errors or warnings generated.  If 'check_only' is
     * TRUE, then any errors are discarded.  Warnings are returned to the
     * caller via an AV* created into '*posix_warnings' if it is not NULL.  If
     * instead it is NULL, warnings are suppressed.
     *
     * The reason for this function, and its complexity is that a bracketed
     * character class can contain just about anything.  But it's easy to
     * mistype the very specific posix class syntax but yielding a valid
     * regular bracketed class, so it silently gets compiled into something
     * quite unintended.
     *
     * The solution adopted here maintains backward compatibility except that
     * it adds a warning if it looks like a posix class was intended but
     * improperly specified.  The warning is not raised unless what is input
     * very closely resembles one of the 14 legal posix classes.  To do this,
     * it uses fuzzy parsing.  It calculates how many single-character edits it
     * would take to transform what was input into a legal posix class.  Only
     * if that number is quite small does it think that the intention was a
     * posix class.  Obviously these are heuristics, and there will be cases
     * where it errs on one side or another, and they can be tweaked as
     * experience informs.
     *
     * The syntax for a legal posix class is:
     *
     * qr/(?xa: \[ : \^? [[:lower:]]{4,6} : \] )/
     *
     * What this routine considers syntactically to be an intended posix class
     * is this (the comments indicate some restrictions that the pattern
     * doesn't show):
     *
     *  qr/(?x: \[?                         # The left bracket, possibly
     *                                      # omitted
     *          \h*                         # possibly followed by blanks
     *          (?: \^ \h* )?               # possibly a misplaced caret
     *          [:;]?                       # The opening class character,

     * know how to pronounce it you can use the correct term, thus giving due
     * credit to the person who invented it, and impressing your geek friends.
     * Wikipedia says that the pronounciation of "Ł" has been changing so that
     * it is now more like an English initial W (as in wonk) than an L.)
     *
     * This means that, for example, 'a | b & c' is stored on the stack as
     *
     * c  [4]
     * b  [3]
     * &  [2]
     * a  [1]
     * |  [0]
     *
     * where the numbers in brackets give the stack [array] element number.
     * In this implementation, parentheses are not stored on the stack.
     * Instead a '(' creates a "fence" so that the part of the stack below the
     * fence is invisible except to the corresponding ')' (this allows us to
     * replace testing for parens, by using instead subtraction of the fence
     * position).  As new operands are processed they are pushed onto the stack
     * (except as noted in the next paragraph).  New operators of higher
     * precedence than the current final one are inserted on the stack before
     * the lhs operand (so that when the rhs is pushed next, everything will be
     * in the correct positions shown above.  When an operator of equal or
     * lower precedence is encountered in parsing, all the stacked operations
     * of equal or higher precedence are evaluated, leaving the result as the
     * top entry on the stack.  This makes higher precedence operations
     * evaluate before lower precedence ones, and causes operations of equal
     * precedence to left associate.
     *
     * The only unary operator '!' is immediately pushed onto the stack when
     * encountered.  When an operand is encountered, if the top of the stack is
     * a '!", the complement is immediately performed, and the '!' popped.  The
     * resulting value is treated as a new operand, and the logic in the
     * previous paragraph is executed.  Thus in the expression
     *      [a] + ! [b]
     * the stack looks like
     *
     * !
     * a
     * +
     *
     * as 'b' gets parsed, the latter gets evaluated to '!b', and the stack
     * becomes
     *
     * !b
     * a
     * +
     *
     * A ')' is treated as an operator with lower precedence than all the
     * aforementioned ones, which causes all operations on the stack above the
     * corresponding '(' to be evaluated down to a single resultant operand.
     * Then the fence for the '(' is removed, and the operand goes through the
     * algorithm above, without the fence.
     *
     * A separate stack is kept of the fence positions, so that the position of
     * the latest so-far unbalanced '(' is at the top of it.
     *
     * The ']' ending the construct is treated as the lowest operator of all,
     * so that everything gets evaluated down to a single operand, which is the
     * result */

This is experimental code. The idea is to use this routine to perform
in place optimizations on branches and groups as they are constructed,
with the long term intention of removing optimization from study_chunk so
that it is purely analytical.

Currently only used when in DEBUG mode. The macro REGTAIL_STUDY() is used
to control which is which.

This used to return a value that was ignored.  It was a problem that it is
#ifdef'd to be another function that didn't return a value.  khw has changed it
so both currently return a pass/fail return.

    This function is used in two main ways. First to implement
        $r = qr/....; $s = $$r;

    Secondly, it is used as a hacky workaround to the structural issue of
    match results
    being stored in the regexp structure which is in turn stored in
    PL_curpm/PL_reg_curpm. The problem is that due to qr// the pattern
    could be PL_curpm in multiple contexts, and could require multiple
    result sets being associated with the pattern simultaneously, such
    as when doing a recursive match with (??{$qr})

    The solution is to make a lightweight copy of the regexp structure
    when a qr// is returned from the code executed by (??{$qr}) this
    lightweight copy doesn't actually own any of its data except for
    the starp/end and the actual regexp structure itself.

Duplicate a regexp.

This routine is expected to clone a given regexp structure. It is only
compiled under USE_ITHREADS.

After all of the core data stored in struct regexp is duplicated
the C<regexp_engine.dupe> method is used to copy any private data
stored in the *pprivate pointer. This allows extensions to handle
any duplication they need to do.

This code was mainly added for backcompat to give a warning for non-portable
code points in user-defined properties.  But experiments showed that the
warning in earlier perls were only omitted on overflow, which should be an
error, so there really isnt a backcompat issue, and actually adding the
warning when none was present before might cause breakage, for little gain.  So
khw left this code in, but not enabled.  Tests were never added.

             * of the expanding thread during the expansion.  Again the SV type
