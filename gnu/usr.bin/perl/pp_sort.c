/*
** Overview of algorithm and variables.
** The array of elements at list1 will be organized into runs of length 2,
** or runs of length >= 2 * PTHRESH.  We only try to form long runs when
** PTHRESH adjacent pairs compare in the same way, suggesting overall order.
**
** Unless otherwise specified, pair pointers address the first of two elements.
**
** b and b+1 are a pair that compare with sense "sense".
** b is the "bottom" of adjacent pairs that might form a longer run.
**
** p2 parallels b in the list2 array, where runs are defined by
** a pointer chain.
**
** t represents the "top" of the adjacent pairs that might extend
** the run beginning at b.  Usually, t addresses a pair
** that compares with opposite sense from (b,b+1).
** However, it may also address a singleton element at the end of list1,
** or it may be equal to "last", the first element beyond list1.
**
** r addresses the Nth pair following b.  If this would be beyond t,
** we back it off to t.  Only when r is less than t do we consider the
** run long enough to consider checking.
**
** q addresses a pair such that the pairs at b through q already form a run.
** Often, q will equal b, indicating we only are sure of the pair itself.
** However, a search on the previous cycle may have revealed a longer run,
** so q may be greater than b.
**
** p is used to work back from a candidate r, trying to reach q,
** which would mean b through r would be a run.  If we discover such a run,
** we start q at r and try to push it further towards t.
** If b through r is NOT a run, we detect the wrong order at (p-1,p).
** In any event, after the check (if any), we have two main cases.
**
** 1) Short run.  b <= q < p <= r <= t.
**	b through q is a run (perhaps trivial)
**	q through p are uninteresting pairs
**	p through r is a run
**
** 2) Long run.  b < r <= q < t.
**	b through q is a run (of length >= 2 * PTHRESH)
**
** Note that degenerate cases are not only possible, but likely.
** For example, if the pair following b compares with opposite sense,
** then b == q < p == r == t.

/* The original merge sort, in use since 5.7, was as fast as, or faster than,
 * qsort on many platforms, but slower than qsort, conspicuously so,
 * on others.  The most likely explanation was platform-specific
 * differences in cache sizes and relative speeds.
 *
 * The quicksort divide-and-conquer algorithm guarantees that, as the
 * problem is subdivided into smaller and smaller parts, the parts
 * fit into smaller (and faster) caches.  So it doesn't matter how
 * many levels of cache exist, quicksort will "find" them, and,
 * as long as smaller is faster, take advantage of them.
 *
 * By contrast, consider how the original mergesort algorithm worked.
 * Suppose we have five runs (each typically of length 2 after dynprep).
 * 
 * pass               base                        aux
 *  0              1 2 3 4 5
 *  1                                           12 34 5
 *  2                1234 5
 *  3                                            12345
 *  4                 12345
 *
 * Adjacent pairs are merged in "grand sweeps" through the input.
 * This means, on pass 1, the records in runs 1 and 2 aren't revisited until
 * runs 3 and 4 are merged and the runs from run 5 have been copied.
 * The only cache that matters is one large enough to hold *all* the input.
 * On some platforms, this may be many times slower than smaller caches.
 *
 * The following pseudo-code uses the same basic merge algorithm,
 * but in a divide-and-conquer way.
 *
 * # merge $runs runs at offset $offset of list $list1 into $list2.
 * # all unmerged runs ($runs == 1) originate in list $base.
 * sub mgsort2 {
 *     my ($offset, $runs, $base, $list1, $list2) = @_;
 *
 *     if ($runs == 1) {
 *         if ($list1 is $base) copy run to $list2
 *         return offset of end of list (or copy)
 *     } else {
 *         $off2 = mgsort2($offset, $runs-($runs/2), $base, $list2, $list1)
 *         mgsort2($off2, $runs/2, $base, $list2, $list1)
 *         merge the adjacent runs at $offset of $list1 into $list2
 *         return the offset of the end of the merged runs
 *     }
 * }
 * mgsort2(0, $runs, $base, $aux, $base);
 *
 * For our 5 runs, the tree of calls looks like 
 *
 *           5
 *      3        2
 *   2     1   1   1
 * 1   1
 *
 * 1   2   3   4   5
 *
 * and the corresponding activity looks like
 *
 * copy runs 1 and 2 from base to aux
 * merge runs 1 and 2 from aux to base
 * (run 3 is where it belongs, no copy needed)
 * merge runs 12 and 3 from base to aux
 * (runs 4 and 5 are where they belong, no copy needed)
 * merge runs 4 and 5 from base to aux
 * merge runs 123 and 45 from aux to base
 *
 * Note that we merge runs 1 and 2 immediately after copying them,
 * while they are still likely to be in fast cache.  Similarly,
 * run 3 is merged with run 12 while it still may be lingering in cache.
 * This implementation should therefore enjoy much of the cache-friendly
 * behavior that quicksort does.  In addition, it does less copying
 * than the original mergesort implementation (only runs 1 and 2 are copied)
 * and the "balancing" of merges is better (merged runs comprise more nearly
 * equal numbers of original runs).
 *
 * The actual cache-friendly implementation will use a pseudo-stack
 * to avoid recursion, and will unroll processing of runs of length 2,
 * but it is otherwise similar to the recursive implementation.

         /* OK, this is gonna get hairy, so lets try to document all the
            concepts and abbreviations and variables and what they keep
            track of:

            pc: pivot chunk - the set of array elements we accumulate in the
                middle of the partition, all equal in value to the original
                pivot element selected. The pc is defined by:

                pc_left - the leftmost array index of the pc
                pc_right - the rightmost array index of the pc

                we start with pc_left == pc_right and only one element
                in the pivot chunk (but it can grow during the scan).

            u:  uncompared elements - the set of elements in the partition
                we have not yet compared to the pivot value. There are two
                uncompared sets during the scan - one to the left of the pc
                and one to the right.

                u_right - the rightmost index of the left side's uncompared set
                u_left - the leftmost index of the right side's uncompared set

                The leftmost index of the left sides's uncompared set
                doesn't need its own variable because it is always defined
                by the leftmost edge of the whole partition (part_left). The
                same goes for the rightmost edge of the right partition
                (part_right).

                We know there are no uncompared elements on the left once we
                get u_right < part_left and no uncompared elements on the
                right once u_left > part_right. When both these conditions
                are met, we have completed the scan of the partition.

                Any elements which are between the pivot chunk and the
                uncompared elements should be less than the pivot value on
                the left side and greater than the pivot value on the right
                side (in fact, the goal of the whole algorithm is to arrange
                for that to be true and make the groups of less-than and
                greater-then elements into new partitions to sort again).

            As you marvel at the complexity of the code and wonder why it
            has to be so confusing. Consider some of the things this level
            of confusion brings:

            Once I do a compare, I squeeze every ounce of juice out of it. I
            never do compare calls I don't have to do, and I certainly never
            do redundant calls.

            I also never swap any elements unless I can prove there is a
            good reason. Many sort algorithms will swap a known value with
            an uncompared value just to get things in the right place (or
            avoid complexity :-), but that uncompared value, once it gets
            compared, may then have to be swapped again. A lot of the
            complexity of this code is due to the fact that it never swaps
            anything except compared values, and it only swaps them when the
            compare shows they are out of position.
         */
         int pc_left, pc_right;
         int u_right, u_left;

         int s;

         pc_left = ((part_left + part_right) / 2);
         pc_right = pc_left;
         u_right = pc_left - 1;
         u_left = pc_right + 1;

         /* Qsort works best when the pivot value is also the median value
            in the partition (unfortunately you can't find the median value
            without first sorting :-), so to give the algorithm a helping
            hand, we pick 3 elements and sort them and use the median value
            of that tiny set as the pivot value.

            Some versions of qsort like to use the left middle and right as
            the 3 elements to sort so they can insure the ends of the
            partition will contain values which will stop the scan in the
            compare loop, but when you have to call an arbitrarily complex
            routine to do a compare, its really better to just keep track of
            array index values to know when you hit the edge of the
            partition and avoid the extra compare. An even better reason to
            avoid using a compare call is the fact that you can drop off the
            edge of the array if someone foolishly provides you with an
            unstable compare function that doesn't always provide consistent
            results.

            So, since it is simpler for us to compare the three adjacent
            elements in the middle of the partition, those are the ones we
            pick here (conveniently pointed at by u_right, pc_left, and
            u_left). The values of the left, center, and right elements
            are referred to as l c and r in the following comments.

            chunk.

            Notes on the QSORT_ORDER_GUESS ifdef code:

            1. If I just built these partitions without swapping any (or
               very many) elements, there is a chance that the elements are
               already ordered properly (being properly ordered will
               certainly result in no swapping, but the converse can't be
               proved :-).

            2. A (properly written) insertion sort will run faster on
               already ordered data than qsort will.

            3. Perhaps there is some way to make a good guess about
               switching to an insertion sort earlier than partition size 6
               (for instance - we could save the partition size on the stack
               and increase the size each time we find we didn't swap, thus
               switching to insertion sort earlier for partitions with a
               history of not swapping).

            4. Naturally, if I just switch right away, it will make
               artificial benchmarks with pure ascending (or descending)
               data look really good, but is that a good reason in general?
               Hard to say...
