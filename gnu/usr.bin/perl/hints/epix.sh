#  This hint file appears to be based on the svr4 hints for perl5.000,
#  with some CDC-specific additions.  I've tried to updated it to
#  match the 5.001 svr4 hints, which allow for dynamic loading,
#  but I have no way of testing the resulting file.
#
#  There were also some contradictions that I've tried to straighten
#  out, but I'm not sure I got them all right.

# Edit config.sh to change shmattype from 'char *' to 'void *'"

# Use Configure -Dcc=gcc to use gcc.
