Some users have reported that Configure halts when testing for
the O_NONBLOCK symbol with a syntax error.  This is apparently a
sh error.  Rerunning Configure with ksh apparently fixes the
problem.  Try
	ksh Configure [your options]

POSIX threads are not supported well by FreeBSD $osvers.

Please consider upgrading to at least FreeBSD 2.2.8,
or preferably to the most recent -RELEASE or -STABLE
version (see http://www.freebsd.org/releases/).

(While 2.2.7 does have pthreads, it has some problems
 with the combination of threads and pipes and therefore
 many Perl tests will either hang or fail.)

POSIX threads should be supported by FreeBSD $osvers --
but your system is missing the shared libc_r.
(/sbin/ldconfig -r doesn't find any).

Consider using the latest STABLE release.
