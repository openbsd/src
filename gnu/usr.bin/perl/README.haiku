=head1 NAME

perlhaiku - Perl version 5.10+ on Haiku

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains instructions how to build Perl for Haiku and lists
known problems.

=head1 BUILD AND INSTALL

The build procedure is completely standard:

  ./Configure -de
  make
  make install

Make perl executable and create a symlink for libperl:

  chmod a+x /boot/common/bin/perl
  cd /boot/common/lib; ln -s perl5/5.30.3/BePC-haiku/CORE/libperl.so .

Replace C<5.30.3> with your respective version of Perl.

=head1 KNOWN PROBLEMS

The following problems are encountered with Haiku revision 28311:

=over 4

=item *

Perl cannot be compiled with threading support ATM.

=item *

The F<cpan/Socket/t/socketpair.t> test fails. More precisely: the subtests
using datagram sockets fail. Unix datagram sockets aren't implemented in
Haiku yet.

=item *

A subtest of the F<cpan/Sys-Syslog/t/syslog.t> test fails. This is due to Haiku
not implementing F</dev/log> support yet.

=item *

The tests F<dist/Net-Ping/t/450_service.t> and F<dist/Net-Ping/t/510_ping_udp.t>
fail. This is due to bugs in Haiku's network stack implementation.
