IO 1.38 -- Apr 19 2018 - Todd Rinaldo
  * Remove pre 5.8 logic from code base.
  * Bump all IO modules to 1.38 and set required Perl to 5.8.1
  * Fix for perl #125723
  * IO test: adjust require for non CORE perl
  * IO::Handle - fix precedence issue
  * Document IO::Select error detection
  * Rely on C89 <time.h>
  * (perl #130856) deal with unpack_sockaddr_un() croaking

  * dist/: remove . from @INC when loading optional modules
  * Fix IO::Handle documentation mangled by a manually applied patch
  * Make IO::Poll->poll call _poll even with an empty fd array
  * Fix assertion when calling IO::Poll::_poll() with an empty fd array
  * Some BSD implementations might have <sys/poll.h> instead of <poll.h>.

IO 1.36 -- Jun 26 2015 (Not released to CPAN)
  * dist/IO/t/io_utf8argv.t: Generalize for non-ASCII platforms.
  * VMS does have fsync, so configure accordingly.
  * Skip obsolete skip in io_xs.t.
  * Label conditionally unused.
  * Use <sys/poll.h> if available before going select().
  * Fix assertion when calling IO::Poll::_poll() with an empty fd array
  * Make IO::Poll->poll call _poll even with an empty fd array

IO 1.35 -- Dec 7 2014 (Not released to CPAN)
  * Change OP_SIBLING to OpSIBLING
  * Improve connected() doc
  * IRIX: fsync documented to fail on read-only filehandles.
  * Convert all use of Test.pm to Test::More

IO 1.34 -- Sep 10 2014 (Not released to CPAN)
  * Add dual life support for use of op_sibling in IO.xs

IO 1.33 -- Jun 10 2014 (Not released to CPAN)
  * wrap op_sibling field access in OP_SIBLING* macros
  *  Make like() and unlike() in t/test.pl refuse non-qr// arguments
  * Further simplify the sockatmark(). (And do not assign the fd in PREINIT.)

IO 1.32 -- May 29 2014 (Not released to CPAN)
  * fcntl receiving -1 from fileno, fcntl failing.
  * Also very few spots of negative numgroups for getgroups(), and fgetc() return, but almost all checking is for fcntl.
  * merged fix for perl #121743 and perl #121745: hopefully picked up all the fixes-to-fixes from the ticket.
  * Fix for Coverity perl5 CIDs 28990..29003,29005..29011,29013,45354,45363,49926
  * Argument cannot be negative (NEGATIVE_RETURNS) fd is passed to a parameter that cannot be negative.
  * CIDs 29004, 29012: Argument cannot be negative (NEGATIVE_RETURNS) num_groups is passed to a parameter that cannot be negative and because of CIDs 29005 and 29006 also CID 28924.
  * In the first set of issues a fd is retrieved from PerlIO_fileno, and that is then used in places like fstat(), fchown(), dup(), etc., without checking whether the fd is valid (>=0).
  * In the second set of issues a potentially negative number is potentially passed to getgroups().
  * The CIDs 29005 and 29006 were a bit messy: fixing them needed also resolving CID 28924 where the return value of fstat() was ignored, and for completeness adding two croak calls (with perldiag updates): a bit of a waste since it's suidperl code. 

IO 1.31 -- Mar 4 2014 (Not released to CPAN)

  * dist/IO/t/io_pipe.t: Work around android only having an inbuilt echo
  * Add examples for IO::Socket::UNIX.
  * Remove an old note about autoflush from the POD.
  * ioctl on perlhost platforms take a char*, not void*

  * [perl #75156] fix the return value and bits for removing a closed fh

  * Fix IO::Socket::connect() in the light of $! changes

IO 1.29 -- Mar 15 2013 (Not released to CPAN)
  * Use separate macros for byte vs uv Unicode
  * IO::Socket::INET's documentation for its Listen parameter was somewhat misleading, and the documentation for IO::Socket::Unix even more so.
  * Address [perl #117999] for now by skipping known bad test on AIX
  * [perl #117791] Clarify that write does not match the C 'write' semantics

	  - IO::Socket::INET default to protocol 'tcp'
	
	o IO::File

	o IO::Handle
	  - Removed use of AutoLoader for constants, constants are
	    now defined as constant XS subs
	  - Added fsync, but will not be available for use
	    unless HAS_FSYNC is defined, perls configure does not define
	    this yet.
	  - Moved bootstrap of IO.xs to IO.pm. IO::Handle no longer
	    contains an AUTOLOAD sub in it's ISA hier

	o IO::Seekable
	  - Remove clearerr, as it is defined in IO.xs

	o IO.xs
	  - Patched IO.xs with patch from Chip for setvbuf warning

	    specific package
	  - Changed all $fh variables in IO::Handle to $io and all $fh
	    variables in IO::Socket to $sock as Chip suggested
	  - Fixed usage messages to be consistent

*** Release 1.15

Sun 19 Jan 1997 <bodg@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o Updated PODs for IO::Handle and IO::File
	o Modified IO.xs so that DESTROY gets called on IO::File
	  objects that were created with IO::File->new_tmpfile
	o Modified the domain2pkg code in IO::Socket so that it
	  does not use blessed refs
	o Created a new package IO::Pipe::End so that pipe specific
	  stuff can be moved out of IO::Handle.
	o Added Ilya's OS/2 changes to Pipe.pm and io_pipe.t

	o These changes happened sometime before the release of 1.15
	  - added shutdown to IO::Socket
	  - modified connect to not use alarm
	  - modified accept and connect to use IO::Select

*** Release 1.14

Tue 24 Dec 1996 <bodg@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o IO::Handle::syswrite was calling sysread, fixed :-)

*** Release 1.12

Thu 19 Sep 1996 <bodg@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o Modified IO.xs so that it will compile with pre perlio version
	  of perl (ie pre perl5.003_02)

	  if the socket is connected

	  was removed.
	o Added count method to IO::Select
	o Renamed and modified tests so that they can be copied into the
	  perl distribution
	o Added fcntl and ioctl methods to IO::Handle

Thu 25 Jul 1996 <bodg@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o It is now not necessary to call the domain sub-classes of
	  IO::Socket. when connect is called it notes the domain.
	  Domain specific methods, which are normally non-critical, are
	  called via this note-ing.
	o Added methods to IO::Socket to retrieve the domain, type and
	  protocol of a given socket

Tue 23 Jul 1996 <bodg@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o IO::Socket::connect changed how we do timeouts, as it did not work

	o IO::Handle::new_from_fd removed method call to _ref_fd, which was
	  a leftover from FileHandle

Fri 28 Jun 1996 <bodg@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o Modified IO::Socket::UNIX::configure to default to using a socket
	  type of SOCK_STREAM if no type is specified.
