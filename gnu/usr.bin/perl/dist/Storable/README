| We thank Raphael Manfredi for providing us with this very useful module.
+=======================================================================

The Storable extension brings persistence to your data.

You may recursively store to disk any data structure, no matter how
complex and circular it is, provided it contains only SCALAR, ARRAY,
HASH (possibly tied) and references (possibly blessed) to those items.

At a later stage, or in another program, you may retrieve data from
the stored file and recreate the same hiearchy in memory. If you
had blessed references, the retrieved references are blessed into
the same package, so you must make sure you have access to the
same perl class than the one used to create the relevant objects.

There is also a dclone() routine which performs an optimized mirroring
of any data structure, preserving its topology.

Objects (blessed references) may also redefine the way storage and
retrieval is performed, and/or what deep cloning should do on those
objects.

To compile this extension, run:

    perl Makefile.PL [PERL_SRC=...where you put perl sources...]
    make
    make install

There is an embedded POD manual page in Storable.pm.

Storable was written by Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>
Maintenance is now done by cperl, https://github.com/rurban/Storable/
Note that p5p still ships an old broken version, without stack overflow
protection and large object support. As long as you don't store overlarge
objects, they are compatible.

Please e-mail us with problems, bug fixes, comments and complaints,
although if you have complements you should send them to Raphael.
Please don't e-mail Raphael with problems, as he no longer works on
Storable, and your message will be delayed while he forwards it to us.
