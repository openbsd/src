    C++ types.
  - More tests ported from core.

3.18_02 - Mon Apr 15 07:30:00 CET 2013
  - ExtUtils::ParseXS no longer uses global state (if using OO
    interface).
  - New "real" OO interface.

3.18_01 - Thu Apr 11 19:17:00 CET 2013
  - ExtUtils::Typemaps gains a clone method.

3.13_01 - Sat Jan 29 12:45:00 CET 2012
  - ExtUtils::Typemaps:
    => Embedded typemap dumping: A method which will produce the
       verbatim string for inclusion in XS.
    => Introducing ExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd, a helper module which
       can produce embedded typemap strings via simple one-liners.
       Useful for including typemaps from other modules in XS code
       with INCLUDE_COMMAND. See "perldoc ExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd".

  - ExtUtils::ParseXS:
    => Bugfix: Used to have parsing problems with embedded typemaps
       occasionally.
    => Better error messages on typemap-related issues. If a no
       typemap was found for a given C type, list all mapped C types
       so that the user hopefully spots his mistake easily.

3.11 - Thu Dec 29 17:55:00 CET 2011
  - Version/distribution fixes.

3.09 - Wed Dec 28 18:48:00 CET 2011
  - Escape double quotes of file names/commands in #line directives.

3.08 - Mon Dec 19 18:03:00 CET 2011
  - Silence undefined-value-in-addition warning
    (Nothing serious, just happened sometimes when reporting line numbers for
    errors. But warning during build process.)

3.07 - Wed Dec  7 14:10:00 CET 2011
  - Fix inconsistent versioning in 3.06.

3.06 - Fri Dec  2 08:10:00 CET 2011

  - Fix Cygwin issues [Tony Cook]
    avoid conflicting static / dllexport on legacy perls too
    This probably fixes rt.cpan.org 72313 and 71964.
    (3928a66ad4bd8aee704eda1942b7877c0ff1ab2c in core)

  - Convert ` to ' [James Keenan]
    55bee391aeff3c3b8d22fa4ce5491ee9440028aa and
    6dfee1ec62c64d7afe8ced4650596dd9e7f71a63 in core

  - Avoid some test-time warnings [Zefram]
    97bae9c59cd181b3b54061213ec1fdce0ccb30d4 in core

3.05 - Wed Oct  5 08:14:00 CET 2011

  - No functional changes, promoted to stable release.

3.04_04 - Mon Sep 12 08:12:00 CET 2011

  - Simplify generated XS code by emitting a compatibility version
    of dVAR. [Nicholas Clark]

  - Fixed "INCLUDE: $cmd |", CPAN RT #70213

3.04_03 - Sun Sep  4 18:49:00 CET 2011

  - By #defining PERL_EUPXS_ALWAYS_EXPORT or
    PERL_EUPXS_NEVER_EXPORT early in your XS code, you can
    force ExtUtils::ParseXS to always or never export
    XSUB symbols. This has no effect on boot_* symbols since
    those must be exported.

3.04_02 - Sat Sep  3 15:28:00 CET 2011

  - Don't put null characters into the generated source
    file when -except is used; write the '\0' escape sequence
    properly instead. [Stephen Bennett]

3.04_01 - Sun Aug 28 17:50:00 CET 2011

  - The XSUB.h changes to make XS(name) use XS_INTERNAL(name)
    by default (which were in the 5.15.2 dev release of perl)
    have been reverted since too many CPAN modules expect to
    be able to refer to XSUBs declared with XS(name).
    Instead, ExtUtils::ParseXS will define a copy of the
    XS_INTERNAL/XS_EXTERNAL macros as necessary going back to
    perl 5.10.0 (which is the oldest perl I had for testing).
    By default, ExtUtils::ParseXS will use XS_INTERNAL(name)
    instead of XS(name).

3.04 - Thu Aug 25 08:20:00 CET 2011

  - Stable release based on 3.03_03, no functional changes.

3.03_03 - Wed Aug 24 19:43:00 CET 2011

  - Try to fix regression for input-typemap override in XS argument
    list. (CPAN RT #70448)

  - Explicit versions in submodules to fail early if something
    goes wrong.

3.03_02 - Sun Aug 21 13:19:00 CET 2011

  - Properly strip trailing semicolons form inputmaps. These could
    trigger warnings (errors in strict C89 compilers) due to
    additional semicolons being interpreted as empty statements.
    [Torsten Schoenfeld, Jan Dubois, Steffen Mueller]

  - Now detects and throws a warning if there is a CODE section using
    RETVAL, but no OUTPUT section. [CPAN RT #69536]

  - Uses the explicit XS_EXTERNAL macro (from perl 5.15.2 and newer)
    for XSUBs that need to be exported. Defines XS_EXTERNAL to fall
    back to XS where that is not available.

  - Introduces new EXPORT_XSUB_SYMBOLS XS keyword that forces exported
    XSUB symbols. It's a no-op on perls before 5.15.2.

3.03 - Thu Aug 11 08:24:00 CET 2011

  - Test fix: Try all @INC-derived typemap locations. (CPAN RT #70047)
    [Mike Sheldrake]

3.02 - Thu Aug  4 18:19:00 CET 2011

  - Test fix: Use File::Spec->catfile instead of catdir where appropriate.

3.01 - Thu Aug  4 17:51:00 CET 2011

  - No significant changes from 3.00_05.

3.00_05 - Wed Jul 27 22:54:00 CET 2011

  - Define PERL_UNUSED_ARG for pre-3.8.9 perls.
    This should fix the tests on those perls.

3.00_04 - Wed Jul 27 22:22:00 CET 2011

  - Require perl 5.8.1.

  - Patches from CPAN RT #53938, #61908
    Both of these are attempts to fix win32 problems:
    Bug #61908 for ExtUtils-ParseXS: MSWin compilers and back-slashed paths
    Bug #53938 for ExtUtils-ParseXS: MinGW Broken after 2.21

3.00_03 - Fri Jul 22 20:13:00 CET 2011

  - Add some diagnostics when xsubpp fails to load a current-enough
    version of ExtUtils::ParseXS. [Steffen Mueller]

  - Add a check to Makefile.PL that scans @INC to determine whether
    the new xsubpp will be shadowed by another, existing xsubpp
    and warn the user vehemently. [Steffen Mueller]

3.00_02 - Thu Jul 14 18:00:00 CET 2011

  - Move script/xsubpp back to lib/ExtUtils/xsubpp
    The original move caused old xsubpp's to be used.

3.00_01 - Tue Jul 12 22:00:00 CET 2011

  - Major refactoring of the whole code base.
    It finally runs under 'use strict' for the first time!
    [James Keenan, Steffen Mueller]

  - Typemaps can now be embedded into XS code using a here-doc
    like syntax and the new "TYPEMAP:" XS keyword.
    [Steffen Mueller]

  - Move typemap handling code to ExtUtils::Typemaps
    with full object-oriented goodness. [Steffen Mueller]

  - Check API compatibility when loading xs modules.
    If on a new-enough perl, add the XS_APIVERSION_BOOTCHECK macro to
    the _boot function of every XS module to compare it against the API
    version the module has been compiled against. If the versions do
    not match, an exception is thrown. [Florian Ragwitz]

  - Fixed compiler warnings in XS. [Zefram]

  - Spell-check [Peter J. Acklam]

2.2206 - Sun Jul  4 15:43:21 EDT 2010

 Bug fixes:

 - Make xsubpp accept the _ prototype (RT#57157) [Rafael Garcia-Suarez]

 - INCLUDE_COMMAND portability fixes for VMS (RT#58181) [Craig Berry]

 - INCLUDE_COMMAND fixes to detect non-zero exit codes (RT#52873)
   [Steffen Mueller]

2.2205 - Wed Mar 10 18:15:36 EST 2010

 Other:

 - No longer ships with Build.PL to avoid creating a circular dependency

2.2204 - Wed Mar 10 14:23:52 EST 2010

 Other:

 - Downgraded warnings on using INCLUDE with a command from "deprecated"
   to "discouraged" and limited it to the case where the command includes
   "perl" [Steffen Mueller]

2.2203 - Thu Feb 11 14:00:51 EST 2010

 Bug fixes:

 - Build.PL was not including ExtUtils/xsubpp for installation.  Fixed
   by subclassing M::B::find_pm_files to include it [David Golden]

2.2202 - Wed Jan 27 15:04:59 EST 2010

 Bug fixes:

 - The fix to IN/OUT/OUTLIST was itself broken and is now fixed.
   [Reported by Serdar Dalgic; fix suggested by Rafael Garcia-Suarez]

   We apologize for the fault in the regex. Those responsible 
   have been sacked.

2.2201 Mon Jan 25 16:12:05 EST 2010

 Bug fixes:

 - IN/OUT/OUTLIST, etc. were broken due to a bad regexp.  [Simon Cozens]

2.22 - Mon Jan 11 15:00:07 EST 2010

 No changes from 2.21_02

2.21_02 - Sat Dec 19 10:55:41 EST 2009

2.20_07 - Sat Oct  3 11:26:55 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:
 - Use "char* file" for perl < 5.9, not "char[] file"; fixes mod_perl
   breakage due to prior attempts to fix RT#48104 [David Golden]

2.20_06 - Fri Oct  2 23:45:45 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:
 - Added t/typemap to fix broken test on perl 5.6.2 [David Golden]
 - More prototype fixes for older perls [Goro Fuji]
 - Avoid "const char *" in test files as it breaks on 5.6.2 [Goro Fuji]

 Other:
 - Merged changes from 2.2004 maintenance branch (see 2.200401 to 2.200403)
   [David Golden]

2.20_05 - Sat Aug 22 21:46:56 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:
 - Fix prototype related bugs [Goro Fuji]
 - Fix the SCOPE keyword [Goro Fuji]

2.200403 - Fri Oct  2 02:01:58 EDT 2009

 Other:
 - Removed PERL_CORE specific @INC manipulation (no longer needed)
   [Nicholas Clark]
 - Changed hard-coded $^H manipulation in favor of "use re 'eval'"
   [Nicholas Clark]

2.200402 - Fri Oct  2 01:26:40 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:
 - UNITCHECK subroutines were not being called (detected in ext/XS-APItest
   in Perl blead) [reported by Jesse Vincent, patched by David Golden]

2.200401 - Mon Sep 14 22:26:03 EDT 2009

 - No changes from 2.20_04.


2.20_04 - Mon Aug 10 11:18:47 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:
 - Changed install_dirs to 'core' for 5.8.9 as well (RT#48474)
 - Removed t/bugs.t until there is better C++ support in ExtUtils::CBuilder

 Other:
 - Updated repository URL in META file

2.20_03 - Thu Jul 23 23:14:50 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:
 - Fixed "const char *" errors for 5.8.8 (and older) (RT#48104)
   [Vincent Pit]
 - Added newline before a preprocessor directive (RT#30673)
   [patch by hjp]

2.2002 - Sat Jul 18 17:22:27 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:
 - Fix Makefile.PL installdirs for older perls

2.20_01 - Wed Jul  8 12:12:47 EDT 2009

 - Fix XSUsage prototypes for testing [Jan Dubois]

2.20 - Wed Jul  1 13:42:11 EDT 2009

 - No changes from 2.19_04

2.19_04 - Mon Jun 29 11:49:12 EDT 2009

 - Changed tests to use Test::More and added it to prereqs

 - Some tests skip if no compiler or if no dynamic loading

 - INTERFACE keyword tests skipped for perl < 5.8

2.19_03 - Sat Jun 27 22:51:18 EDT 2009

 - Released to see updated results from smoke testers

 - Fix minor doc typo pulled from blead

2.19_02 - Wed Aug  6 22:18:33 2008

 - Fix the usage reports to consistently report package name as well
   as sub name across ALIAS, INTERFACE and regular XSUBS. [Robert May]

 - Cleaned up a warning with -Wwrite-strings that gets passed into
   every parsed XS file. [Steve Peters]

 - Allow (pedantically correct) C pre-processor comments in the code
   snippets of typemap files. [Nicholas Clark]

2.19 - Sun Feb 17 14:27:40 2008

 - Fixed the treatment of the OVERLOAD: keyword, which was causing a C
   compile error. [Toshiyuki Yamato]

2.18 - Mon Jan 29 20:56:36 2007

 - Added some UNITCHECK stuff, which (I think) makes XS code able to
   do UNITCHECK blocks. [Nicholas Clark]

 - Changed 'use re "eval";' to 'BEGIN { $^H |= 0x00200000 };' so we
   can compile re.xs in bleadperl. [Yves Orton]

 - Fix an undefined-variable warning related to 'inout' parameter
   processing.

2.17 - Mon Nov 20 17:07:27 2006

 - Stacked $filepathname to make #line directives in #INCLUDEs work.
   [Nicholas Clark]

 - Sprinked dVAR in with dXSARGS, for God-(Jarkko)-knows-what
   reason. [Jarkko Hietaniemi]

 - Use printf-style formats in Perl_croak() for some significant
   savings in number of distinct constant strings in the linked
   binaries we create. [Alexey Tourbin]

 - Don't use 'class' as a variable name in the t/XSTest.xs module,
   since that's a keyword in C++. [Jarkko Hietaniemi]

2.16  Fri Sep 15 22:33:24 CDT 2006

 - Fix a problem with PREFIX not working inside INTERFACE
   sections. [Salvador Fandin~o]

2.15  Mon Oct 10 11:02:13 EDT 2005

 - I accidentally left out a README from the distribution.  Now it's
   auto-created from the main documentation in ExtUtils/ParseXS.pm.

2.14  Sat Oct  8 21:49:15 EDT 2005

 - The filehandle for the .xs file was never being properly closed,
   and now it is.  This was causing some Win32 problems with
   Module::Build's tests, which create a .xs file, process it with
   ParseXS, and then try to remove it. [Spotted by Randy Sims]

2.13  Mon Oct  3 21:59:06 CDT 2005

 - Integrate a cleanup-related change from bleadperl that somehow
   never got into this copy. [Steve Hay]

2.12  Wed Aug 24 20:03:09 CDT 2005

 - On Win32, there was a DLL file we create during testing that we
   couldn't delete unless we closed it first, so testing failed when
   the deletion was attempted.  This should now work (provided the
   version of perl is high enough to have DynaLoader::dl_unload_file()
   - I'm not sure what will happen otherwise). [Steve Hay]

 - Fix a spurious warning during testing about a variable that's used
   before it's initialized. [Steve Hay]

2.11  Mon Jun 13 23:00:23 CDT 2005

 - Make some variables global, to avoid some "will not stay shared"
   warnings at compile time. [Rafael Garcia-Suarez]

2.10  Mon May 30 21:29:44 CDT 2005

 - This module is being integrated into the perl core; the regression
   tests will now work properly when run as part of the core build.
   [Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes]

 - Added the ability to create output files with a suffix other than
   ".c", via the new "csuffix" option.  This gets the module working
   on Symbian. [Jarkko Hietaniemi]

 - Added the ability to put 'extern "C"' declarations in front of
   prototypes. [Jarkko Hietaniemi]

2.09  Sun Mar 27 11:11:49 CST 2005

 - Integrated change #18270 from the perl core, which fixed a problem
   in which xsubpp can make nested comments in C code (which is
   bad). [Nicholas Clark]

 - When no "MODULE ... PACKAGE ... PREFIX" line is found, it's now
   still a fatal error for ParseXS, but we exit with status 0, which
   is what the old xsubpp did and seems to work best with some modules
   like Win32::NetAdmin.  See RT ticket 11472. [Steve Hay]

2.08  Fri Feb 20 21:41:22 CST 2004

 - Fixed a problem with backslashes in file paths (e.g. C:\Foo\Bar.xs)
   disappearing in error messages. [Randy Sims, Steve Hay]

 - Did a little minor internal code cleanup in the
   ExtUtils::ParseXS::CountLines class, now other classes don't poke
   around in its package variables.

2.07  Sun Jan 25 17:01:52 CST 2004

 - We now use ExtUtils::CBuilder for testing the compile/build phase
   in the regression tests.  It's not necessary to have it for runtime
   usage, though.

 - Fixed a minor documentation error (look in 'Changes' for revision
   history, not 'changes.pod'). [Scott R. Godin]

2.06  Fri Dec 26 09:00:47 CST 2003

 - Some fixes in the regression tests for the AIX platform.

2.05  Mon Sep 29 10:33:39 CDT 2003

 - We no longer trim the directory portions from the "#line " comments
   in the generated C code.  This helps cooperation with many editors'
   auto-jump-to-error stuff. [Ross McFarland]

 - In some cases the PERL_UNUSED_VAR macro is needed to get rid of C
   compile-time warnings in generated code.  Since this eliminates so
   many warnings, turning on "-Wall -W" (or your platform's
   equivalent) can once again be helpful. [Ross McFarland]

 - Did a huge amount of variable-scoping cleanup, and it *still*
   doesn't compile under 'use strict;'.  Much progress was made
   though, and many scoping issues were fixed.

2.04  Thu Sep  4 13:10:59 CDT 2003

 - Added a COPYRIGHT section to the documentation.  [Spotted by Ville
   Skytta]

2.03  Sat Aug 16 17:49:03 CST 2003

 - Fixed a warning that occurs if a regular expression (buried deep
   within the bowels of the code here) fails.  [Spotted by Michael
   Schwern]

 - Fixed a testing error on Cygwin. [Reini Urban]

2.02  Sun Mar 30 18:20:12 CST 2003

 - Now that we know this module doesn't work (yet?) with perl 5.005,
   put a couple 'use 5.006' statements in the module & Makefile.PL so
   we're explicit about the dependency. [Richard Clamp]

2.01  Thu Mar 20 08:22:36 CST 2003

 - Allow -C++ flag for backward compatibility.  It's a no-op, and has
   been since perl5.003_07. [PodMaster]

2.00  Sun Feb 23 16:40:17 CST 2003

 - Tests now function under all three of the supported compilers on
   Windows environments. [Randy W. Sims]

 - Will now install to the 'core' perl module directory instead of to
   'site_perl' or the like, because this is the only place MakeMaker
   will look for the xsubpp script.

 - Explicitly untie and close the output file handle because ParseXS was
   holding the file handle open, preventing the compiler from opening
   it on Win32. [Randy W. Sims]

 - Added an '--output FILENAME' flag to xsubpp and changed ParseXS to use
   the named file in the #line directives when the output file has an
   extension other than '.c' (i.e. '.cpp'). [Randy W. Sims]

 - Added conditional definition of the PERL_UNUSED_VAR macro to the
   output file in case it's not already defined for backwards
   compatibility with pre-5.8 versions of perl. (Not sure if this is the
   best solution.) [Randy W. Sims]


1.99  Wed Feb  5 10:07:47 PST 2003

 - Version bump to 1.99 so it doesn't look like a 'beta release' to
   CPAN.pm.  No code changes, since I haven't had any bug reports.

 - Fixed a minor problem in the regression tests that was creating an
   XSTest..o file instead of XSTest.o


1.98_01  Mon Dec  9 11:50:41 EST 2002

 - Converted from ExtUtils::xsubpp in bleadperl

 - Basic set of regression tests written
