         gateway host port bind retrans pingstring source_verify econnrefused
         IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU IPV6_RECVPATHMTU IPV6_HOPLIMIT
       - Added a dontfrag option, setting IP_DONTFRAG and on linux

         _pack_sockaddr_in and _unpack_sockaddr_in replacing sockaddr_in,

        Bugfixes
        - Stabilize tests
       Internals
        - wrap long pod lines
2.41  Mar 17 09:35 2013
        Bugfixes
        - Windows Vista does not appear to support inet_ntop().  It seems to
          have InetNtop() instead.  So, working around by using getnameinfo()
          and passing in the NI_NUMERICHOST to get an IP address.
        Features
        - Change Net::Ping to use Time::HiRes::time() instead of CORE::time()
          by default.  For most successful cases, CORE::time() returned zero. 
2.40  Mar 15 11:20 2013
        Bugfixes
        - several fixes to tests to stop the black smoke on Win32's 
          and Cygwin since the core updated the module to Test::More.
          I had planned a later release, but all the black smoke is
          forcing a release.
        - fixes to some skips in tests that were still using the 
          Test style skip's.
        - Documentation fix for https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48014.
          Thanks to Keith Taylor <keith@supanet.net.uk>
        - Instead of using a hard-coded TOS value, import IP_TOS from 
          Socket.  This fixes an outstanding bug on Solaris which uses a 
          different value for IP_TOS in it headers than Linux.  I'm assuming
          other OS's were fixed with this change as well.

        Features
        - added TTL handling for icmp pings to allow traceroute like 
          applications to be built with Net::Ping.  Thanks to 
          <rolek@bokxing.nl> for the patch and tests!

       Internals
        - replaced SOL_IP with IPPROTO_IP.  SOL_IP is not portable and was 
          hard-coded anyway.
        - added IPPROTO_IP, IP_TOS, IP_TTL, and AF_INET to the list of Socket 
          constants imported.
        - removed some hard-coded constants.
        - converted all calls to inet_ntoa() to inet_ntop() in preparation
          for further ipv6 updates.

        Infrastructure
        - Makefile.PL updated to require Test::More, Time::HiRes, and a
          recent Socket
        - several changes for github hosting
          - add a .gitignore file
          - added a .travis.yml file to allow CI testing with changes pushed
            to github
          - replaced the README with a README.md which displays the
            Travis CI build status on github.

	- skip test t/510_ping_udp.t on Windows Vista.  Thanks to Jan
	  Dubois for the code to test for Vista.
        - t/510_ping_udp.t should check for a udp echo port, not a tcp
	  echo port.

2.33  Jul 31 20:15 2007
	- add new method port_number() rather than asking users to
          twiddle with the internals of Net::Ping to probe a specific
          port.  This should resolve a few bugs where the documentation
	  was lacking.
	- apply patch from bergonz at labs.it.  This patch resolves
	  several problems logged regarding using Net::Ping in a multi-
	  threaded program.  Thanks so much!
