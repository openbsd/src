1.12  Mon May 16 23:36:07 2011
    - removed Normalize/CompExcl.pl and coded Composition Exclusions;
      how to load CompExcl.pl seems not good, but I'm not sure...

1.11  Sun May 15 20:31:09 2011
    - As perl 5.14.0 has removed unicore/CompositionExclusions.txt
      from the installation, Normalize/CompExcl.pl in this distribution
      is used instead. (see [rt.cpan.org #68106])

1.10  Sun Jan 16 21:00:34 2011
    - XSUB: reorder() and compose() treat with growing the string.
    - XSUB: provision against UTF8_ALLOW_* flags to be undefined in future.
    - doc: about perl 5.13.x and Unicode 6.0.0
    - doc and comments: [perl #81876] Fix typos by Peter J. Acklam.

    - doc: about perl 5.12.x and Unicode 5.2.0
    - test: prototype of normalize_partial() and cousins in proto.t.

1.06  Thu Feb 11 16:19:54 2010
    - mkheader/Pure Perl: fixed the internal _getHexArray() for perl 5.11.3
      changes (Bug #53197).

1.05  Mon Sep 28 21:43:17 2009
    - normalize_partial() and NFX_partial(). { NFX =~ /^NFK?[CD]\z/ }
    - added partial1.t for NFX_partial().
    - added partial2.t for normalize_partial().

1.04  Wed Sep 23 22:32:57 2009
    - doc: splitOnLastStarter() since 0.24 is now documented.
    - test: some new tests are added to split.t.

1.03  Sun Mar 29 12:56:23 2009
    - mkheader: check if no composition needs growing the string.
    - Makefile.PL: a tweak

1.02  Tue Jun  5 22:46:45 2007
    - XSUB: mkheader, _U_stringify() - avoid unpack('C*') on unicode.
    - test: short.t removed - pure perl is not appropriate for test of
            unicode edge cases.

1.01  Tue Jun 13 22:01:53 2006
    - XSUB: sv_setpvn() needs cast to (char*).
    - XSUB: avoid double FETCH for tied scalar variables.
    - added tie.t.

1.00  Thu May 25 20:35:06 2006
    - Pure Perl: compose($not_canonically_reordered) works like that in XSUB,
      where an intervening character with higher combining class blocks
      the composition. (This change doesn't affect any normalization forms.)
    - XSUB: NFD(), NFC(), NFKD(), NFC(), and FCC() are now in XSUB, then
      internal subroutine calls are avoided.
    - The functions isComp_Ex(), isNFD_NO(), isNFC_NO(), isNFC_MAYBE(),
      isNFKD_NO(), isNFKC_NO(), and isNFKC_MAYBE() are documented.
    - Tests are more amplified and documentations are more clarified.
    - Makefile.PL: Change 26295 is incorporated.

0.32  Tue Apr  5 22:47:09 2005
    - Some literal and grammatical errors in POD are fixed.

0.31  Tue Apr  5 21:43:20 2005
    - CAVEATS in POD is added.
    - Some test cases from Unicode Public Review Issue #29
      (Normalization Issue) are added to norm.t and test.t.
    - do 'mkheader' returns true so that Makefile.PL will catch error.
    - META.yml is added.

0.30  Sun May  2 14:35:00 2004
    - XSUB: (perl 5.8.1 or later) improved utf8 upgrade of non-POK
      (private POK) values like tied scalars, overloaded objects, etc.

0.28  Sat Nov 22 23:46:24 2003
    - XSUB: even if string contains a malformed, "short" Unicode character,
      decompose() and reorder() will be safe. Garbage will be no longer added.
    - added null.t and short.t.
    - now truly added illegal.t (in 0.27, forgot to change MANIFEST).

0.27  Sun Nov 16 13:16:21 2003
    - Illegal code points (surrogate and noncharacter) will be allowed
      (keep your code with <no warnings 'utf8';>);
      but porting is not successful in the case of ((Pure Perl) and
      (Perl 5.7.3 or before)).
    - added illegal.t.

0.26  Sat Nov 15 21:52:30 2003
    - doc fix: s/FCD(?= is unique)/FCC/;

0.25  Mon Oct  6 22:26:03 2003
    - added form.t and proto.t.

0.24  Sat Oct  4 17:57:10 2003
    - supports FCD and FCC (UTN #5):
      FCD(), normalize('FCD'), checkFCD(), check('FCD');
      FCC(), normalize('FCC'), checkFCC(), check('FCC').
    - changed INSTALLATION (cf. README).
      * Initial state of the distribution is changed to XSUB.  To build
        pure Perl, type <perl disableXS> before <perl Makefile.PL>.
      * The purePerl-XSUB converter is now provided as two perl
        script files, named "enableXS" and "disableXS".
        (no longer <perl Makefile.PL xs> and <perl Makefile.PL noxs>.)
      * simplified Makefile.PL.
    - added fcdc.t for FCD() and FCC().
    - added split.t for splitOnLastStarter(): an undocumented function.

0.23  Sat Jun 28 20:38:10 2003
    - bug fix: \0-terminate in compose() in XS.
    - tweak in pure perl: forced $codepoint to numeric (i.e. "+0065" to 65)
    - tweak of POD and README.

0.22  Mon Jun 09 22:23:10 2003
    - internal tweak (again): pack_U() and unpack_U().

    - internal tweak: for (?un)pack 'U'.
