DESCRIPTION
-----------

Compress-Raw-Bzip2 provides the interface to the bzip2 library for the modules
IO::Compress::Bzip2 and IO::Compress::Bunzip2.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before you can build Compress-Raw-Bzip2 you need to have the following
installed on your system:

    * A C compiler

    * Perl 5.004 or better. 

BUILDING THE MODULE
-------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, the module can now be built
using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

INSTALLATION
------------

To install Compress-Raw-Bzip2, run the command below:

    make install

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Solaris build fails with "language optional software package not installed"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are trying to build this module under Solaris and you get an
error message like this

    /usr/ucb/cc: language optional software package not installed

it means that Perl cannot find the C compiler on your system. The cryptic
message is just Sun's way of telling you that you haven't bought their
C compiler.

When you build a Perl module that needs a C compiler, the Perl build
system tries to use the same C compiler that was used to build perl
itself. In this case your Perl binary was built with a C compiler that
lived in /usr/ucb.

To continue with building this module, you need to get a C compiler,
or tell Perl where your C compiler is, if you already have one.

Assuming you have now got a C compiler, what you do next will be dependent
on what C compiler you have installed. If you have just installed Sun's
C compiler, you shouldn't have to do anything. Just try rebuilding
this module.

If you have installed another C compiler, say gcc, you have to tell perl
how to use it instead of /usr/ucb/cc.

This set of options seems to work if you want to use gcc. Your mileage
may vary.

    perl Makefile.PL CC=gcc CCCDLFLAGS=-fPIC OPTIMIZE=" "
    make test

If that doesn't work for you, it's time to make changes to the Makefile
by hand. Good luck!

Solaris build fails with "gcc: unrecognized option `-KPIC'"
-----------------------------------------------------------

You are running Solaris and you get an error like this when you try to
build this Perl module

    gcc: unrecognized option `-KPIC'

This symptom usually means that you are using a Perl binary that has been
built with the Sun C compiler, but you are using gcc to build this module.

When Perl builds modules that need a C compiler, it will attempt to use
the same C compiler and command line options that was used to build perl
itself. In this case "-KPIC" is a valid option for the Sun C compiler,
but not for gcc. The equivalent option for gcc is "-fPIC".

The solution is either:

    1. Build both Perl and this module with the same C compiler, either
       by using the Sun C compiler for both or gcc for both.

    2. Try generating the Makefile for this module like this perl

           perl Makefile.PL CC=gcc CCCDLFLAGS=-fPIC OPTIMIZE=" " LD=gcc
           make test

       This second option seems to work when mixing a Perl binary built
       with the Sun C compiler and this module built with gcc. Your
       mileage may vary.

HP-UX Notes
-----------

I've had a report that when building Compress-Raw-Bzip2 under HP-UX that it
is necessary to have first built the bzip2 library with the -fpic
option.

FEEDBACK
--------

How to report a problem with Compress-Raw-Bzip2.

To help me help you, I need all of the following information:

 1. The Versions of everything relevant.
    This includes:

     a. The *complete* output from running this
     
            perl -V
     
        Do not edit the output in any way.
        Note, I want you to run "perl -V" and NOT "perl -v".
     
        If your perl does not understand the "-V" option it is too
        old. This module needs Perl version 5.004 or better.     

     b. The version of Compress-Raw-Bzip2 you have. 
        If you have successfully installed Compress-Raw-Bzip2, this one-liner
        will tell you:

           perl -MCompress::Raw::Bzip2 -e 'print qq[ver $Compress::Raw::Bzip2::VERSION\n]'

        If you are  running windows use this

           perl -MCompress::Raw::Bzip2 -e "print qq[ver $Compress::Raw::Bzip2::VERSION\n]"

        If you haven't installed Compress-Raw-Bzip2 then search Compress::Raw::Bzip2.pm
        for a line like this:

          $VERSION = "2.024" ;

     c. The version of bzip2 you have used.
        If you have successfully installed Compress-Raw-Bzip2, this one-liner
        will tell you:

          perl -MCompress::Raw::Bzip2 -e "print q[bzip2 ver ]. Compress::Raw::Bzip2::ZLIB_VERSION.qq[\n]" 

        If not, look at the beginning of the file zlib.h. 

 2. If you are having problems building Compress-Raw-Bzip2, send me a
    complete log of what happened. Start by unpacking the Compress-Raw-Bzip2
    module into a fresh directory and keep a log of all the steps

        [edit config.in, if necessary]
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
