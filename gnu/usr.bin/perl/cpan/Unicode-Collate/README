Unicode/Collate version 0.97
===============================

NAME

  Unicode::Collate - Unicode Collation Algorithm

SYNOPSIS

  use Unicode::Collate;

  #construct
  $Collator = Unicode::Collate->new(%tailoring);

  #sort
  @sorted = $Collator->sort(@not_sorted);

  #compare
  $result = $Collator->cmp($a, $b); # returns 1, 0, or -1.
  $result = $Collator->eq($a, $b);  # returns true/false
    (similarly ->ne, ->lt, ->le, ->gt, ->ge)

Note: Strings in @not_sorted, $a and $b are interpreted
according to Perl's Unicode support. See perlunicode,
perluniintro, perlunitut, perlunifaq, utf8.
Otherwise you can use "preprocess" or should decode them before.

INSTALL

  Perl 5.6.1 or later is required.
  Perl 5.8.1 or later is recommended.

  Though this distribution contains a subset of an old DUCET, named
  "keys.txt", this one is intended only for doing a test of this module
  and practically useless for any other purpose.

  Installation of Unicode::Collate::Locale requires Collate/Locale.pm,
  Collate/Locale/*.pm, Collate/CJK/*.pm and Collate/allkeys.txt.
  On building, Unicode::Collate::Locale doesn't require any of data/*.txt,
  gendata/*, and mklocale.
  Tests for Unicode::Collate::Locale are named t/loc_*.t.

Since 0.54, XSUB that requires a C compiler will be built by default.
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Even if a C compiler is not available, pure Perl (i.e. non-XS) edition
is available; type the following:

   perl disableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you decide to install XSUB edition after trying to build pure Perl,
type the following:

   make clean
   perl enableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

  The conformant collation requires Unicode::Normalize (v 0.10 or later)
  although Unicode::Collate can be used without Unicode::Normalize.

ABOUT DUCET

  Though this module can be used without any C<table> file,
  to use this module easily, it is recommended to install a table file
  in the UCA format, by copying it under the directory
  <a place in @INC>/Unicode/Collate.

  You can install such a table file by adding it to "Collate" directory
  (where "keys.txt" is placed) in this distribution before executing
  Makefile.PL.

  The most preferable one is "The Default Unicode Collation Element Table"
  (aka DUCET), available from the Unicode Consortium's website:

   http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/

   http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/latest/allkeys.txt (latest version)

  If DUCET is not installed, it is recommended to copy the file
  from http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/latest/allkeys.txt
  to <a place in @INC>/Unicode/Collate/allkeys.txt manually.

HOW TO CHANGE DUCET (NOT WARRANTED)

  0. rewriting UCA_Version and Base_Unicode_Version in Collate.pm
     and t/version.t is preferred.
  1. replace Collate/allkeys.txt with a new DUCET.
  2. run mklocale to generate new Locale/*.pl and Korean.pm.
  3. replace Collate/Locale/*.pl with the new Locale/*.pl,
     and Collate/CJK/Korean.pm with the new Korean.pm.
  4. make test.
     IF FAIL, it may require more changes, not be easy.
