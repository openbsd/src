=head1 NAME

Test2::Formatter - Namespace for formatters.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the namespace for formatters. This is an empty package.

=head1 CREATING FORMATTERS

A formatter is any package or object with a C<write($event, $num)> method.

    package Test2::Formatter::Foo;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    sub write {
        my $self_or_class = shift;
        my ($event, $assert_num) = @_;
        ...
    }

    sub hide_buffered { 1 }

    sub terminate { }

    sub finalize { }

    sub new_root {
        my $class = shift;
        ...
        $class->new(@_);
    }

    1;

The C<write> method is a method, so it either gets a class or instance. The two
arguments are the C<$event> object it should record, and the C<$assert_num>
which is the number of the current assertion (ok), or the last assertion if
this event is not itself an assertion. The assertion number may be any integer 0
or greater, and may be undefined in some cases.

The C<hide_buffered()> method must return a boolean. This is used to tell
buffered subtests whether or not to send it events as they are being buffered.
See L<Test2::API/"run_subtest(...)"> for more information.

The C<terminate> and C<finalize> methods are optional methods called that you
can implement if the format you're generating needs to handle these cases, for
example if you are generating XML and need close open tags.

The C<terminate> method is called when an event's C<terminate> method returns
true, for example when a L<Test2::Event::Plan> has a C<'skip_all'> plan, or
when a L<Test2::Event::Bail> event is sent. The C<terminate> method is passed
a single argument, the L<Test2::Event> object which triggered the terminate.

The C<finalize> method is always the last thing called on the formatter, I<<
except when C<terminate> is called for a Bail event >>. It is passed the
following arguments:

The C<new_root> method is called when C<Test2::API::Stack> Initializes the root
hub for the first time. Most formatters will simply have this call C<<
$class->new >>, which is the default behavior. Some formatters however may want
to take extra action during construction of the root formatter, this is where
they can do that.
