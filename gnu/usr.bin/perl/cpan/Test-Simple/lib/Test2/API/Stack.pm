=head1 NAME

Test2::API::Stack - Object to manage a stack of L<Test2::Hub>
instances.

=head1 ***INTERNALS NOTE***

B<The internals of this package are subject to change at any time!> The public
methods provided will not change in backwards incompatible ways, but the
underlying implementation details might. B<Do not break encapsulation here!>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used to represent and manage a stack of L<Test2::Hub>
objects. Hubs are usually in a stack so that you can push a new hub into place
that can intercept and handle events differently than the primary hub.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $stack = Test2::API::Stack->new;
    my $hub = $stack->top;

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $stack = Test2::API::Stack->new()

This will create a new empty stack instance. All arguments are ignored.

=item $hub = $stack->new_hub()

=item $hub = $stack->new_hub(%params)

=item $hub = $stack->new_hub(%params, class => $class)

This will generate a new hub and push it to the top of the stack. Optionally
you can provide arguments that will be passed into the constructor for the
L<Test2::Hub> object.

If you specify the C<< 'class' => $class >> argument, the new hub will be an
instance of the specified class.

Unless your parameters specify C<'formatter'> or C<'ipc'> arguments, the
formatter and IPC instance will be inherited from the current top hub. You can
set the parameters to C<undef> to avoid having a formatter or IPC instance.

If there is no top hub, and you do not ask to leave IPC and formatter undef,
then a new formatter will be created, and the IPC instance from
L<Test2::API> will be used.

=item $hub = $stack->top()

This will return the top hub from the stack. If there is no top hub yet this
will create it.

=item $hub = $stack->peek()

This will return the top hub from the stack. If there is no top hub yet this
will return undef.

=item $stack->cull

This will call C<< $hub->cull >> on all hubs in the stack.

=item @hubs = $stack->all

This will return all the hubs in the stack as a list.

=item $stack->clear

This will completely remove all hubs from the stack. Normally you do not want
to do this, but there are a few valid reasons for it.

=item $stack->push($hub)

This will push the new hub onto the stack.

=item $stack->pop($hub)

This will pop a hub from the stack, if the hub at the top of the stack does not
match the hub you expect (passed in as an argument) it will throw an exception.
