=head1 NAME

Test2::EventFacet::Render - Facet that dictates how to render an event.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This facet is used to dictate how the event should be rendered by the standard
test2 rendering tools. If this facet is present then ONLY what is specified by
it will be rendered. It is assumed that anything important or note-worthy will
be present here, no other facets will be considered for rendering/display.

This facet is a list type, you can add as many items as needed.

=head1 FIELDS

=item $string = $render->[#]->{details}

=item $string = $render->[#]->details()

Human readable text for display.

=item $string = $render->[#]->{tag}

=item $string = $render->[#]->tag()

Tag that should prefix/identify the main text.

=item $string = $render->[#]->{facet}

=item $string = $render->[#]->facet()

Optional, if the display text was generated from another facet this should
state what facet it was.

=item $mode = $render->[#]->mode{}

=item $mode = $render->[#]->mode()

=item calculated

Calculated means the facet was generated from another facet. Calculated facets
may be cleared and regenerated whenever the event state changes.

event.
