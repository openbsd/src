=over 4

=item $string = $amnesty->{details}

=item $string = $amnesty->details()

Human readable explanation of why amnesty was granted.

Example: I<Not implemented yet, will fix>

=item $short_string = $amnesty->{tag}

=item $short_string = $amnesty->tag()

Short string (usually 10 characters or less, not enforced, but may be truncated
by renderers) categorizing the amnesty.

=item $bool = $amnesty->{inherited}

=item $bool = $amnesty->inherited()

This will be true if the amnesty was granted to a parent event and inherited by
this event, which is a child, such as an assertion within a subtest that is
marked todo.
