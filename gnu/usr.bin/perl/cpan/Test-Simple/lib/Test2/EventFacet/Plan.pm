=head1 NAME

Test2::EventFacet::Plan - Facet for setting the plan

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Events use this facet when they need to set the plan.

=head1 FIELDS

=over 4

=item $string = $plan->{details}

=item $string = $plan->details()

Human readable explanation for the plan being set. This is normally not
rendered by most formatters except when the C<skip> field is also set.

=item $positive_int = $plan->{count}

=item $positive_int = $plan->count()

Set the number of expected assertions. This should usually be set to C<0> when
C<skip> or C<none> are also set.

=item $bool = $plan->{skip}

=item $bool = $plan->skip()

When true the entire test should be skipped. This is usually paired with an
explanation in the C<details> field, and a C<control> facet that has
C<terminate> set to C<0>.

=item $bool = $plan->{none}

=item $bool = $plan->none()

This is mainly used by legacy L<Test::Builder> tests which set the plan to C<no
plan>, a construct that predates the much better C<done_testing()>.

If you are using this in non-legacy code you may need to reconsider the course
of your life, maybe a hermitage would suite you?
