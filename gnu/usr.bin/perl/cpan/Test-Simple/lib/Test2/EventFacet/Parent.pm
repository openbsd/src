=head1 FIELDS

=over 4

=item $string = $parent->{details}

=item $string = $parent->details()

Human readable description of the event.

=item $hid = $parent->{hid}

=item $hid = $parent->hid()

Hub ID of the hub that is represented in the parent-child relationship.

=item $arrayref = $parent->{children}

=item $arrayref = $parent->children()

Arrayref containing the facet-data hashes of events nested under this one.

I<To get the actual events you need to get them from the parent event directly>

=item $bool = $parent->{buffered}

=item $bool = $parent->buffered()

True if the subtest is buffered (meaning the formatter has probably not seen
them yet).
