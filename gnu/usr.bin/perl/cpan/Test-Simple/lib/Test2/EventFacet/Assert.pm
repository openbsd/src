Human readable description of the assertion.

=item $bool = $assert->{pass}

=item $bool = $assert->pass()

True if the assertion passed.

=item $bool = $assert->{no_debug}

Set this to true if you have provided custom diagnostics and do not want the
defaults to be displayed.

=item $int = $assert->{number}

=item $int = $assert->number()

(Optional) assertion number. This may be omitted or ignored. This is usually
