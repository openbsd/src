    [ENHANCEMENTS]

    - Generates META.json and MYMETA.json consistent with version 2 of the
      CPAN Meta Spec. [David Golden]

  Also in this release:

  [BUG FIXES]

  - Autogenerated documentation no longer includes private actions from
    Module::Build's own release subclass. [Report by Timothy Appnel,
    fix by David Golden]

0.37_06 - Mon Feb 28 21:43:31 EST 2011

  [BUG FIXES]

  - prerequisites with the empty string instead of a version are
    normalized to "0".  (RT#65909)

  [OTHER]

  - More Pod typo/link fixes [Hongwen Qiu]

0.37_05 - Sat Feb 19 20:43:23 EST 2011

  [BUG FIXES]

  - fixes failing ppm.t in perl core

  [OTHER]

  - Pod typo fixes [Hongwen Qiu]

0.37_04 - Wed Feb 16 15:27:21 EST 2011

  [OTHER]

  - moved scripts/ to bin/ for less confusing porting to bleadperl

0.37_03 - Wed Feb 16 09:54:05 EST 2011

  [BUG FIXES]

  - removed an irrelevant test in t/actions/installdeps.t that was causing
    failures on some Cygwin platforms

  [OTHER]

  - dropped configure_requires as some CPAN clients apparently get
    confused by having things in both configure_requires and requires

  - bumped Parse::CPAN::Meta build prereq to 1.4401

  - bumped CPAN::Meta prereq to 2.110420

  - Pod typo fixes [Hongwen Qiu]

0.37_02 - Mon Feb  7 21:05:30 EST 2011

  [BUG FIXES]

  - bumped CPAN::Meta prereq to 2.110390 to avoid a regression in 2.110360

0.37_01 - Thu Feb  3 03:44:38 EST 2011

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - Generates META.json and MYMETA.json consistent with version 2 of the
    CPAN Meta Spec. [David Golden]

  [BUG FIXES]

  - t/signature.t now uses a mocked Module::Signature; this should be
    more robust across platforms as it only needs to confirm that
    Module::Build is calling Module::Signature when expected

  [OTHER]

  - Added CPAN::Meta and Parse::CPAN::Meta to prerequisites and dropped
    CPAN::Meta::YAML

0.3624 - Thu Jan 27 11:38:39 EST 2011

  - Fixed pod2html directory bugs and fixed creation of spurious blib
    directory in core perl directory when running install.t (RT#63003)
    [Chris Williams]

0.3623 - Wed Jan 26 17:45:30 EST 2011

  - Fixed bugs involving bootstrapping configure_requires prerequisites
    on older CPANPLUS clients or for either CPAN/CPANPLUS when using
    the compatibility Makefile.PL

  - Added diagnostic output when configure_requires are missing for
    the benefit of users doing manual installation

0.3622 - Mon Jan 24 21:06:50 EST 2011

  - No changes from 0.36_21

0.36_21 - Fri Jan 21 11:01:28 EST 2011

  - Changed YAML::Tiny references to the new CPAN::Meta::YAML module
    instead, which is the YAML-variant that is going into the Perl core

0.36_20 - Fri Dec 10 15:36:03 EST 2010

  *** DEPRECATIONS ***

  - Module::Build::Version has been deprecated.  Module::Build now depends
    directly upon version.pm.  A pure-perl version has been bundled in inc/
    solely for bootstrapping in case configure_requires is not supported.
    M::B::Version remains as a wrapper around version.pm.

  - Module::Build::ModuleInfo has been deprecated.  Module::Build now
    depends directly upon Module::Metadata (which is an extraction of
    M::B::ModuleInfo intended for general reuse).  A pure-perl version has
    been bundled in inc/ solely for bootstrapping in case
    configure_requires is not supported. M::B::ModuleInfo remains as a
    wrapper around Module::Metadata.

  - Module::Build::YAML has been deprecated.  Module::Build now depends
    directly upon YAML::Tiny.  M::B::YAML remains as a subclass wrapper.
    The YAML_support feature has been removed, as YAML is now an ordinary
    dependency.

0.36_19 - Tue Dec  7 13:43:42 EST 2010

  Bug fixes:

  - Perl::OSType is declared as a 'configure_requires' dependency, but is
    also bundled in inc (and loaded if needed) [David Golden]

0.36_18 - Mon Dec  6 16:46:49 EST 2010

  Changes:

  - Added dependency on Perl::OSType to refactor and centralize
    management of OS type mapping [David Golden]

  - When parsing a version number out of a file, any trailing alphabetical
    characters will be dropped to avoid fatal errors when comparing version
    numbers.  These would have been dropped (with a warning) anyway during
    an ordinary numeric comparison. (RT#56071) [David Golden]

  Bug fixes:

  - A Perl interpreter mismatch between running Build.PL and running Build
    is now a fatal error, not a warning (RT#55183) [David Golden]

  - Bundled Module::Build::Version updated to bring into sync with CPAN
    version.pm 0.86 [David Golden]

  - No longer uses fake user 'foo' in t/tilde (RT#61793) [David Golden]

  - Won't fail tests if an ancient Tie::IxHash is installed
    [Christopher J. Madsen]

  - Correctly report missing metafile field names [David Golden]

  - Suppress uninitialized value errors during Pod creation
    on ActiveState Perl [David Golden]

  - Return to starting directory after install action; this is
    an attempt to fix an install.t heisenbug (RT#63003) [David Golden]

  - A broken version.pm load won't cause Module::Build::Version to
    die trying to install itself as a mock version (RT#59499)
    [Eric Wilhelm and David Golden]

  - PERL_DL_NONLAZY is now always set when tests are run
    (RT#56055) [Dmitry Karasik]

  - 'fakeinstall' will use .modulebuildrc actions for 'install' if
    no specific 'fakeinstall' options are provided (RT#57279)
    [David Golden]

  - Add install*script to search path for installdeps client
    and search site, then vendor, then core paths

  - Skip noexec tmpdir check on Windows (RT#55667) [Jan Dubois]

  - Arguments with key value pairs may now have keys with "-" in them
    (RT#53050) [David Golden]

  - Add quotemeta to t/tilde.t test to fix Cygwin fails
    [Chris Williams and David Golden]

  - Build script now checks that M::B is at least the same version
    of M::B as provided in 'configure_requires' in META
    (RT#54954) [David Golden]

0.36_17 - Wed Oct 27 18:08:36 EDT 2010

  Enhancements:

  - Added 'distinstall' action to run 'Build install' inside the
    generated distribution directory [Jeff Thalhammer]

0.36_16 - Thu Aug 26 12:44:07 EDT 2010

  Bug fixes:

  - Better error message in case package declaration is not found
    when searching for version. [Alexandr Ciornii]

  - Skips 'release_status' tests on perl < 5.8.1 due to buggy
    treatment of dotted-decimal version numbers [David Golden]

0.36_15 - Wed Aug 25 10:41:28 EDT 2010

  Bug fixes:

  - Added a mock Software::License to prevent t/properties/license.t
    from failing.

0.36_14 - Sun Aug 22 22:56:50 EDT 2010

  Enhancements:

  - Adds 'release_status' and 'dist_suffix' properties in preparation
    for adding CPAN Meta Spec 2 support.  'dist_suffix' will be set
    to 'TRIAL' automatically when necessary. [David Golden]

  - Makes 'license' more liberal.  You can now specify either a license
    key from the approved list (c.f. Module::Build::API) or just a
    Software::License subclass name (e.g. 'Perl_5').  This should
    provide better support for custom or proprietary licenses.
    [David Golden]

0.36_13 - Wed Jul 28 22:40:25 EDT 2010

 Bug-fixes:

 - Bundled Module::Build::Version updated to bring into sync with CPAN
   version.pm 0.82 [David Golden]

0.36_12 - Tue Jul 27 00:08:51 EDT 2010

  Enhancements:

  - Module::Build::Compat will now convert dotted-decimal prereqs into
    decimal rather than dying (and will warn about this). [Apocalypse]

  Bug fixes:

  - Caches case-sensitivity checks to boost performance, fixes 
    RT#55162 and RT#56513 [Reini Urban]

  - Won't try to use ActivePerl doc generation tools without confirming
    that they are indeed installed. [David Golden]

  - Sets temporary $ENV{HOME} in testing to an absolute path, which fixes
    some issues when tested as part of the Perl core [Nicholas Clark]

  - Module::Build::ModuleInfo now warns instead of dying when a module
    has an invalid version.  ->version now just returns undef
    (RT#59593) [David Golden]

  Changes:

  - When authors do not specify Module::Build in configure_requires and
    Module::Build is automatically added, a warning will be issued
    showing the added prerequisite [David Golden]

  - Moved automatic configure_requires generation into get_metadata()
    and added an 'auto' argument to toggle it (on for META and off
    for MYMETA) [David Golden]

0.36_11 - Thu May 27 09:41:23 EDT 2010

  Bug fixes:

  - Handle META/MYMETA reading and writing within Module::Build to ensure
    utf8 mode on filehandles.  Now passes/gets only strings to YAML::Tiny
    or Module::Build::YAML

0.36_10 - Wed May 19 18:36:06 EDT 2010

  Bug fixes:

  - Fix failing t/manifypods.t on Windows from 0.36_09 changes [Klaus
    Eichner]

0.36_09 - Tue May 11 09:19:12 EDT 2010

  Bug fixes:

  - Improve HTML documentation generation on ActivePerl (RT#53478)
    [Scott Renner and Klaus Eichner]

0.36_08 - Mon Apr 26 08:00:15 EDT 2010

 Enhancements:

 - Give a list of valid licenses when given one we don't recognize
   (RT#55951) [Yanick Champoux]

 - Added 'Build manifest_skip' action to generate a default MANIFEST.SKIP
   [David Golden]

 Changes:

 - When temporarily generating a MANIFEST.SKIP when none exists, it will
   be removed on exit instead of hanging around until 'Build clean'.  This
   is less surprising/confusing and the 'Build manifest_skip' action
   is now available instead to bootstrap the file [David Golden]

 Bug fixes:

 - Fixed runtime error on cygwin when searching for an executable command
   during installdeps testing [David Golden]

0.3607 - Thu Apr  1 11:27:16 EDT 2010

 Bug fixes:

 - The 'dist' action now always ensures a clean dist directory before
   creating the tarball [David Golden]

0.36_06 - Thu Apr  1 01:23:58 EDT 2010

 Other:

 - Migrated repository to git and updated META.yml to match

 - Removed bugtracker URL (let search.cpan.org use default)

 - Disabled SIGNATURE generation

0.3605 - Wed Mar 31 12:05:11 EDT 2010

 - No changes from 0.36_04

0.36_04 - Tue Mar 16 21:41:41 EDT 2010

 Bug fixes:

 - Added missing newline to "Changing sharpbang" messages under verbose
   output (RT#54474) [David Golden]

 - Added 'beos' to list of Unix-like os types (RT#53876) [Nigel Horne]

 - Sets $ENV{HOME} to a temporary directory during testing [David Golden]

 - For VMS: fixed prefix handling plus other test fixes [Craig Berry]

 - Support anonymous array of directories for c_source [Alberto Simões]

 - Small POD formatting fix [James Keenan]

0.3603 - Mon Jan 18 22:28:59 EST 2010

(Oops, I released the last one before I realized this should have been
fixed along with it.)

 Bug fixes:

 - Module::Build::Compat would croak on distibutions that set requires
   'perl' to a dotted decimal like '5.6.2'.  We now skip that key
   since it doesn't go into PREREQ_PM and we numify it properly for
   'use 5.006002' in the generated Makefile.PL (RT#53409)
   [David Golden, adapted from patch by G. Allen Morris III]

0.3602 - Mon Jan 18 22:09:54 EST 2010

 Bug fixes:

 - Fix failures in t/properties/needs_compiler.t when $ENV{CC} is set
   (RT#53296) [David Golden, adapted from patch by Jens Rehsack]

0.3601 - Mon Dec 21 14:39:33 EST 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - When the currently running Module::Build is not the same as the one
   that created the Build file, there is now a warning rather than a fatal
   error.  This helps installation of dependency chains where a dependency
   might configure_requires a new Module::Build after Build.PL was already
   run for an earlier distribution. [David Golden, on advice of Matt Trout]

 Other:

 - t/bundle_inc.t fails in odd ways.  This test of an experimental feature
   should not prevent users from installing Module::Build, so this test
   now skips unless $ENV{MB_TEST_EXPERIMENTAL} is true

0.36 - Sun Dec 20 15:02:38 EST 2009

No changes from 0.35_15 other than the version number.

Summary of major changes since 0.35:

 Enhancements:

 - Added 'Build installdeps' action to install needed dependencies via
   a user-configurable command line program.  (Defaults to 'cpan'.)

 - Command line options may be set via the PERL_MB_OPT environment
   variable (similar to PERL_MM_OPT in ExtUtils::MakeMaker)

 - Generates MYMETA.yml during Build.PL (new standard protocol for
   communicating configuration results between toolchain components)

 - Reduced amount of console output under normal operation (use --verbose
   to see all output)

 - Added experimental inc/ bundling; see Module::Build::Bundling for
   details.

 New or changed properties:

 - Added 'share_dir' property to provide File::ShareDir support;
   File::ShareDir automatically added to 'requires' if 'share_dir' is set

 - Added 'needs_compiler' property.  Defaults to true if XS or c_source
   exist.  If true, ExtUtils::CBuilder is also added to build_requires.

 - 'C_support' is no longer an optional feature.  Modern ExtUtils::CBuilder
   and ExtUtils::ParseXS added to the 'requires' list.  This ensures that
   upgrading Module::Build will upgrade these critical modules.

 - Clarified that 'apache' in the license attribute indicates the Apache
   License 2.0 and added 'apache_1_1' for the older version of the license
   (RT#50614)

 Deprecations:

 - Module::Build::Compat 'passthrough' style has been deprecated.  Using
   'passthrough' will issue warnings on Makefile.PL generation.  See
   Module::Build::Compat documentation for rationale.

 Internals:

 - Replaced use of YAML.pm with YAML::Tiny; Module::Build::YAML is now
   based on YAML::Tiny as well

 - A new get_metadata() method has been added as a simpler wrapper around
   the old, kludgy prepare_metadata() API.

 - Replaced guts of new_from_context().  Build.PL is now executed in a
   separate process before resume() is called.  (This is generally only of
   interest to Module::Build or toolchain developers) (RT#49350)

 - Add support for 'package NAME VERSION' syntax added in Perl 5.11.1

 Notable bug fixes:

 - The "test" action now dies when using the 'use_tap_harness'
   option and tests fail, matching the behavior under Test::Harness.
   (RT#49080) [initial patch from David Wheeler; revised by David Golden]

 - Updated PPM generation to PPM v4 (RT#49600) [Olivier Mengue]

 - When module_name is not supplied, no packlist was being written; fixed
   by guessing module_name from dist_version_from or the directory name
   (just like ExtUtils::Manifest does without NAME) [David Golden]

 - Failure to detect a compiler will now warn during Build.PL and be a
   fatal error when trying to compile during Build. (RT#48918) [David
   Golden]

 - Auto-detection of abstract and author fixed for mixed-case POD headers
   (RT#51117) [David Wheeler]

 - resume() was not restoring additions to @INC added in Build.PL
   (RT#50145) [David Golden]

 - When tarball paths are less than 100 characters, disables 'prefix'
   mode of Archive::Tar for maximum compatibility (RT#50571) [David Golden]

 - Merging 'requires' and 'build_requires' in Module::Build::Compat could
   lead to duplicate PREREQ_PM entries; now the highest version is used
   for PREREQ_PM. (RT#50948) [David Golden]

 - Module::Build::Compat will now die with an error if advanced,
   non-numeric prerequisites are given, as these are not supported by
   ExtUtils::MakeMaker in PREREQ_PM [David Golden]


0.35_15 - Thu Dec 17 17:51:22 EST 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - Make sure PPM tests are skipped if IO::File is too old [David Golden]

0.35_14 - Thu Dec 17 16:02:14 EST 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - If not set, the 'module_name' is detected from 'dist_version_from'
   or from 'dist_name'.  The directory is no longer used. [David Golden]

 - The 'share_dir' property no longer defaults to 'share' and must be
   explicitly set instead; this fixes problems for CPAN distributions that
   already have a 'share' directory for whatever reason [David Golden]

 - Change t/00-compile.t test for more portability [David Golden]

 - Skip ppm.t if Pod::Html is not available [David Goldenj]

 - Changed guts of inc::latest to work properly on older versions of Perl
   [David Golden]

 - Ensure bundle_inc.t doesn't accidentally uninstall the installed M::B
   during testing if the user had 'uninst=1' set during Build.PL
   [David Golden]

0.35_13 - Sat Dec  5 11:26:36 EST 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - Protect against tempfile errors when checking ExtUtils::Installed
   [David Golden]

0.35_12 - Fri Dec  4 23:06:49 EST 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - Protect inc/ bundling tests against broken ExtUtils::Installed
   [David Golden]

0.35_11 - Thu Dec  3 11:07:44 EST 2009

 *** API CHANGE ***

 - The old API for prepare_metadata() has been restored to avoid breaking
   distributions that were overriding it (e.g. BioPerl), but the method
   has been marked deprecated and may be made private or may disappear in
   some future version of Module::Build. [David Golden]

 - A new get_metadata() method has been added as a simpler wrapper around
   the old, kludgy prepare_metadata() API. [David Golden]

0.35_10 - Tue Nov 24 22:49:19 EST 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - bundle_inc.t is more careful about permissions and open filehandles
   to avoid failures/skips on Win32 [David Golden]

 - Fix compilation error in Module::Build::Platform::VMS (RT#51766)
   [David Golden]

 - Don't generate a MANIFEST.SKIP during distclean and add any generated
   MANIFEST.SKIP to cleanup list [reported by Zefram, fixed by David Golden]

 - Module::Build::ModuleInfo version parsing would fail if a module sets
   its $VERSION from another module, but the other module is not installed.
   We now try to detect such failures, prepend 'lib' to @INC and try again.
   [David Golden]

 - MYMETA.yml used to be generated from scratch, overriding any
   customizations used to create META.yml.  Now, if META.yml exists, that
   will be used as the base for MYMETA and only prereq fields will be
   updated (to reflect any dynamic configuration); also, 'dynamic_config'
   will be set to false and 'generated_by' will be updated [David Golden]

0.35_09 - Thu Nov 19 01:30:42 EST 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - The DB package should not be included in 'provides' in META files
   [David Golden]

 - Fixed t/xs.t build failures in bleadperl for noexec temp directories
   [Nicholas Clark]

 - Adjusted order of @INC in resume() (fixes par.t, ppm.t, xs.t fails):
   @INC = @new_additions_to_inc, @saved_additions_to_inc, @default_inc
   [David Golden]

 - Skip bundle_inc.t tests if bundled Module::Build for test can't be
   tweaked (Works around test crashes on Win2) [David Golden]

 Other:

 - 'C_support' is no longer an optional feature.  Modern ExtUtils::CBuilder
   and ExtUtils::ParseXS added to the 'requires' list.  This ensures that
   upgrading Module::Build will upgrade this critical modules.
   ExtUtils::CBuilder no longer requires a compiler, so it is "safe" to
   require.

0.35_08 - Mon Nov 16 22:38:28 EST 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - Multiple tests were failing due to dependency problems.  Author
   dependencies have been largely removed from core 'requires' into
   optional features.  Feature prereq detection and messaging have been
   expanded and bugs on older Perls have been removed.

0.35_07 - Sat Nov 14 17:14:39 EST 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - Auto-detection of abstract and author fixed for mixed-case POD headers
   (RT#51117) [David Wheeler]

 - resume() was not restoring additions to @INC added in Build.PL
   (RT#50145) [David Golden]

 - When tarball paths are less than 100 characters, disables 'prefix'
   mode of Archive::Tar for maximum compatibility (RT#50571) [David Golden]

0.35_06 - Fri Nov 13 14:51:28 EST 2009

 Enhancements:

 - Added experimental inc/ bundling; see Module::Build::Bundling for
   details.  [David Golden and Eric Wilhelm]

 - Clarified that 'apache' in the license attribute indicates the Apache
   License 2.0 and added 'apache_1_1' for the older version of the license
   (RT#50614) [David Golden]

 Bug fixes:

 - Merging 'requires' and 'build_requires' in Module::Build::Compat could
   lead to duplicate PREREQ_PM entries; now the highest version is used
   for PREREQ_PM. (RT#50948) [David Golden]

 - Module::Build::Compat will now die with an error if advanced,
   non-numeric prerequisites are given, as these are not supported by
   ExtUtils::MakeMaker in PREREQ_PM [David Golden]

 - Made MYMETA generation non-fatal if fields required for META.yml
   are missing [David Golden]

 - Added Pod::Simple to requirements for manpage support; avoids
   problems if a user has a broken Pod::Man/Pod::Simple.  (RT#50081)
   [David Golden]

 - Won't die if installed Pod::Readme is broken [David Golden]

 Other:

 - Fixed Module::Build::Notes POD [David Golden]

 - Some commands had become silent by default, so added a few short status
   messages so users know something actually happened [David Golden]

 - Cleaned up Changes file formatting [David Golden]

 - Removed most PERL_CORE customizations from test files due to
   reorganization of dual-life modules in core (RT#49522) [David Golden]

0.35_05 - Wed Oct 28 17:20:59 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - Fix test failure in t/actions/installdeps.t when $^X is not the default
   perl [David Golden]

 - Work around $VERSION numbers in ActiveState with multiple underscores
   that prevent Module::Build from installing on Win32 [David Golden]

 - Fix bug cleaning compatibility Makefile when older ExtUtils::Manifest is
   installed [David Golden with help from David Cantrell]

 Other:

 - Suppressed more warnings from tests [David Golden]

 - Add provisional support for 'package NAME VERSION' syntax added in
   Perl 5.11.1 [David Golden]

0.35_04 - Fri Oct 23 11:20:41 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - Fix test failure if IPC::Cmd isn't installed [David Golden]

 Other:

 - Suppressed warning messages from various tests [David Golden]

0.35_03 - Wed Oct 21 21:20:59 EDT 2009

 *** API CHANGE ***

 - The prepare_metadata() method used to take a YAML::Node object as an
   argument for modification.  The method now takes no arguments and just
   returns a hash reference of metadata. [David Golden]

 Enhancements

 - Command line options may be set via the PERL_MB_OPT environment
   variable (similar to PERL_MM_OPT in ExtUtils::MakeMaker)

 Bug fixes:

 - Updated PPM generation to PPM v4 (RT#49600) [Olivier Mengue]

 - When c_source is specified, the directory scan will include additional,
   less-common C++ extensions (RT49298) [David Golden]

 - When module_name is not supplied, no packlist was being written; fixed
   by guessing module_name from dist_version_from or the directory name
   (just like ExtUtils::Manifest does without NAME) [David Golden]

 - Bumped IO::File prereq to fix binmode failures in PPMMaker on Perl
   prior to 5.8.8 [David Golden]

 Other:

 - Replaced use of YAML.pm with YAML::Tiny; Module::Build::YAML is now
   based on YAML::Tiny as well [David Golden]

 - Reduced amount of console output under normal operation (use --verbose
   to see all output) [David Golden]

0.35_02 - Mon Sep  7 22:37:42 EDT 2009

 Enhancements:

 - Added 'needs_compiler' property.  Defaults to true if XS or c_source
   exist.  If true, ExtUtils::CBuilder is also added to build_requires.
   [David Golden]

 - File::ShareDir automatically added to 'requires' if 'share_dir' is set
   [David Golden]

 - Added 'Build installdeps' action to install needed dependencies via
   a user-configurable command line program.  (Defaults to 'cpan'.)
   [Eric Wilhelm]

 Bug fixes:

 - Failure to detect a compiler will now warn during Build.PL and be a
   fatal error when trying to compile during Build. (RT#48918) [David
   Golden]

 - Fixed directory sorting failure in share_dir.t [David Golden]

 - Property defaults that are data structures were being assigned as
   references to new objects. Changed so that defaults are cloned instead.
   (This mostly affects testing, which often creates multiple objects in the
   same process) [David Golden]

 - Simplified error message on exit under use_tap_harness [suggested by
   David Wheeler]

 - Fixed typemap search to use a dist-level typemap if a typemap is not
   found in the directory with the *.xs file; (was manifesting as warnings
   in Perl 5.6 tests) [David Golden]

 Other:

 - Replaced guts of new_from_context().  Build.PL is now executed in a
   separate process before resume() is called.  (This is generally only of
   interest to Module::Build or toolchain developers) (RT#49350) [David
   Golden, Eric Wilhelm, Ken Williams]

 - Revised test helper classes to fix potential bugs and add new features
   to make writing tests simpler and easier.  Changes incorporated into
   t/README.pod and t/sample.t as examples for new testing. [David Golden]

0.35_01 - Mon Aug 31 12:11:10 EDT 2009

 Enhancements:

 - Generates MYMETA.yml during Build.PL (new standard protocol for
   communicating configuration results between toolchain components)
   [David Golden]

 - Added 'share_dir' property to provide File::ShareDir support;
   set automatically if a directory called 'share' exists
   [David Golden]

 Bug fixes:

 - Fix the t/destinations.t fix. [David Golden, with thanks to Eric Wilhelm]

 - Fix recursive test files in generated Makefile.PL (RT#49254) [Sawyer X]

 - Guard against trying :utf8 when :utf8 isn't available

 - The "test" action now dies when using the 'use_tap_harness'
   option and tests fail, matching the behavior under Test::Harness.
   (RT#49080) [initial patch from David Wheeler; revised by David Golden]

 Other:

 - Added t/README.pod and t/sample.t to guide developers writing new tests
   [David Golden, with some code from Eric Wilhelm]

 - Module::Build::Compat 'passthrough' style has been deprecated.  Using
   'passthrough' will issue warnings on Makefile.PL generation.  See
   Module::Build::Compat documentation for rationale.

0.35 - Thu Aug 27 09:12:02 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:

  - Fix t/destinations.t segfault on 5.6.2 [David Golden]

0.34_06 - Sat Aug 22 21:58:26 EDT 2009

 - Fixed preservation of custom install_paths on resume (RT#41166)
   [David Golden]

 - Warn instead of crashing when Pod::Man tries to create files with
   colons on vfat partitions on unix (RT#45544) [David Golden]

0.34_05 - Sun Aug  9 22:31:37 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - When auto_configure_requires is true (the default), Module::Build will
   only add last 'major' version of Module:Build (e.g. 0.XX) to
   configure_requires to avoid specifying a minor development release not
   available on CPAN [David Golden]

0.34_04 - Sat Aug  8 11:02:24 EDT 2009

 Other:

 - Added documentation warning that 'get_options' should be capitalized
   to avoid conflicting with future Module::Build options and changed
   the examples accordingly.

0.34_03 - Sat Aug  8 07:39:16 EDT 2009

 Bug fixes:

 - Fixed failing xs.t if /tmp is mounted noexec (RT#47331) [David Golden]

 - Fixed failing debug.t on VMS (RT#48362) [Craig Berry]

 - Prevent par.t from dying on error in .zip extraction [David Golden]

 - Fixed potential runthrough.t failure on 5.6.2 [David Golden]

 Other:

 - Archive::Tar changed from 'requires' to 'recommends' so non-authors
   without IO::Zlib can still use Module::Build to install modules
   [reported by Matt Trout, fix by David Golden]

0.340201 - Sun Aug  9 22:11:04 EDT 2009

 No changes from 0.33_06

0.33_06 - Sun Jul  5 10:11:40 EDT 2009

 Bug-fixes:

 - Bundled version code will use pure Perl on 5.10.0 to work around
   a corner case involving eval and locale [John Peacock]

 - Reversed VMS patch from 0.33_03 [Craig Berry]

 - PL_files in Build.PL that are in the bin/scripts directory should not be
   installed as if they are scripts (fixed for case-tolerant systems).
   [David Golden, reported by Craig Berry]

0.33_05 - Sun Jun 28 22:06:49 EDT 2009

 Enhancements:

 - New 'auto_configure_requires' parameter (default 1) controls
   whether Module::Build should add itself to configure_requires
   in META.yml if not specified in Build.PL [David Golden]

 Bug-fixes:

 - The default MANIFEST.SKIP created by the "manifest" action
   was out of date.  It will now use the installed MANIFEST.SKIP
   and add some Module::Build and distribution specific items
   to it. [Michael Schwern]

 Other:

 - configure_requires do not necessarily need to be in requires
   or build_requires; warning to that effect has been removed
   [David Golden]

0.33_04 - Fri Jun 26 07:09:06 EDT 2009

 Bug-fixes:

 - Don't try utf8 YAML I/O on Perl 5.6 [David Golden]

 Other:

   since Module::Buld does not support static linking (RT#46178)
   [David Golden]

 - skip failing test in par.t if Archive::Zip is broken [David Golden]

 - Added YAML utf8 patch in 0.33_03 changes list

 - Added attribution for patches in 0.33_03 changes list

 Bug-fixes:

 - Removes Module::Build from its own configure/build_requires
   [David Golden]

 - ConfigData->feature() confirms that modules actually load successfully,
   not just that they are present. (RT#43557) [David Golden]

 - Module::Build::Compat handling of INSTALL*LIB (RT#43827)
   [Tony Payne, David Golden]

 - Module::Build::Compat and recursive test files (RT#39171) [Dave Rolsky]

   tests and documentation related to this issue [David Golden]

 - Caches ExtUtils::CBuilder object in a temporary stash instead of properties

 - Fixed undef resources->license in META.yml (RT #44453).

 - Use $^X instead of 'perl' in t/ext.t [David Golden] (RT #43485)

 Other:

 - Generated META.yml will indicate version 1.4 of the specification
   (RT #37478) [patch from Alexandr Ciornii]

 - Archive::Tar now the default for generating tarballs on all platforms
   (avoids problems with incompatible tar binaries)

 - dist_dir() now uses dist_name() and dist_version() accessors rather
   than using its properties directly. [brian d foy] (RT #45038)

0.32 - Wed Feb 25 17:40:02 PST 2009

 No changes since 0.31_04.

0.31_04 - Fri Feb 20 11:04:59 PST 2009

 Other

   test failures when installing Module::Build using CPANPLUS::Dist::Build)
   [David Golden]

0.31_03 - Sun Feb  8 14:54:01 PST 2009

 Enhancements

 - added a "prereq_data" action that prints a Perl data structure of
   all prerequisites; can be loaded by external tools using eval()
   [David Golden]

 Bug-fixes

 - 'fakeinstall' action warns and skips without ExtUtils::Install 1.32+
   [David Golden, reported by Zefram]

 - allows Module::Build version mismatch when installing self; works around

 - sets $^X to absolute path in tests (backported from bleadperl)

0.31 - Sat Dec 20 15:03:33 2008

 Deprecations

 - Use of attributes as class methods is deprecated (this was never a
   documented feature and appears to only have worked accidentally.)

0.30_02 - Mon Dec 15 12:23:55 PST 2008

 Bug Fixes

 - make Software::License dependency "softer".

0.30_01 - Thu Dec 11 18:25:53 PST 2008

 New Docs

 - Added a recipe for writing a new action to the Cookbook

 - Added a recipe for bundling Module::Build to the Cookbook.

   Domgoergen]

 Bug Fixes

 - Workaround HARNESS_TIMER env issue in t/compat.t (RT#39635)

   when running sudo.  [rt.cpan.org 39662]

 - Fixed a small POD error in the Cookbook. [Damyan Ivanov]

 - Unset group/other write permission bits when using Archive::Tar to
   build the dist tarball. (RT#39804) [David Golden]

 Enhancements

 - We now support a 'create_license' parameter to new() that will
   create a LICENSE file during the 'dist' phase with the full text of
   the license.  This requires Software::License on the author's
   machine.

 - Added lgpl2/lgpl3 entries to the supported licenses (RT#40532).

0.30 - Thu Sep 25 20:57:36 2008

 - First non-beta release since April 2007.  In the meantime, Sarkozy
   became president of France, the 35W bridge fell in Minneapolis,
   Phelps won a lot of gold, a new tribe of indigenous people was
   discovered in the Amazon, and Bob Barker stopped doing The Price Is
   Right.  As of this moment though, the U.S. economy still hasn't
   collapsed completely.

0.2808_05 - Thu Sep 18 23:30:39 PDT 2008

 - Skip test in t/ext.t which tickles shellwords() in Text::ParseWords
   below 3.23 [David Wheeler, Ken]

 - Fixed some shell-quoting issues in do_system() on Windows [Ken,
   Schwern, reported by Curtis Jewell]

 - Fixed t/xs.t failure for missing 'const char *' typemap in 5.6

   Removed bundled Test::More (was not working for 5.005x anyway).
   [Schwern]

 - Minimum required perl version is now 5.6.1. [Schwern]

0.2808_04 - Thu Sep 11 22:51:27 PDT 2008

 - Backed-out incompatible Module::Build::ModuleInfo change (first in
   0.2808_02.)

0.2808_03 - Mon Sep  1 14:43:27 PDT 2008

 - Made adjustments for the format changes of recent Test::Harness
   output. [Nicholas Clark]

 - Fixed the documentation for script_files to indicate that we search
   bin/ for scripts by default.  It has been this way for several
   years. [Spotted by Ron Savage]

0.2808_02 - Wed Jul  9 16:45:08 PDT 2008

 - Experimental support for TAP::Harness with --use-tap-harness option
   and the tap_harness_args property. [David Wheeler & Eric Wilhelm]

 - Added test_file_exts property for main-run tests other than '*.t'.
   [David Wheeler]

 - Fixed getcwd()/rmtree() failure case on 5.10+mac where something is
   unhappy about all of the tests deleting their distgen directory
   before leaving it. [Eric Wilhelm & David Wheeler]

 - Improved support for parsing qv() in modules' $VERSION
   declarations, and made $VERSION-parsing errors more verbose. [Jos
   Boumans]

 - Integrated an omnibus patch for various VMS fixes. [Craig Berry &
   John E. Malmberg]

 - Some versions of Test::Harness (or something) seem to not be
   stripping the ".t" suffix when outputting test reports, which was
   causing one of our tests in t/compat.t to fail.  Fixed. [Spotted by
   a smoke tester]

 - Most Unix platforms seem to allow hyphens in usernames, so we honor
   this in our de-tilde-fying methods now. [Spotted by s-murata]

 - If there are multiple assignments to the $VERSION variable in
   someone's module and this generates warnings, tell the user what
   line number the problem is at.

 - Added 'gnu' and 'gnukfreebsd' as Unix variants. [Niko Tyni]

 - Fixed a couple bugs in how we quote arguments to external processes
   when they have to pass through the shell.  Also much more
   thoroughly tested our quoting now.

 - Edited the Module::Build::API docs prose about the 'license' field
   in response to some comments on the module-authors mailing list.

 - Fixed a typo in some example code in the Cookbook. [Jeremy Leader]

 - Custom typemaps were being looked for in places that don't quite
   exist; fixed. [Michael G Schwern]

 - QNX/Neutrino is now considered to be Unix. [rt.cpan.org 32214]

 - Added 'gpl2' and 'gpl3' to the list of valid licenses. [Allen
   Engelhardt]

   $Data::Dumper::Terse. [Spotted by Dominique Dumont]

 - Documented the fix_shebang_line() method. [Elliot Shank]

 - Applied the 'const' modifier to version() and xs_version() XS
   functions we use during testing. [Robin Barker]

 - Fixed processing of INC=, POLLUTE=, INSTALLDIRS=, and LIB= for
   passthrough/small Makefile.PLs.

 - perl Build.PL --sign=1 now signs. [Michael G Schwern]

 - Fixed processing of INSTALLDIRS=whatever for compatibility
   Makefiles. [Spotted by John Peacock]

 - Zillions of special-cases have been added in Compat.pm for dealing
   with the special Makefile system on VMS. [John E. Malmberg]

 - Fixed some stuff in how VMS command-args get quoted. [John E. Malmberg]

 - VMS now overrides localize_file_path() and localize_dir_path() so
   we don't need to do special stuff in the general case. [John
   E. Malmberg]

 - Added a few more VMS-specific entries to the default MANIFEST.SKIP
   file that (sometimes) gets created during the 'manifest'
   action. [John E. Malmberg]

 - Fixed a catdir() that should have been a catfile() when creating a
   ppmdist. [John E. Malmberg]

 - Removed some assumptions about what makefiles are called (not
   necessarily "Makefile") and how they take their arguments, to get
   VMS tests working better. [John E. Malmberg]

 - Fixed our check for Archive::Tar in the t/runthrough.t test, which
   fixes a common failure on Win32. [Spotted by Chris Williams]

 - Fixed a File::Spec mal-ism in t/destinations.t [Craig A. Berry]

 - Exposed the internal ExtUtils::CBuilder object as part of our API,
   via the cbuilder() method. [Zefram]

 - Upgraded to version.pm 0.74 (fixes bug #30004.)

 - Overwrite core (post-5.9.4) Module::Build installs (bug #20528.)

 - Pass quiet() option to ExtUtils::CBuilder object.

0.2808_01 - Wed Oct 24 11:51:25 2007

 - All .pm files in the Module-Build distribution (except for
   M::B::Version.pm, which is kind of tied to version.pm) now have the
   same $VERSION number explicitly specified.

 - When checking prerequisites, the required version of perl is now
   checked before we start finding the $VERSION declaration of the
   distribution, which results in much more intuitive error messages
   e.g. if the author is using 5.6-isms in their declaration but the
   user doesn't have 5.6. [Slaven Rezic]

 - Added 'artistic_2' license, corrected 'lgpl' license url (bug #29783)
   [David Thomas]

 - VMS find_perl_interpreter() is just $^X (bug #29810) [Craig A. Berry]

 - Some large VMS fixes, mostly having to do with the non-case-
   preserving nature of most VMS filesystems, but also correcting for
   illegal characters in VMS file specs. [John E. Malmberg and Craig
   A. Berry]

 - Fixed the _detildefy() method on VMS. [John E. Malmberg and Craig
   A. Berry]

 - We now use a much more reliable method when Data::Dumper-ing saved
   state data. [Yves]

 - When a module had 0.000 as its version, a few places in the code
   thought the module had no version at all.  This is now
   fixed. [Andrew "Zefram" Main]

 - When finding the default set of script_files, we now compute them
   as relative paths, not absolute. [Spotted by Curtis "Ovid" Poe]

 - Got rid of a call to eliminate_macros, which isn't needed in
   Module::Build since there is no external make utility involved.
   Override expand_test_dir to make up for the fact that the
   home-grown glob() returns absolute, not relative, paths. [Craig
   A. Berry]

 - Fixed a catdir() that needed to be catfile() in the .packlist
   creation code. [John E. Malmberg]

 - If a *.PL file ended abnormally during the build, processing should
   have stopped, but it didn't.  Fixed. [Matthew Cast and David
   Golden]

 - Module::Build::Compat adds "require 5.XXXXX" to Makefile.PL when
   'perl' is specified as a 'requires' prerequisite [David Golden]

 - Refactored t/compat.t for modularity and transparency; added
   labels for all tests; supressed subprocess output to
   STDOUT and STDERR [David Golden]

 - Fixed bug in perl_version_to_float when version is already a float
   [David Golden]

 - Removed a mention of $build->{config} from the documentation, the
   official interface to Config.pm settings is now via the
   $build->config() and has been for some time. [Suggested by Michael
   Schwern]

 - Tweaked some text in the Cookbook to bring it into the modern age,
   and added a recipe for accessing Config.pm settings. [Ibid]

 - Lots of POD link/readability improvements to the Module::Build::API
   documentation [Salve J. Nilsen]

 - Added configure_requires as a new type of prereq.  [Suggested by Adam
   Kennedy]

 - Patch 31156 from bleadperl: some filename dot and extension help
   for Module::Build on VMS. [Craig Berry]

 - Reworked the _detildefy() method so it doesn't depend on glob()
   anymore.  This gets rid of a problem with spaces or other special
   shell characters in things like 'prefix' or 'install_path'
   entries. [Prodding by Eric Wilhelm]

 - Added midnightbsd to the list of Unix-like OSes we know about
   [Rafael Garcia-Suarez]

0.2808 - Sat Apr 28 12:59:43 2007

 - Added is_vmsish(), is_windowsish(), and is_unixish() boolean
   convenience functions.  Fixes some test failures on platforms where
   $^O is set to a value we don't know about (like 'gnu').

 - Upgraded to version.pm 0.7203. [John Peacock]

 - Support get_action_docs() =head2 style. [ewilhelm]

 - Workaround Test::Pod::Coverage @INC bug. [Eric Wilhelm]

 - Fixed the command-line args --extra_compiler_flags and
   --extra_linker_flags so they properly shell-split their arguments.

0.2807 - Sat Mar 24 22:19:02 2007

 - Upgraded to version.pm 0.71. [John Peacock]

 - Removed a couple small constructs in the tests ("use warnings;" and
   "qw$foo bar$[1]") that caused test failures under perl 5.005.

 - Added support for an explicit default value of undef in prompt().
   [Eric Wilhelm]

 - Improved our prompt() method, which could sometimes hang before the
   user got a chance to see a prompt. [Andreas Koenig]

 - Added a note about --allow_mb_mismatch to the error message that
   happens right before someone might want to use that parameter.

 - Added DragonflyBSD to the list of known Unix OSes.

 - get_action_docs() dies on error rather than twiddling $@

 - Made ModuleInfo's _evaluate_version_line() compatible with 'use
   version ...$VERSION' lines.  [Eric Wilhelm]

 - Added some verbiage in Module::Build::API that officially blesses
   the _build/prereqs file for external consumption. [Suggested by Andreas Koenig]

 - Added test profiles support via the test_types property and "testall"
   target. [Eric Wilhelm, Jeff Lavallee]

 - Use syscopy() on OS/2 in copy_if_modified() so we make sure to
   overwrite any existing target file. [Ilya Zakharevich]

 - Removed seemingly silly '~~' test in t/tilde.t.

 - In our test-time utility library t/lib/MBTest.pm, we need to know
   about a few .exe-like extensions on OS/2. [Ilya Zakharevich]

 - In t/ppm.t, use DynaLoader::mod2fname() (if available) to determine
   the correct translation of our test module's name into a DLL
   name. [Ilya Zakharevich]

 - Avoid an unlink() error on OS/2 when fixing shebang lines. [Ilya
   Zakharevich]

 - When we're protecting the world from the evils of long RedHat
   $ENV{PERL5LIB} variables, don't assume $ENV{PERL5LIB} is already
   defined.  This gets rid of a huge number of warnings for some
   people. [Dave Rolsky]

0.2806 - Fri Dec 15 22:20:14 2006

 - On some systems (haven't identified the actual problem yet)
   $ENV{PERL5LIB} can grow to enormous enough sizes that we can't
   launch any more subprocesses because the environment table is full.
   This is the now-infamous "Couldn't run Build.PL: Argument list too
   long" error.  Now we detect such situations and trim the directory
   list to only include directories that actually exist, listed only
   once each.  Not the ideal solution, but it should work.

 - Silence a warning in M::B::ModuleInfo that happens when the author
   is using the "$VERSION = eval $VERSION" idiom.

 - When running the 'testcover' action, do "cover --delete" if any of
   the test files have changed (we already did so if any of the code
   under test has changed). [Suggested by Chris Dolan, RT #23584]

 - Fixed a broken link in the documentation about PREFIX. [Spotted by
   David Steinbrunner]

 - Changes to do_system() & friends on VMS to get system calls working
   much better there. [Craig Berry]

 - Added the "pardist" target which creates a PAR binary distribution
   akin to a PPM distribution. [Steffen Mueller]

 - Added the Interix platform as a Unix variant. [Stephen Hartland]

 - Improved the error message we emit when a distribution contains XS
   files but the user has no C compiler. [Suggested by Andreas Koenig]

0.2805_01  Thu Sep  7 21:57:29 CDT 2006

 - Because of a weird behavior of YAML::Node, any distribution that
   used version.pm objects to define their versions was generating the
   wrong syntax for the versions in their META.yml file.  They will
   now appear as strings like v3.42.1 or similar, including the
   leading v.

 - Upgraded to version 0.67 of version.pm. [John Peacock]

 - Added a contrib/ directory with a bash completion function for M::B
   actions and switches. [Julian Mehnle]

 - When we eval() the embedded version.pm code we will now die() if
   the eval() was unsuccessful, rather than continuing blindly on and
   dying mysteriously later.

 - Added a 'retest' action that lets users run the current regression
   tests on a previously-installed version of a distribution.

 * Instead of storing an entire dump of the Config.pm hash in the
   _build/ directory upon startup, we now just store any overrides the
   user or author has specified.  Note that if you were doing anything
   you weren't supposed to be doing, like poking around in the
   internals of $buld->{config}, your code might break, so I've put
   the asterisk of incompatibility on this one just to cover my
   tuchus.  [Idea originally by Randy Sims]

 - Made copying files via copy_if_modified() a little less chatty.

0.2805  Sat Jul 29 22:01:24 CDT 2006

 - We now embed a copy of version.pm right in the
   Module::Build::Version source code, with John Peacock's blessing,
   in case the user has a rough time installing version.pm.  This
   helps alleviate troubles people were still having with working out
   a seemingly circular dependency (even though version.pm now ships
   with a standard Makefile.PL too).  A version.pm >= 0.661 installed
   on the system will take precedence over our bundled one. [John
   Peacock]

 - Fix some test warnings (or failures?) related to version.pm
   numification. [John Peacock]

 - The top-level 'version' entry in META.yml files we'd generated was
   in the wrong format (it was being treated as a version.pm object
   rather than a serialized copy) due to a weird YAML::Node issue.
   Fixed.

 - Don't 'use base qw(version)' anymore in our M::B::Version wrapper,
   just set @ISA directly, because some people have reported that the
   'use base' line is croaking.

 - Added an 'allow_mb_mismatch' parameter to suppress the startup
   check that ensures the version of M::B currently running is the
   same as the one initially used to run the Build.PL.  Use with
   caution.

 - Module::Build::ModuleInfo will no longer detect things that look
   like $VERSION assignments after an __END__ or __DATA__ token.

 - Updated documentation to mention the new mailing list on perl.org
   rather than the old one on sourceforge.

0.2804  Sun Jul 16 16:41:25 CDT 2006

 - Added 'use version;' in Module::Build::Version, because some
   versions of base.pm won't automatically load version.pm when we do
   'use base qw/version/;'. [Spotted by Erik Tank]

0.2803  Sat Jul 15 08:26:34 CDT 2006

 - The META.yml file in the last release was all screwed up, so the
   distribution wasn't indexed properly.  Fixed in this release.

0.2802  Fri Jul 14 22:40:34 CDT 2006

 - Added reliance on version.pm, which means we should deal much
   better with the wide range of version specifications one finds on
   CPAN.  This is made possible by recent releases of version.pm that
   give the user a pure-perl option, so installing version.pm
   shouldn't be too onerous for most users.  [John Peacock]

 - We should be accepting the default when we're in unattended mode,
   not acting dumb and ignoring both the default and the [empty]
   answer from the user.  Fixed.  [Spotted by Nik Clayton]

0.2801  Sun May 21 00:07:40 CDT 2006

 - Module::Build::Compat's emulation of INC is incorrectly prepending
   a -I to the value of INC. This is incorrect because there should
   already be a -I on the value. I.E. it's "perl Makefile.PL INC=-Ifoo"
   not "perl Makefile.PL INC=foo" so Compat should not prefix a -I.
   [Michael Schwern]

 - Native batch scripts under Windows should not be converted by
   pl2bat. [Spotted by Ron Savage]

 - Tweaked the way we determine whether a file is executable on Unix.
   We use this determination to decide whether to make it executable
   during installation. [Julian Mehnle]

 - Replaced a vestigial 'next' with 'return' now that the code is in a
   subroutine (htmlify_pods()), not a loop. [Ron Savage]

 - Fixed a guaranteed failure in t/signature.t when TEST_SIGNATURE was
   set. [Eric R. Meyers]

 - Fixed a test failure that occurred when testing or installing in
   unattended mode - the code to test whether unattended mode and
   attended mode are working properly was assuming that we started out
   in attended mode. [Steve Peters]

 - Improved our stand-in YAML generator that we use to generate
   META.yaml when authors don't have a copy of YAML.pm installed on
   their machine.  It was unable to handle things like embedded
   newlines in the data, now it has a much more extensive escaping
   mechanism. [Stephen Adkins]

 - Revised the docs for --prefix and PREFIX. [Michael Schwern]

0.28  Thu Apr 27 22:25:00 CDT 2006

 - When y_n() or prompt() are called without a default value and the
   build seems to be unattended (e.g. in automatic CPAN testing), we
   now die() with an error message rather than silently returning
   undef for prompt(), or looping indefinitely for y_n().

 - When searching for '.modulebuildrc', return the first HOME-like
   directory that actually contains the file instead of the first
   existing directory. Document the search locations and the order
   searched. [Spotted by David Golden]

 - Split the API documentation out of Module::Build::Authoring into
   its own document: Module::Build::API.

 - We should not emit a warning if a Module::Build subclass is
   required in a Makefile.PL that is not bundled in the current
   distribution; it may be installed on the user's system. [Spotted by
   Tyler MacDonald]

 - copy_if_modified() now preserves the executable bit of the source
   file. [Spotted by Julian Mehnle]

 - Fixed compatibility of our screen-scraping the Test::Harness output
   so we can recognize the most recent Test::Harness version. [Steve
   Hay]

 - Backing out a requirement added in 0.27_06 on the method y_n()
   to always include a default. This behavior would cause existing
   build scripts to start failing. We now fail with a missing default
   only when $ENV{PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT} is set because there is no
   reasonable default.

 - Make install_types() method smarter with respect to custom install
   types.

 - Add documentation for the install_base_relpaths() and
   prefix_relpaths() methods. Improved their usage for a public API,
   and added tests.

0.27_10  Tue Mar 28 22:50:50 CST 2006

 - Added the create_packlist property, default true, which controls
   whether packlist files will be written during installation.  This
   was already part of Module::Build 0.2609, but for some reason we've
   forgotten it in the 0.27_xx series.  [Spotted by Steve Kirkup]

 - Document the versions of Module::Build where each feature, action,
   constructor argument, and method was first publicly documented.

 - More fixes for find_perl_interpreter() to work with BSD flavored
   UNIX: Ensure we always return absolute paths; throw an exception
   upon failure to find correct interperter; document everything.

 - We now include our own YAML.pm work-alike that we can use when the
   real YAML isn't installed.  We might soon even start using it when
   YAML is installed, because the YAML API and dependency chain have
   been changing in unfavorable ways lately. [Stephen Adkins]

 - Fixed some shell-argument-quoting issues on VMS.  In the process,
   we have added some support for avoiding tripping over
   shell-argument-quoting issues on other platforms too. [Initial
   patch by Craig A. Berry]

0.27_09  Sat Mar 11 22:48:54 EST 2006

 - Fixed find_perl_interpreter() so we can find the perl executable
   when running from uninstalled perl even when $^X contains a
   relative path. [Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes]

 - Fixed warning message where we were printing the wrong field names.
   [Chris Dolan]

 - Added a 'testpodcoverage' action that runs a POD coverage check for
   all modules in the distribution. [Yanick Champoux]

 - Added a Cookbook example of subclassing to modify an action. [Dylan
   Martin and David Golden]

 - When building HTML documentation, we were opening the POD file and
   not checking whether the open succeeded, which of course caused
   problems down the line if it failed.  Now we do "or die(...)" like
   everywhere else. [Spotted by Joerg Braun]

0.27_08  Fri Mar  3 21:22:41 CST 2006

 - Due to shell quoting issues and differences in syntax between
   various flavors of Windows, the code for the 'pl2bat' utility
   distributed with Perl has been incorporated into M::B::P::Windows.
   [Thanks to Dr Bean and Ron Savage for help testing and isolating
   the problem.]

 - Modify add_build_element() so that it only adds elements if they
   don't already exist. [David Wheeler]

 - Fixed a bug in the 'pass-through' Makefile.PL in which we would die
   if CPAN::Shell->install returned false, but apparently this return
   value is unreliable.  Now we only die if the module is actually
   unavailable after installation.

 - Fixed testing problems on VMS related to non-case-preserving
   filesystems.  We now bundle Tie::CPHash in the distribution (just
   for testing purposes, it doesn't get installed) to help with
   this. [Craig Berry and Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes]

 - We incorrectly documented the 'dynamic_config' flag in the META.yml
   file as having a default value of false, but according to the
   META.yml spec (which, for heaven's sake, we wrote) its default
   value is true.  Fixed. [Spotted by Adam Kennedy]

 - The have_c_compiler() method was dying if the ExtUtils::CBuilder
   module wasn't around, which is obviously an unhelpful thing to do.
   Now it just returns false. [Spotted by John Peacock]

 - Fix detection of $VERSION expressions that are not
   assignments. [Spotted by Chris Dolan]

 - Obfuscate one of our constructs that uses a $VERSION variable,
   because it was getting picked up by ExtUtils::MakeMaker's
   version-finder. [Spotted by Randal Schwartz]

 - The config_data script for querying and/or setting a module's
   config data was forgetting to call write() after setting config
   values (though setting feature values was working fine).
   Fixed. [Brian Duggan]

 - On Windows, remove the pl2bat generated 'Build.bat' script without
   the annoying "The batch file cannot be found." error.  [Solution
   provided by RazTK and foxidrive on newsgroup alt.msdos.batch]

 - Our version comparisons should now work correctly with modules that
   use version.pm to delcare their versions (e.g. "our $VERSION =
   version->new('1.0.0')"). [John Peacock and Ron Savage]

 - We now create a Build.bat script on versions of Windows where it
   makes sense. [Yves]

 - Fixed the verbiage around choosing the correct make-alike on
   different platforms to suggest using 'perl -V:make'. [Suggested by
   anonymous user]

0.27_07  Wed Feb  1 20:07:45 CST 2006

 - The notes() method now returns the new value when called with two
   arguments, just like when it's called with one argument. [Tyler
   MacDonald]

 - The notes() method now distinguishes among the values undef, 0, and
   the empty string, where previously it didn't. [Tyler MacDonald]

 - We now unshift(@INC) rather than push(@INC) for the directory where
   a build subclass lives, so that we're sure to pick up the right
   version and not some already-installed version. [perlmonkey]

 - The SIGNATURE file for version 0.27_06 (and I'm sure for lots of
   versions before that too!) was messed up, since we were modifying
   some files after signing.  This has been band-aided for the time
   being by signing twice. [Reported by Chris Dolan]

0.27_06  Mon Jan 23 21:44:54 CST 2006

 - Fixed an undefined-variable warning when building the META.yml file
   and the author hasn't used the 'module_name' mechanism. [Chris Dolan]

 - We should now work with recent (> 0.49) versions of YAML.pm when
   creating the META.yml file. [Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes]

 - The y_n() method now requires the default parameter, and the
   prompt() and y_n() methods have been improved with respect to
   how they behave/detect when there is no user to ask.  We're now
   more consistent with MakeMaker, including respecting the
   PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT environment variable. [Tyler MacDonald and
   Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes]

 - When building a README file using Pod::Text, work around a bug in
   Pod::Text 3.01, which expects Pod::Simple::parse_file to take input
   and output filehandles when it actually only takes an input
   filehandle. [Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes]

0.27_05  Thu Jan 12 17:39:21 CST 2006

 - In t/common.pl, we were attempting to let the user's installed
   Test::More take precedence over ours, but getting thwarted by all
   the test scripts' loading Test::More beforehand.  Fixed. [Spotted
   by Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes]

 - In various test scripts, we were outputting some strings that
   weren't strictly conformant with Test::Harness's expected input,
   though it didn't actually cause problems.  Now we're more
   conformant, though not yet strict. [Spotted by Yitzchak
   Scott-Thoennes]

0.27_04  Fri Dec 23 10:43:34 CST 2005

 - Removed experimental feature that extended the prerequisite system
   to apply ('requires', 'recommends', and 'conflicts') prereqs to all
   actions. Most of the internal extensiblity has been retained so
   that prereq types can easily be added, more selectively.

 - Added a 'prereq_report' action that shows the user a well-formatted
   list of all prerequisites, the versions required, and the versions
   actually installed. [David Wheeler]

 - Clarified the directory name that's created during the 'distdir'
   action. [Suggested by Tyler MacDonald]

 - Fixed a bug when creating the META.yml file without the help of
   YAML.pm - some common strings weren't quoted & escaped properly.
   Now only some uncommon ones are. [Spotted by Joshua ben Jore]

 - Fixed a bug in which an "UNINST=1" argument specified to a
   passthrough Makefile's "make install" wasn't actually seen by
   Module::Build.

 - Rather than dying when the Build script is run from the wrong
   directory, it now simply chdir()s into the right directory and
   keeps going. [Suggested by Dominique Quatravaux]

 - Added an "Examples on CPAN" section to the cookbook, with an
   initial entry pointing to John Peacock's SVN-Notify-Mirror
   distribution.

 - Add an invoked_action() method to return the name of the original
   action invoked by the user.

 - Add 'meta-spec' field to the generated META.yml file, including the
   version of the specification followed by the current Module::Build
   and the url where the specification can be found.

 - Introduced two actions, 'html' & 'manpages', that generate
   documentation for POD when the respective feature is enabled.  The
   actions will generate the documents even if there is no set place
   to install to.  However, if the actions are invoked as a dependency
   of another action (e.g. build), the documentation will only be
   built when there is a default or user-specified place to install to.

 - Added support for environment variable, 'MODULEBUILDRC', which can
   be used to specify the full path to an option file to use instead
   of the default location of ~/.modulebuildrc. A special undocumented
   setting of 'NONE' tells Module::Build not to load any user settings,
   so tests can be run without tainting from user options.

 - Documented and improved preliminary support for more Getopt::Long
   style options are supported, including boolean options (--verbose,
   --no-verbose), and use of hyphens in option names in addition to
   underscores.

 - The option to disable/enable reading of the ~/.modulebuildrc file
   is changed from 'skip_rcfile' to 'use_rcfile'

 - Allow the 'distmeta' action to continue when 'MANIFEST' is missing,
   omitting the generation of the 'provieds' field. [Steven Schubiger]

 - Fixed some failing regex from generated MANIFEST.SKIP file.

 - Fixed an edge case in $VERSION parsing where we thought a package()
   declaration was happening but it wasn't. [David Golden]

 - Added docs for the install_destination() and install_types() methods.

0.27_03 (Beta for 0.28)  Mon Oct 10 11:19:23 EDT 2005

 - We now use ExtUtils::CBuilder to do all compiling of C code (for
   example, when compiling XS modules).  (This change actually
   occurred in 0.27_01, but it was mistakenly omitted from the Changes
   file.)

 - Fixed an issue on Win32 (and other case-tolerant
   non-case-preserving systems, possibly like VMS?) in which the
   current working directory would sometimes be reported with
   different case, fooling us into thinking that we were in the wrong
   directory. [David Golden]

 - The extra_compiler_flags setting was not actually being passed
   along to ExtUtils::CBuilder so it could pass it along to the
   compiler.  Now it is.

 - The synonyms 'scripts' and 'prereq' for 'script_files' and
   'requires' were broken in a previous version (0.27_01, probably),
   but now they're fixed. [David Golden]

 - Previously, we assumed that any custom subclass of Module::Build
   was located in _build/lib/.  This is only true if the author used
   the subclass() method, though.  We now use %INC to find where the
   custom subclass really is, so that we can "use lib" it.  We also
   issue a warning if it seems to be outside the build directory.
   [Spotted by Peter Tandler]

 - Added a URL for each license type that we know about, which will
   appear as resources=>license: in the generated META.yml file.

 - If the user passes a no_index parameter to our constructor, we now
   pass that through when building the META.yml file. [Richard
   Soderberg, RT #9603]

 - A few more status messages can now be suppressed by using 'quiet'
   mode.  [Dave Rolsky]

 - Added some more entries to the default MANIFEST.SKIP file. [Chris
   Dolan]

 - Our POD parser will now accept "AUTHORS" as well as "AUTHOR" when
   looking for the author list in a module. [David Wheeler]

 - When looking for the POD to auto-generate a README file, or for the
   AUTHOR or ABSTRACT for the distribution, we now also look for a
   *.pod with the same name as the *.pm file specified by
   'version_from'. [David Golden]

 - The recommended dependency on ExtUtils::ParseXS has been moved into
   the "C_support" auto_feature.

 - When building XS files, we now pass the -DVERSION and -DXS_VERSION
   flags to the compiler. [Spotted by Jerry Hedden]

 - If a distribution has XS files and Module::Build has not been
   configured with the "C_support" feature, we now issue a
   warning. [Suggested by Jerry Hedden]

 - Added a dir_contains() method.

 - Some versions of MakeMaker, CPANPLUS, and/or PAUSE thought that a
   certain line of our code was declaring a $VERSION when we didn't
   intend to.  The line has been obscurified so they won't think that
   anymore. [Jos Boumans, RT #14226]

 - Added the Apache, MIT, and Mozilla licenses to the list of licenses
   that this module knows about. [Bob Ippolito]

 - Fixed a pretty significant typo in the documentation for
   auto_features. [Spotted by Jonas B. Nielsen]

 - In order to aid people who want to do customization of the META.yml
   file, we've added a "metafile" property that can then be easily
   overridden in subclasses, changed do_create_meta_yml() to
   do_create_metafile(), and split out the code that actually
   generates the YAML into a new method, write_metafile(). [David
   Wheeler]

 - Fixed a couple of non-helpful behaviors with extra_compiler_flags
   and extra_linker_flags.  These will automatically be run through
   split_like_shell() when given to new() as strings.

 - When the user doesn't have ExtUtils::ParseXS installed and we use
   the old 'xsubpp', the displayed command line for creating the .c
   file from the .xs file was missing its newline.  Now it's got it.

0.27_02 (Beta for 0.28)  Fri Jul 15 07:34:58 CDT 2005

 - Provided initial support for the --prefix installation parameter,
   which acts like MakeMaker's PREFIX.  It is still highly recommended
   NOT to use it when you could reasonably use --install_base or
   --install_path or --install_dest, but that's just because the way
   --prefix is designed is weird and unpredictable.  Ultimately the
   choice rests with the installing user. [Patches by Michael Schwern
   and Rob Kinyon]

 - Fixed a bug in subclass() which prevented people from using it to
   subclass subclasses of Module::Build. [Chris Dolan]

 - Added a 'pure_install' action, which for the time being is
   identical to the 'install' action. [Jos Boumans]

 - Fixed a POD error in an L<http://...> tag. [Offer Kaye]

 - Note several options for automatically creating a new module dev
   tree. [Suggested by Eric Wilhelm]

 - Removed some hard-coded references to File::Spec::Unix in the
   creation of HTML docs, which should help that code work in more
   places, and help people not to panic when they look at it. [Spotted
   by Yves]

 - We now use Pod::Readme by default (instead of Pod::Text) to
   generate the README file when the 'create_readme' option is used.
   If Pod::Readme is not installed, we will still fall back to using
   Pod::Text.  [Robert Rothenberg]

 - The values of the "prefix", "install_base", "install_path", and
   "install_dest" parameters can now begin with "~" or "~user", and
   we'll de-tilde-ify them by using glob().

 - The (optional) auto-creation of the README and Makefile.PL files
   have been moved from the 'distdir' action to the 'distmeta'
   action. [David Golden]

 - When looking for a .modulebuildrc file, we now use a fancier method
   of trying to find the home directory, because $ENV{HOME} isn't a
   very cross-platform variable. [Robert Rothenberg]

 - We now memoize the output of the internal _default_INC() method,
   since it uses backticks and might be kind of slow.

 - When processing XS files, we now look for a typemap in lib/ as well
   as using the system's default typemap. [John Peacock]

 - The DESTDIR, PREFIX, and INSTALL_BASE arguments to "make install"
   are now supported for pass-through Makefiles (they've been
   supported for quite a while as arguments to "perl
   Makefile.PL"). [Requested by Guillaume Rousse]

 - Test::Harness has changed its output format in recent versions,
   which threw off one of our tests.  We now allow for this different
   format. [Reported by Scott Godin]

 - Fixed an issue that prevented Module::Build from upgrading itself
   using its own API (which is how CPANPLUS uses it).  There are still
   some issues with this solution, however.  See ticket #13169 in
   rt.cpan.org. [Reported by Jos Boumans]

 - Fixed a fatal error that occurred when a distribution's author
   could not be determined from its POD nor from the call to
   Module::Build->new() in its Build.PL.  See ticket #12318 in
   rt.cpan.org. [Reported by Jos Boumans]

 - Apparently on Windows and cygwin it's not possible to use the "-pi"
   switch to perl without a backup extension, so now we use ".bak" and
   remove the backup file when we're done.  Thus the "dist" action for
   Module::Build itself can now be run on those platforms. [Yitzchak
   Scott-Thoennes]

 - Improved the handling of auto_features in the config_data access
   script. [Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes]

0.27_01 (Beta for 0.28)  Fri Apr 15 21:12:57 CDT 2005

 Backward-incompatible (but better) changes:

 * When using the 'install_base' option to choose a directory for
   installing everything, perl modules now go into lib/perl5/ instead
   of just lib/.  It seems this is more consistent with people's
   expectations, and the way I had it before was a bit peculiar to the
   way I like things in my own home directory. [Michael Schwern]

 * When the user is using the 'install_base' option, scripts will now
   be installed by default in $install_base/bin/ rather than
   $install_base/script/ . [Jan Hudec and Michael Schwern]

 Major changes:

 - The auto_features mechanism will now re-evaluate dependencies every
   time feature() is called for an auto-feature, rather than freezing
   the success/failure value during 'perl Build.PL' and using that
   value for all eternity (or module update, whichever comes first).
   This applies to both $build->feature() and
   FooModule::ConfigData->feature() calls. [Requested by many]

 - Added the meta_add and meta_merge mechanisms, which let the module
   author add/merge arbitrary entries into the META.yml file.

 - Now reads per-action default options from '$ENV{HOME}/.modulebuildrc'
   if it exists. Command line options override anything set in the rc file.

 - We now use ExtUtils::CBuilder to do all compiling of C code (for
   example, when compiling XS modules).

 - The creation of Unix man pages is no longer a strict necessity - it
   has now been turned into an 'auto-feature' contingent on the
   presence of Pod::Man and a location specified for man pages to go.

 - A user-specified 'install_path' setting will now take precedence
   over an 'install_base' setting.  This allows the user to use
   'install_base' to set the base for all elements in one go, and then
   use 'install_path' to override specific paths or add paths for
   additional kinds of targets.

 - Split the main documentation from 'Module/Build.pm' into two
   sections. The user level documentation and overview remains in
   'Module/Build.pm', while a new document,
   'Module/Build/Authoring.pod', has been created for module authors.

 Minor changes:

 - new_from_context() was losing its arguments in some cases (and not
   because of inadequate training in forensic debate) - we now pass its
   arguments directly to the Build.PL script rather than merging them
   in afterwards.

 - Let resume() return an object blessed into the appropriate class
   if the user has provided a subclass, as specified by the
   'build_class' property. This allows current() and new_from_context()
   to behave more like factory methods returning objects of the correct
   class based on context. [Ray Zimmerman]

 - Refactored methods relating to parsing perl module files for
   package, version, and pod data into a new class:
   Module::Build::ModuleInfo.  It should not be considered part of
   Module::Build's API, because we may split it out entirely as a
   separate CPAN module that we depend on.

 - Added new method Module::Build::prepare_metadata() for authors to
   override in order to add custom fields to META.yml.

 - We now use Test::More for our regression tests.  If the user
   doesn't have it installed, we include a copy in t/lib/ that we can
   use during testing.

 - When copying files in the 'distdir' action, set permissions to match
   the original files. [Julian Mehnle]

 - When adding files like META.yml to the MANIFEST, we now tell the
   user we're doing so by printing one of the "Added to MANIFEST: ..."
   lines.  [Ron Savage]

 - Added a runtime_params() method, which lets a module author see
   which parameters were overridden by the user on the command line
   (or in whatever paradigm the user originally invoked Module::Build
   from). [David Wheeler]

 - Added the current_action() method, which, surprisingly, returns the
   name of the currently running action. [David Wheeler]

 - Added docs for run_perl_script().

 - Added some stuff to the docs about why PREFIX is unsupported, and
   what to use instead. [Steve Purkis]

 - The simple get/set accessor methods for all the 'parameters' like
   verbose(), license(), etc. now have auto-generated documentation in
   Module/Build.pm.

 - Created a Cookbook entry for 'Adding new elements to the install
   process'

 - We now add META.yml to the MANIFEST when META.yml is created, not
   when MANIFEST is created. [Spotted by Ron Savage]

 - Added some additional patterns to the suggested MANIFEST.SKIP
   contents, and changed the docs so that we encourage the user to use
   the MANIFEST.SKIP.  [Ron Savage]

 - Eliminated a redundant recipe from the Cookbook, now that there are
   some more extensive recipes on how to add stuff to the
   build/install sequences.

 - Eliminated an undefined-variable warning when testing under perl 5.005

 - When building HTML documentation, 'html_backlink' and 'html_css'
   properties are now first-class properties, so they can be set from
   the command line. [Suggested by Sagar R. Shah]

 - Have script_files default to everything in bin.  I believe this is
   the least surprising behavior. [Suggested by Michael Schwern]

 - If script_files is given a directory, consider each file in that
   directory tree as a script to be installed.  This avoids having to
   remember to add to the script_files list every time you add a
   program. [Suggested by Michael Schwern]

 - We now only load Pod::Man when we actually need to build man pages.

 - We now make Test::Harness use our carefully-selected path to a perl
   executable regardless of Test::Harness's version.  Previously we
   let it figure stuff out for itself if it was a reasonably modern
   version, but it's safer to make sure we're using the same perl
   everywhere.

0.2610  Fri Apr 15 08:25:01 CDT 2005

 - new_from_context() was losing its arguments in some cases (and not
   because of inadequate training in debate) - we now pass its
   arguments directly to the Build.PL script rather than merging them
   in afterwards. [Ray Zimmerman]

 - Fixed a bug in which config_data and feature data were being
   forgotten and no ConfigData.pm module would get written. [Ray
   Zimmerman]

 - Added a recipe to the cookbook showing how to run a single test
   file from the command line. [William McKee]

 - For command-line arguments, we now accept the syntax "--foo=bar" in
   addition to "--foo bar" and "foo=bar".  This seems to fit well with
   what GNU getopt and Getopt::Long do, and with people's
   expectations. [Adam Spiers]

0.2609  Wed Mar 16 22:18:35 CST 2005

 - The html docs that were created during the first invokation of
   './Build' were being found and treated as pod that needed to be
   converted to html during subsequent invokations. We now are more
   specific about the directories we scan for pod that needs to be
   converted, effectively avoiding blib/html. [Ray Zimmerman]

 - If Pod::Man is not available, we now skip building man pages
   (rather than dying) and tell the user why.

 - We now write a .packlist file upon installation, in the same place
   that ExtUtils::MakeMaker does. [Johnny Lam]

 - On some Unix platforms (BSD derivatives, mostly) perl's $^X
   variable isn't set to the full path of the perl executable, just
   'perl', when the 'Build' script is run as './Build' and not 'perl
   ./Build'.  This can lead to some other modules (maybe
   Test::Harness, maybe IO::File, I dunno...) getting very confused
   about where they are, and they try to load stuff from the wrong
   perl lib, and big trouble ensues.  To fix this, we now set $^X to
   the value of Module::Build->find_perl_interpreter().

 - The 'distcheck' action will now die() if it finds an error in the
   MANIFEST, rather than just printing on STDOUT. [David Golden]

 - When the README and/or Makefile.PL are autogenerated using
   create_readme or create_makefile_pl, we now automatically make sure
   they're also listed in the MANIFEST file. [Suggested by Michael
   Schwern]

 - Got rid of the t/MANIFEST file - it's superfluous, and it had
   zero-length, which some versions of Tar don't like. [William
   Underwood]

 - Added a mention in the documentation that each property that new()
   accepts also has a corresponding get/set accessor.  (In the version
   0.27_0x series each accessor method is mentioned explicitly in the
   docs.) [Omission spotted by Ian Langworth]

0.2608  Wed Jan 26 19:46:09 CST 2005

 - Add workaround for test files because Devel::Cover causes
   require to fail when the argument to require is an expression
   involving File::Spec. We now assign the result of the File::Spec
   call to a variable and then call require with that variable.

 - Tilde-expansion is now performed on arguments passed to a
   compatibility-Makefile.PL [Spotted by Sam Vilain]

 - We now run the 'gzip' and 'tar' values through split_like_shell()
   when running the 'dist' action, so that e.g. the 'gzip' value can
   be set to something like "gzip -f --best" and it'll work
   correctly. [Spotted by Chris Dolan]

 - Work around some bad mojo between Fedora Core [with its very long
   @INC] and old versions of Test::Harness [with its propensity to
   compound the number of @INC entries] that produced an "argument
   list too long" error during testing.  [assisted by Ville Skytta,
   David Golden, & Randy Sims]

 - Killed an infinite loop that would happen in y_n() in interactive
   mode if the author provided no default value. [Max Maischein]

0.2607 (Bug fix release in 0.26 series)  Sat Dec 18 14:14:09 CST 2004

 - Instead of freezing @INC in the 'Build' script to the value it had
   when Build.PL was run, we now just add those additional values that
   aren't part of the default compiled-in @INC. [Michael Schwern]

 - The run_perl_script() method will now propagate any extra entries
   in @INC (such as those added by "use lib" or the -I command-line
   switch) to the subprocess.  This helps situations in which you want
   to tell the subprocess where to find a certain module, for
   instance.  [Michael Schwern]

0.2606 (Bug fix release in 0.26 series)   Tue Dec  7 22:33:11 CST 2004

 - Fixed a linking bug on Win32, in which compiled C code object files
   never got linked in with the modules being built. [Dominic
   Mitchell]

 - Fixed a bug in the new_from_context() method in which any arguments
   passed made us die. [Spotted by Jos Boumans]

0.2605 (Bug fix release in 0.26 series)   Tue Nov 30 07:16:13 CST 2004

 - Fixed a bug in which zero-length arguments for hash-valued
   parameters (e.g. " --config foo= ") weren't being allowed.

 - The tests now play better with environments in which version.pm is
   pre-loaded, like in bleadperl. [John Peacock & Michael Schwern]

 - Fixed a syntax error in one of the tests under perl 5.005.

0.2604 (Bug fix release in 0.26 series)   Wed Nov 17 14:32:42 CST 2004

 - Fixed a split_like_shell() bug introduced in 0.2603 for Windows, in
   which an array reference passed as an argument was returned as an
   array reference, rather than as a list. [Spotted by Steve Hay]

 - module_name() will now return '' instead of undef when module_name
   is not set.  This eliminates a couple uninitialized-value
   warnings. [Suggested by Michael Schwern]

 - The expand_test_dir() method will now skip dotfiles (like ._foo.t,
   which sometimes gets automatically created on Mac systems) when
   'recursive_test_files' is in effect. [Tom Insam]

0.2603 (Bug fix release in 0.26 series)   Mon Nov 15 10:28:00 CST 2004

 - Added documentation for the new_from_context() method.

 - Completely rewrote the split_like_shell() method for the Windows
   platform so it works like the command.com shell. [Randy Sims]

0.2602 (Bug fix release in 0.26 series)   Thu Nov  4 11:19:29 CST 2004

 - The two bug fixes in 0.2601 gnashed against each other incorrectly,
   resulting in a Win32 bug in split_like_shell().  Fixed.  [Spotted
   by Steve Hay & Randy Sims]

 - Removed a couple of 'use warnings' statements from the code - they
   were causing compile failures on 5.005_04, where warnings.pm isn't
   available. [Blair Zajac]

0.2601 (Bug fix release in 0.26 series)   Wed Nov  3 20:09:27 CST 2004

 - Fixed some backslash problems with split_like_shell() on
   Win32. [Steve Hay]

 - Fixed a bug in split_like_shell() in which leading whitespace was
   creating an empty word, manifesting as something like "gcc - no
   such file or directory" during tests. [Spotted by Warren L. Dodge]

0.26  Sat Oct  9 17:51:01 CDT 2004

 - Removed some language from the Module::Build::Compat documentation
   that encouraged people to include a Build.PL without a Makefile.PL.
   Also changed "a replacement for MakeMaker" to "an alternative to
   MakeMaker" in the main documentation, which is basically what I
   meant all along (i.e. a replacement for MakeMaker in your
   particular build process - MakeMaker is never going to be fully
   replaced in the perl world at large, of course), but some people
   got the impression I was a little more truculent toward MakeMaker
   than I really am.

 - Added the formal concepts of "features" and "config data" for
   distributions.  This allows the module author to define a certain
   set of features that the user can switch on and off (usually
   according to whether they have the proper prerequisites for them),
   and to save build-time configuration information in a standardized
   format.  See the main documentation of Module::Build for more
   details.  (Note that the name of this system was called
   "BuildConfig" for a while in beta, but now it's called
   "ConfigData".)

 - Added an 'auto_features' capability, which simplifies the process
   of defining features that depend on a set of prerequisites.

 - Added the 'get_options' parameter, which lets module authors
   declare certain command-line arguments their Build.PL can accept
   [David Wheeler]

 - Changed the split_like_shell() method to use the shellwords()
   function from Text::ParseWords (a core module since 5.0), which
   does a much better job than the split() we were using.

 - Added a 'testpod' action, which checks the syntactic validity of
   all POD files in the distribution using Test::Pod.  This eliminates
   the need for doing so in a regression test. [Initial patch by Mark
   Stosberg]

 - Added a process_files_by_extension() method, which generalizes the
   kind of processing (essentially just copying) that happens for .pm
   and .pod files, and makes it available to other user-defined types
   of files.  See the new cookbook entry.

 - Improved compatibility with version.pm when authors are using
   version objects as their $VERSION variables.  Now
   version_from_file() can deal with these objects.  Currently we
   stringify them right away, but perhaps in the future we will
   preserve them as objects for a while.

 - During 'distdir' and 'distmeta' actions, die a bit more gracefully
   if there's no MANIFEST (i.e. explicitly say that a MANIFEST is
   required). [Spotted by Adrian Howard]

 - Eliminated a recursive dependency between creating the MANIFEST
   file and creating the META.yml file.  [Spotted by Dave Rolsky]

 - On Win32, where a single directory might be known variously as
   "Module-Build-0.25_03" or "MODULE~1.25_", we now use
   Win32::GetShortPathName($cwd) to verify that the 'Build' script is
   being run from the correct directory, rather than just a string
   comparison.

 - The add_to_cleanup() method will now accept glob()-style patterns
   in addition to explicit filenames.  Also documented the fact that
   they can be specified in either Unix-style or native-style
   notation.

 - Passing a PREFIX value to a pass-through Makefile 'make install'
   now has the same effect as passing it to 'perl Makefile.PL' (it
   dies with a helpful message).

 - Added the 'testcover' action, which runs a test suite using
   Devel::Cover.  [Dave Rolsky]

 - Added the 'lib' and 'arch' installation directories to the search
   path for the 'diff' action, since they won't necessarily (though
   they usually will) be in @INC at installation time. [Suggested by
   Kevin Baker]

 - The "=head3" POD directive isn't supported in older podlators
   (particularly Pod::Man), so we don't use it anymore.

 - Fixed a typo & improved the docs in the SUBCLASSING section. [Ron
   Savage]

 - Added the '.tmp' suffix to the default MANIFEST.SKIP file, which
   should avoid adding things like pod2htmi.tmp to the MANIFEST [Ron
   Savage]

 - Backup files from Emacs, containing the string '.#' in their names,
   should no longer find their way into the blib/ directory (and from
   there into installation directories).

 - Worked around an unpleasant interaction between version.pm and the
   version-checking code that makes sure Module::Build's version
   hasn't changed during the lifetime of the 'Build' script. [Reported
   by Trevor Schellhorn]

 - Fixed a problem in htmlify_pods() that would produce test failures
   on Cygwin (and probably elsewhere).  [Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes]

 - Fixed a test failure on Cygwin (and probably elsewhere) in
   t/compat.t, resulting from empty environment variables being set to
   the empty string (as opposed to simply being unset) by their mere
   presence in the "EXPORT:" list.

 - Fixed a fatal error that occurred when the author specified
   'dist_author' manually in their Build.PL script. [Spotted by Ron
   Savage]

 - The 'provides' section of the META.yml file wasn't being built
   properly on Win32, because of a mismatch between URL-format and
   native-format pathnames.  Fixed.  [Reported by Robert Rothenberg]

 - The progress message "lib/Foo.xs -> lib/Foo.c" was previously being
   output even when the Foo.c file wasn't being rebuilt.  It's now
   fixed.

 - Fixed a couple of places in Compat.pm where it could have forgotten
   which perl interpreter it had been run with ($^X isn't very
   trustworthy).

 - On some systems, the way we updated the timestamp on the
   "lib/Foo.bs" file (one of the output files for XS-based modules)
   was failing.  It's been replaced by a simple call to utime().

 - Fixed a problem in t/compat.t that prevented it from being run
   individually using 'make test TEST_FILES=t/compat.t'.  The problem
   was that a couple environment variables (TEST_FILES, MAKEFLAGS)
   were being passed through to subprocesses, and confused them.

 - Fixed an important typo in the documentation for the 'install_base'
   parameter ('libdoc' and 'bindoc' were switched). [Ray Zimmerman]

 - The pass-through Makefiles (type 'small' or 'passthrough') now
   support the TEST_FILES parameter to 'make test'.

 - Fixed a fatal error that would occur on perl 5.005 when building
   HTML documentation, because its version of Pod::Html was old and
   didn't like some of the parameters we fed it. [Spotted by Blair
   Zajac]

 - The final line of the generated pass-through Makefile was missing
   its trailing newline, which is now fixed. [Chip Salzenberg]

 - We now depend on YAML version at least 0.35 and at most version
   0.49, so that we don't pick up a new (and backward-incompatible) beta
   version from CPAN.

 - Squashed a warning in t/basic.t about '"Foo::Module::VERSION" used
   only once', and one in PPMMaker about $^V being undefined. [Blair
   Zajac]

 - Added a couple temporary output files from HTML documentation
   generation to the cleanup list.  [Toby Ovod-Everett]

 - The PodParser module will now only extract paragraphs in the
   'AUTHOR' section of the pod if they contain an '@' character.  This
   tends to do a better job, heuristically speaking, of returning
   relevant stuff.

 - Added regression tests and a helper method ( add_build_elements() )
   for adding new elements to the build process.  Also some
   documentation.

 - Wrote a recipe in the Cookbook for adding new elements to the build
   process, and a recipe for changing the order in which the steps in
   the build process will occur.

0.25  Sun Apr 25 11:12:36 CDT 2004

 - During the 'distdir' action, if no MANIFEST.SKIP file exists, we
   will now create a reasonable default one. [Randy Sims]

 - In Makefile compatibility mode, some arguments (like UNINST,
   TEST_VERBOSE, etc.) given to 'make' are now recognized and passed
   through to Module::Build. [Randy Sims]

 - The regression tests now make sure that several pass-through
   Makefile.PL parameters are dealt with correctly.

 - Added support for the 'LIB' parameter to passthrough
   Makefile.PLs. [Spotted by Jesse Erlbaum]

 - Passing a 'PREFIX' parameter to a passthrough Makefile.PL was
   supposed to make it die with a helpful error message, but instead
   it just ignored it and blindly tried to install to the wrong place.
   This is now fixed.  [Spotted by Jesse Erlbaum]

 - Added an extra_compiler_flags() accessor method.

 - If the 'recursive_test_files' option was turned on, the test files
   weren't sorted, but returned in an apparently random order.  Now
   they're sorted.  [Martyn Peck]

 - Documented the 'tar' and 'gzip' parameters to the 'dist' and
   'ppmdist' actions.

 - The generation of HTML documentation now works (it was accidentally
   partially implemented with an itchy patch-application finger in
   0.24).  [Randy Kobes]

 - Fixed a fatal bug when building META.yml with YAML.pm and
   'dynamic_config' is set. [Reported by Jaap Karssenberg]

 - Fixed some incorrect error messages that occurred when
   compiling/linking C sources went awry.

 - If the author uses a custom builder subclass, that subclass will
   now be loaded correctly in the passthrough Makefile.PL if the
   author uses the 'small' or 'passthrough' Makefile.PL options in
   Module::Build::Compat. [Martyn Peck and Jaap Karssenberg]

 - If the author uses a custom builder subclass created dynamically
   through the subclass() method, passthrough Makefile.PLs (of type
   'passthrough' or 'small') didn't work properly, because the custom
   builder module wouldn't be loaded at the right time.  This has been
   fixed.  [Reported by Toby Ovod-Everett]

 - In M::B-generated 'traditional' Makefile.PLs, the entries in
   'PREREQ_PM' are now sorted ASCIIbetically rather than randomly.

 - The install_types() method will now return any additional types
   given as 'install_path' arguments, as well as all elements of the
   current 'install_sets' entry.  This makes it easier to add new
   types of installable objects to the mix.

 - As a consequence of the previous change, there is no longer any
   need to have an explicit 'install_types' data member, so it has
   been removed.

 - In the second example code for the Module::Build->subclass()
   method, the Module::Build module needed to be loaded before calling
   its methods. [John Peacock]

 - Fixed minor error in the POD structure of Module::Build and
   Module::Build::Platform::VMS docs.


0.24  Wed Feb 25 15:57:00 CST 2004

 - Fixed a problem with incude_dirs not being propagated to the 'ccs'
   file when compiling XS files on Win32. [Randy Sims and Steve Hay]

 - In 0.23, Module::Build::Compat->fake_makefile() started choking
   when no 'build_class' parameter was supplied in the Makefile.PL.
   Since these Makefile.PLs still exist on CPAN, we now default
   'build_class' to 'Module::Build', which was the old 0.22 behavior
   anyway.  [Reported by Martin Titz and Jeremy Seitz]

 - Added documentation for the 'include_dirs' parameter to
   new(). [Steve Hay]

 - Changed the no-op command on Win32 from 'rem' to 'rem>nul' inside
   pass-through Makefiles. [Randy Sims]

 - The 'autosplit' parameter now accepts an array reference if
   multiple files should be split. [Jaap Karssenberg]

 - find_perl_interpreter() will now use $^X (if absolute), $ENV{PATH}
   (if $^X isn't absolute), and $Config{perlpath}, in that order.
   Also, we now make darn sure the result is the same version of perl,
   by checking Config::myconfig() for a match against the current
   perl.  [Reported by Edward Sabol]

 - Fixed a fatal error on Win32 (and any other platform that doesn't
   define an installation location for Unix-style man pages) during
   installation.

0.23  Sun Feb  8 22:01:18 CST 2004

 - Fixed a compatibility problem in pass-through Makefiles (created by
   Module::Build::Compat).  Some 'make' utilities (for example, BSD
   make) didn't like a '@' by itself on a line, so we stole some
   'NOOP' code from MakeMaker to fix it. [Reported by Mathieu Arnold]

 - Added a 'ppm_dist' action, which just makes the PPD file and then
   makes a tarball out of the blib/ directory. [Randy Sims]

 - The @INC of the parent process is now propagated to child processes
   when processing *.PL files. [Reported by Jaap Karssenberg]

 - We now only attempt to fix the shebang line on a script if the
   shebang line matches the regex /perl/i .  This fixes some instances
   where people put shell scripts in their distributions. [Jaap
   Karssenberg]

 - We no longer generate a 'requires', 'recommends', 'conflicts',
   etc. entry in the META.yml file if there's no data to go in it.

 - Added a documentation reference to Michael Schwern's wiki for tips
   on conversion from MakeMaker to M::B. [Randy Sims]

 - If there are script_files, we now add EXE_FILES to the
   'traditional' Makefile.PL generated by M::B::Compat. [Suggested by
   Yuval Kogman]

 - Documented the 'test_files' parameter to new(). [Reported by Tony
   Bowden]

 - Fixed a problem in "Build help <action>", which didn't find the
   correct help chunk if <action> was the final element in a POD
   list. [Jaap Karssenberg]

 - Fixed a problem in the get_action_docs() method which gave
   incorrect results if the method was called more than once in the
   same program.

 - Fixed a problem in which actions defined by user subclasses
   wouldn't be available via the pass-through Makefiles created by
   Module::Build::Compat. [Reported by Jaap Karssenberg]

 - We now use Data::Dumper instead of our own ad-hoc serialization
   routines to create the 'traditional' Makefile.PL
   arguments. [Suggested by Yuval Kojman]

0.22  Sat Jan 10 22:05:39 CST 2004

 - On Unixish platforms, the syntax "FOO=BAR /bin/baz arg arg" now
   works when present in $Config{ld}.  This solves a problem on Mac OS
   X 10.3. [Reported by Adam Foxson]

 - The have_c_compiler() now also tests whether the linker seems to
   work too.

 - Fixed a problem with creating the distribution tarball in which
   permissions would usually be all read-only.  We now use our own
   file-copying routines rather than those in ExtUtils::Manifest,
   because those do some annoying extra permissions-setting stuff for
   no apparent reason.  It makes me happy that this was a very very
   easy patch to make.  [Reported by Thomas Klausner]

 - The compile_c() method now includes $Config{cccdlflags} in its
   command invocation.  It's usually empty, but not always, so we
   didn't notice for a while. [Richard Clamp]

 - On some platforms it's common to have a $Config{make} defined, but
   no 'make' utility actually available.  We now detect this and skip
   some 'make' compatibility tests. [Randy Sims]

 - Fixed a spurious testing failure on non-Unix platforms that
   happened because we accidentally call localize_file_path() on empty
   strings in the test suite. [Spotted by Randy Sims on Windows]

 - Made the 'name', 'abstract', 'author', and 'version' properties
   required when building a PPD file. [Spotted by Randy Sims, Dave
   Rolsky, & Glenn Linderman]

 - When building a 'traditional' Makefile.PL with
   Module::Build::Compat, we now use 'VERSION_FROM' when possible,
   rather than always using 'VERSION'.  This way the Makefile.PL
   doesn't have to get modified every release.

 - Made some fixups to the 'PPM' info-file, improving compatibility
   with ActiveState's PPM tools. [Randy Sims, Glenn Linderman]

 - The 'dist_author' property can now accept multiple authors, see the
   docs for more info. [Randy Sims]

 - If the user doesn't have YAML.pm installed during ACTION_dist, we
   now create a minimal YAML.pm anyway, without any dependency
   information.

 - The 'distribution_type' field is no longer created in META.yml
   files, in accordance with the finding made at the London CLPAN
   meeting that it's essentially meaningless and ill-defined.

 - The 'dist' action now accepts an optional 'tar' parameter to use a
   system utility for building the tarball, and a 'gzip' parameter for
   compressing it.  If these are used, Archive::Tar won't be invoked.
   This was added because Archive::Tar is producing some very
   non-cross-platform tarballs that many tar utilities can't handle.

 - During testing, if YAML.pm isn't installed, then we won't try
   making a tarball either, since this would invoke YAML to create the
   META.yml file.

 - Fixed a problem with chmod() being called incorrectly on MacOS
   (i.e. MacPerl, not Mac OS X).  [Spotted by Paul Sanford Toney]

 - Fixed a problem with the --config flag not being treated properly
   (essentially ignored) on the command line for 'perl Build.PL' or
   'Build <action>'. [Spotted by Jakub Bogusz]

 - Added a new config() method to get at the Build object's notion of
   the %Config hash.

 - Test::Harness is starting to contend for the Most Crotchety Module
   Award.  Work around a few of its nits when setting harness
   switches. [Spotted by Diab Jerius]

 - Now the Build script will die() if we're run from the wrong
   directory, rather than trying to chdir() to what it thinks is the
   right directory and do its work there.  See
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=4039 . [Chris Dolan]

 - Changed the manpage separator on OS/2 to '.'. [Ilya Zakharevich]

 - On OS/2, disable C compilation, since apparently it isn't working
   there. [Reported by Ilya Zakharevich]

 - Inserted a comment into auto-generated Makefile.PLs saying it was
   auto-generated. [Randy Sims]

 - Fixed some annoying behavior in generated passthrough Makefile.PLs
   when the user chose not to install Module::Build, or if
   installation failed. [Reported by Ilya Zakharevich and Richard
   Clamp]

 - Moved the documentation for 'codebase' to the section where it's
   relevant. [Randy Sims, Glenn Linderman]

 - Fixed a have_c_compiler() failure on some platforms, we now define
   a boot_compilet() function (since we're compiling a library, not an
   executable). [Randy Sims]

 - Added a recipe to the Module::Build::Cookbook describing how to
   maintain compatibility with older versions of CPAN.pm [Jim Cromie]

 - Removed caveat about "looking for alternatives" in how hashes are
   specified on the command line, since an alternative has been found.

 - Previously most warnings about optional prerequisites looked like
   they were actually error messages about required prerequisites.
   This has been corrected. [Reported again by Sagar Shah]

 - Added support for building XS (and C in general) stuff on AIX.
   This was done by a small reorganization of prelink_c() method from
   Windows.pm to Build.pm, and it is only invoked for the platforms
   that need it invoked.  AIX also massages some very naughty bits
   (MakeMaker macro variables) in $Config{lddlflags} that should never
   have been put there, but alas, they're there, so we find & resolve
   them.

 - Added OS/2 ($^O = 'os2') to the list of Unix-like platforms.  This
   basically means that most platform-specific operations will be done
   in a Unix-like manner.

 - Pass-through Makefiles will now die() when they're given a PREFIX
   parameter, and suggest using 'destdir' or 'install_base' instead.
   Previously they just ignored the parameter and tried to install to
   the default location, which is clearly not what the user wanted.

 - Updated my email address in the documentation to a more recent
   variant.

 - Add NetBSD to the list of Unix-like systems. [Adrian Bunk]

 - Add SVR5 to the list of Unix-like systems. [Rafael Garcia-Suarez]

 - We now use Pod::Parser to find the ABSTRACT and AUTHOR when it's
   available on the system. [initial patch by Randy Sims]

 - Fixed a little scalar/list buglet in a documentation example.

0.21  Wed Oct 15 20:47:05 CDT 2003

 - Added a have_c_compiler() method.

 - Added documentation for the requires(), recommends(),
   build_requires(), and conflicts() methods.

 - On Unix platforms, we now create the "Build" script with a #! line
   matching the perl interpreter that was used to invoke the Build.PL
   script, rather than whatever is in $Config{startperl}.  This avoids
   a potential warning about the interpreters not matching. [Spotted
   by Ken Y. Clark]

 - The Unix version now uses the safer multi-argument form of system()
   when building distribution tarballs.

 - Added a regression test for the 'dist' action to the t/runthrough.t
   test.

 - Fixed a problem with File::Spec usage when creating the names of
   'libdoc' manual pages - the code wasn't dealing with the volume or
   file portions correctly on certain platforms.

 - When creating the names of the 'libdoc' manual pages, we no longer
   assume that pods are under the hard-coded paths 'blib/lib' or
   'blib/arch'.

 - Fixed a crashing bug that could sometimes occur when the
   distribution contained no 'lib' directory. [Chris Dolan]

 - Fixed a crashing bug that happened when the user had .PL files in
   the lib/ directory and didn't explicitly name them in a hash
   reference to the new() constructor. [Chris Reinhardt, bug #4036]

 - .PL files are now passed the names of their target file(s) on the
   command line when they run.

 - When YAML.pm wasn't installed, t/runthrough.t wasn't properly
   skipping some tests that required YAML.  This is now fixed.
   [Stephen J. Smith]

 - Added documentation for the dist_version() and dist_name()
   methods. [Spotted by Johan Vromans]

 - Existing values in $ENV{HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES} are now respected
   and not squashed when we run the 'test' action. [Paul Johnson]

 - On cygwin, the separator string for manual page names has been set
   to '.'.  Previously it was '::', inherited from Unix. [Yitzchak
   Scott-Thoennes]

 - Avoid a warning when Build.PL is run (i.e. when the new() method is
   called) and no MANIFEST file exists. [Michael Schwern and Kevin
   Ruscoe]

 - Added documentation for the 'code' and 'docs' actions. [Steve
   Purkis and Mark Stosberg]

 - The internal method compile_support_files() has been renamed to
   process_support_files() in order to make it consistent with other
   processing methods.  Note that it was never documented using the
   old name.  It's still not documented, actually.  Maybe later.

 - Skip the 'write' pseudo-entry in the 'diff' action's installation
   map. [Chris Dolan]

 - Fixed a bug in which notes() set in the Build.PL before
   create_build_script() was called would get lost unless more notes()
   were also set afterwards. [Spotted by Dave Rolsky]

 - The process of building elements of the distribution is now driven
   by a list of build elements, paving the way for letting people add
   their own types of build elements in future versions of
   Module::Build (or in the current version with some difficulty).

 - Fixed some linking errors on Cygwin. [Randy Sims, Terrence Brannon]

 - Fixed a line-ending problem with detecting the dist_abstract
   properly on Cygwin. [Randy Sims]

 - Fixed a problem with signatures that occurred if 'distsign' was
   called before 'distdir' - the signature would be generated twice.

 - Added a 'create_readme' parameter to new(), which will use
   Pod::Text to generate a README from the main (dist_version_from)
   module file during the 'distdir' action.

 - We now refuse to run the 'Build' script if it was created using a
   different version of Module::Build.  This has caused a couple of
   nasty bugs in the past, I don't want to know what it would cause in
   the future.

 - Documentation for do_system() has been added. [Dave Rolsky]

 - run_perl_script() is now available as a class method, though it
   will need to (re-)find the perl interpreter in this case.

 - Added a new_from_context() method that authors of automated tools
   like CPANPLUS and CPAN can use instead of running all tasks as
   sub-processes.  We also use it in the regression tests for
   Module::Build itself.  ** Note that this method is currently
   undocumented because its name may change in the future. **

 - When signing distributions with Module::Signature, we now
   automatically add the SIGNATURE file to the MANIFEST, avoiding an
   unpleasant chicken/egg problem for the module author.
   [unpleasantness spotted by sungo]

 - In Module::Build::Compat, added support for the 'verbose' parameter
   to Makefile.PL [spotted by Soren Andersen, fixed by Michael
   Schwern]

 - The Module::Build distribution now has a cryptographic 'SIGNATURE'
   file created by Module::Signature.

 - Added proper documentation for the subclass() method. [spotted by
   Jonathan Steinert]

 - Worked around a Config.pm bug in Red Hat 9 which prevented man
   pages from being installed in the correct places. [spotted by Ville
   Skytta]

 - Fixed a Module::Build::Compat bug in which setting INSTALLDIRS
   caused a crash. [spotted by Ilya Martynov]

0.20  Tue Aug 26 14:34:07 CDT 2003

 - Separated the 'build' action into two separate actions, 'code' and
   'docs'.  This is similar to MakeMaker's separation of the 'all'
   target into 'pure_all' and 'manifypods'.  This fixes a permissions
   hassle in which doing 'sudo Build install' would often create local
   doc files that needed superuser permissions to delete.

 - Enhanced the 'help' action - 'Build help foo' will now show the POD
   documentation for the 'foo' action.

 - Added a notes() feature, which helps share data transparently
   between the Build.PL and t/*.t scripts.

 - The installation process will now create man(1) and man(3) pages
   from POD in modules & scripts, and install them.  We don't build
   man pages when there's nowhere to install them, such as on some
   Win32 or most Mac systems.  [large patch by Steve Purkis, 5.005 fix
   by Mathieu Arnold]

 - The 'distdir' action now copies files to the distribution
   directory, rather than making them hard links to the original
   files.  This allows authors to do last-minute alterations of the
   files without affecting the originals. [Dave Rolsky]

 - If the author uses XS files in nonstandard locations, the copied
   versions of those files will now be cleaned up properly.

 - In invoking the 'test' action or invoking 'xsubpp', we now use the
   same perl executable as we use everywhere else, rather than blindly
   using $^X or $Config{perlpath} (neither of which are very
   reliable).

 - Fixed a problem with the 'install_path' parameter given to
   'Build.PL' being lost in subsequent actions. [Reported by Mathieu
   Arnold]

 - Fixed yet another bug with installation directories, in which the
   'install_base' parameter wasn't being respected on the command
   line.  [Spotted by Jonathan Swartz]

 - Changed the way the depends_on() method works inside action
   subroutines - now each action will only run once per dispatch()
   invocation (similar to how perl's require() function works).  This
   helps avoid some difficult problems with dependency loops.

 - Changed the documentation for the 'autosplit' parameter to give
   reasons why it may not be a good idea to use, but no longer
   threaten to remove it.  [Suggested by Martyn J. Pearce]

 - Improved the formatting of the 'traditional' Makefile.PL generated
   by Module::Build::Compat->create_makefile_pl. [Michael Schwern]

 - The 'traditional' Makefile.PL will now use the 'module_name'
   parameter (as NAME) if it's available, otherwise it will continue
   to use the 'dist_name' (as DISTNAME). [Michael Schwern]

 - Created read/write accessor methods for all our 'properties'.
   [Michael Schwern]

 - The 'test_files' parameter can now be specified using glob() syntax
   (i.e. 't/*.t'), and the corresponding test_files() method is now a
   read/write accessor.

 - The location of the 'blib' directory is now a property of the Build
   object - nobody is likely to notice this change, with any luck, but
   it makes the design and code cleaner.

 - The 'disttest' and 'distsign' methods now chdir() back to the
   directory where they started, rather than to the base_dir of the
   build.

 - Improved comparisons of version strings containing underscore
   characters (indicating "beta" status). [Steve Purkis]

 - Added documentation for the 'dist_author', 'dist_abstract', and
   'codebase' parameters to new(), and for the 'ppd' action. [Dave
   Rolsky]

 - Added documentation for the up_to_date() and contains_pod()
   methods. [Dave Rolsky]

 - 'traditional' pass-through Makefile.PLs will now contain an
   INSTALLDIRS parameter matching the Build.PL's 'installdirs'
   setting.

 - version_from_file() now ignores $VERSION variables that are defined
   in POD or comments.  It can still be tricked by $VERSIONs in string
   literals, though.  [Steve Purkis]

 - The code to find packages in module files now uses Steve's scanning
   method (above) to skip package-declaration-lookalikes in POD or
   comments.

 - The 'disttest' action will now propagate its @INC settings to its
   subprocesses.

0.19  Wed Jul  9 22:34:02 CDT 2003

 - Added support for the 'install_path' parameter, which allows custom
   specification of where things should be installed.  This is a major
   improvement to Module::Build's functionality.

 - Added the 'install_base' parameter.  Provides an easy way to
   install to local or alternative directory trees.

 - We now install scripts by default to $Config{installsitebin}
   instead of $Config{installscript}.  Neither is a great choice, but
   the former is likely to be [analogous to] /usr/local/bin, and the
   latter is likely to be [something like] /usr/bin .  If/when there's
   a $Config{installsitescript}, we'll start using that automatically.

 - Fixed a problem on Win32 in which C and XS files wouldn't be
   compiled properly, and the user would see an error about 'Can't
   locate object method "format_compiler_cmd"'.
   (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2391)

 - We now use the correct perl interpreter (via
   Module::Build->find_perl_interpreter) in pass-through makefiles.

 - The t/compat.t test now uses $Config{make} instead of just 'make'
   to test makefile compatibility.  This fixes some failures on Win32.
   We also skip this test entirely if no make utility is available.

 - Alternative distribution layouts are now supported via the
   'pm_files', 'pod_files', 'xs_files', 'PL_files', and 'script_files'
   parameters to new().  This should help people transition from
   MakeMaker, and might even help us write an automatic transition
   tool.

 - Added tests to t/runthrough.t that check to see installation is
   happening correctly.

 - Added experimental code to build a .ppd file, in support of
   ActiveState's "Perl Package Manager". [original patch by Dave
   Rolsky]

 - For authors who use Module::Signature to sign their distributions,
   we now create the SIGNATURE file right in the distribution
   directory, rather than creating it in the top-level directory and
   copying it into place.  This solves problems related to having
   files get out of date with respect to their signatures.

 - We now don't depend on Module::Info to scan for packages during the
   'dist' action anymore, because it's way too aggressive about
   loading other modules that you may not want loaded.  We now just
   (ick, yuck) scan the .pm files with a regular expression to find
   "package Foo::Bar;" statements.

 - Silenced some annoying copyright/logo output from Microsoft 'nmake'
   during Makefile compatibility testing. [Randy W. Sims]

 - Command-line arguments may now either be specified using the syntax
   '--foo foovalue' as well as the traditional syntax 'foo=foovalue'.
   The former is often more convenient for shell tab-completion when
   the value is a filename (as in 'Build test --test_files t/basic.t').

 - Command-line arguments may now include non-named parameters, which
   make some actions more natural.  For instance, the 'diff' action
   may now be invoked as 'Build diff -u' rather than as
   'Build diff flags=-u'.

 - Pass-through Makefile.PLs now convert unknown Makefile.PL
   parameters to lower-case and hand them to Build.PL, rather than
   ignoring them.  This means we only have to account for the
   differences in the interface, not the entire interface, in
   translating parameters.

 - We now issue a warning & don't proceed if asked to make a distdir
   and there's no MANIFEST or it's empty.

 - Moved INSTALL to INSTALL.txt to increase compatibility with various
   odd versions of 'make' during 'make install' on case-insensitive
   filesystems (like nmake on Win32, often).  Only affects the
   Makefile compatibility layer.  [reported by Andrew Savige]

 - Module::Build->known_actions() now works as a class method.

 - Pass-through makefiles now list each action individually rather
   than using a ".DEFAULT" catch-all.  This improves compatibility
   with 'nmake' on Win32, and probably some other less common 'make'
   dialects.  [Andrew Savige]

 - We're now more aggressive about testing the pass-through makefiles,
   e.g. making sure they can run 'all' and 'test' targets, and making
   sure the Makefile itself actually exists.

 - Fixed a problem with check_installed_status() when installed
   version contains non-numeric characters like underscores.

 - Fixed a problem with a bareword 'File::Spec' in one of the test
   scripts that caused it not to compile under 5.8.0 (but is fine
   under 5.6).

 - Fixed a problem with the 'destdir' installation parameter on
   platforms that have volume identifiers in path names (like "C:" on
   Win32).  The identifier is now stripped from installation
   directories before prepending the destdir path.  The destdir path
   may still have a volume identifier on it.

 - Added an 'add_to_cleanup' parameter to new() that calls
   add_to_cleanup() immediately for the given files.

 - The distribution directory (e.g. Sample-Module-0.13/ ) will now be
   deleted during the 'clean' or 'realclean' actions.

 - During testing of modules, blib/lib and blib/arch are now added as
   absolute paths, not relative.  This helps tests that load the
   modules at runtime and may change the current working directory
   (like Module::Build itself does during testing).

 - The $Config{cc} entry on some people's systems is something like
   'ccache gcc', so we now split that string using split_like_shell().
   [Richard Clamp]

 - Added documentation for 'extra_linker_flags' parameter, and added a
   corresponding 'extra_compiler_flags' parameter. [original patch by
   Richard Clamp]

 - The pass-through Makefile created by Module::Build::Compat now
   supports MakeMaker options like POLLUTE=1 and INC.  We also just
   warn & skip when we see any unknown MM parameters, rather than
   dying.  [Dave Rolsky]

 - Fixed an error about how @INC and $ENV{PERL5LIB} interact during
   the testing of M::B itself. [jk <billy2000@fastmail.fm>]

 - The pass-through Makefile doesn't include 'recommended' M::B
   dependencies in the Makefile anymore, since they're not strictly
   necessary.  In particular, this makes installing M::B itself
   easier.

 - A new 'create_makefile_pl' parameter lets you use
   Module::Build::Compat during the 'distdir' (or 'dist') action to
   automatically create a Makefile.PL for compatibility with
   ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  The parameter's value should be one of the
   styles named in the Module::Build::Compat documentation.

 - When compiling C code, we now respect 'pollute' and 'inc'
   parameters. (XXX - needs docs) [Dave Rolsky]

 - Made the creation of the "install map" more generic.  (XXX - needs
   documentation)

 - Fixed a problem in which add_to_cleanup() didn't note cleanup files
   unless create_build_script() had been called already. [Dave Rolsky]

 - During 'Build dist', we no longer have to load each .pm file (via
   Module::Info) to determine the $VERSION numbers inside.  Instead,
   we call our internal version_from_file() method, which is the same
   thing MakeMaker and PAUSE and search.cpan.org do.  Also fixes a
   failure when Module::Info is installed in a nonstandard directory.
   [reported by Teun Burgers]

 - Fixed some failing test code on Windows - open files can't be
   deleted. [Andrew Savige]

 - The Cygwin platform is now treated as a flavor of Unix rather than
   a flavor of Windows. [chocolateboy]

 - We're now more aggressive about adding temporary C compilation
   files (*.c, *.bs) to the cleanup list. [Dave Rolsky]

 - When constructing the list in META.yml of packages provided by this
   distribution, we now use the same rules as the PAUSE scanner does
   when a single .pm file contains multiple VERSIONs.  [Andreas Koenig]

 - check_installed_status() now works as both a class method and an
   object method (and is documented so).  [Spotted by Dave Rolsky]

0.18  Tue Apr  8 13:24:23 CDT 2003

 - We now rewrite the shebang lines of scripts ourselves, rather than
   relying on MakeMaker routines to do it.  MakeMaker changed the way
   this happened (not the result, but where the code lived) a few
   times.  [Suggested by Richard Clamp]

 - The scripts() method has changed to script_files(), and likewise
   the 'scripts' parameter has changed to 'script_files'.  The old
   names can still be used for backward compatibility.

 - Support for the 'scripts' parameter (which is now 'script_files')
   was broken in 0.17, now it's fixed.  [Richard Clamp]

 - We now recommend ExtUtils::ParseXS 2.02, which will fail to load
   with perl 5.005 or earlier (which is proper, because it doesn't
   work with those versions).  When it fails to load, we still fall
   back to using the xsubpp script for XS parsing. [spotted by Dave
   Rolsky, fix suggested by Richard Clamp]

 - Now works on VMS - the Build script's shebang-line-equivalent
   wasn't being formed correctly there - though just about everything
   else worked fine.  [Tested & patched by Michael Schwern]

 - Eliminated a warning that occurred if 'perl Build.PL' or the
   check_installed_status() method was run with -w.  [Spotted by
   Michael Schwern]

0.17  Sat Mar 29 18:06:01 CST 2003

 - Now works under perl 5.005_03.  [Richard Clamp]

 - When building blib/ , .PL files are now processed before doing
   anything else.  This means .PL files can be used in any of the
   other contexts.

 - The locating and processing of .pm, .pod, .xs, .PL files and script
   files are now isolated into their own methods.  This is aimed
   toward providing a stable interface for this stuff, so they can be
   overridden, parameterized, etc.  They're not quite stable yet,
   though.

 - The internal lib_to_blib() method has gone away, because processing
   is now done by smaller specialized methods.  This method had some
   duplicate assumptions about filenames that it's nice to get rid of.

 - .PL files are no longer automatically processed in the c_source
   directory, they must be specified manually in a 'PL_files'
   parameter.

 - Mention in the docs that it's useful to do "PL_FILES => {}" in a
   Makefile.PL if you're using both a Makefile.PL and a
   Build.PL. [Dom]

 - Add several options to the 'license' field, so that we're in better
   sync with PAUSE and CPAN options. [Andreas Koenig]

 - Created a find_perl_interpreter() method that tries to locate the
   currently executing perl interpreter.  Following a suggestion from
   Nicholas Clark <nick@ccl4.org> for Inline, we prefer an absolute
   path in $^X, then an existent path in $Config{perlpath}, then
   whatever's in $^X.

 - Use the aforementioned perl to run scripts in run_perl_script().
   This fixes the spurious warning "WARNING: Configuration was
   initially created with 'foo', but we are now using 'bar'" that
   appeared a lot in version 0.16.


0.16  Mon Feb 24 13:06:47 CST 2003

 - All three C compilers that perl supports on Windows environments
   (MSVC, BCC, and GCC) are now supported by Module::Build.  We now
   reportedly pass all tests on Windows.  [Randy W. Sims]

 - The test t/xs.t, which tests building of XS modules, will be
   skipped if no C compiler is found. [suggested by Randy W. Sims]

 - The "install" action accepts new "destdir" [motivated by Michael
   Schwern and Chip Salzenberg] and "uninst" parameters [by Dave
   Rolsky].  The former prepends an arbitrary directory to all
   installation paths (useful for package management), and the latter
   will tell ExtUtils::Install to remove any differing files that are
   "shadowing" the stuff you're installing from a different location,
   just like MakeMaker's "make install UNINST=1" command will do.

 - Made changes to the generated Makefile in Module::Build::Compat
   that much better support Windows platforms [after suggestions by
   James Freeman]

 - Added experimental support for creating distribution SIGNATURE
   files via Module::Signature. [Dave Rolsky]

 - Added experimental support for installing via the "only.pm" module,
   which allows loading specific versions of modules.  Since this
   module is so new, the interface may still be changing. [Brian
   Ingerson]

 - Added support for installing executable scripts, via the 'scripts'
   parameter to new(), and the scripts() accessor method.

 - Fix an infinite loop that occurred when doing 'perl Build.PL
   config="foo=bar"'

 - Fix up the formatting of the error message the user gets when
   prereqs aren't satisfied.

0.15  Fri Jan 17 15:00:24 CST 2003

 - In link_c(), extra object files were mistakenly being treated as
   output files, not input files, in the up-to-date check.  Fixed.

 - In up_to_date(), don't make an unnecessary copy of the file lists
   when they're specified as array references.

 - Split off the C compilation phase into its own method,
   compile_support_files(), for easier subclassing.

 - Start a stub of a 'manifypods' action.

 - Compiler optimizations weren't being included in C compilation
   statements.  Fixed.

 - The 'extra_linker_flags' parameter wasn't being honored.  Fixed.

 - The 'ccflags' Config.pm entry wasn't being properly split into
   separate arguments.  Fixed.


0.14  Fri Dec 13 14:06:29 AEST 2002

  - Added support for MacPerl (Mac OS version 9 and below), which (as
    far as I know) was never natively supported by MakeMaker.  Still
    lacks support for the 'test' action (because Test::Harness
    requires forking, which MacPerl won't do) and compiling XS/C files
    (because I don't know how to invoke a compiler on MacOS, and one
    may not even be available).  This change is brought to you by
    Michael Schwern and the letter '('.

  - Improved processing of .xs files.  Now we use the new
    ExtUtils::ParseXS module if it's available, otherwise we use
    backticks and write the result to a .c file ourselves.  This
    avoids the need to do cross-platform shell redirection.

  - Make sure all parts of 'Build test' use the not-yet-installed
    version of Module::Build.  This only affects the tests for this
    module, not any of the module code itself.  [Spotted by Schwern]

  - Oopsie - use $Config{ld} instead of $Config{cc} for linking.

  - Added a 'diff' action, which is useful for comparing the details
    of what you're about to install with what is already installed on
    your system.  This uses File::Compare, which is in the core.

  - Fixed a problem on Windows in which the _build/ directory wasn't
    getting deleted during the 'realclean' action, because we had a
    file open in that directory. [Spotted by Michael Schwern]

  - delete_filetree() now always uses File::Path::rmtree(), regardless
    of whether the thing being deleted is a file or a directory.  This
    helps remove things on obscure platforms with strange locking
    rules (or even not so obscure ones like MacOS).  It also now
    reports the number of files or directories deleted (without
    recursing directory contents).

  - rm_previous_build_script() is gone, replaced by calls to
    delete_filetree().

  - 'Build' now chdir()s in a BEGIN block, so the 'use Module::Build'
    statement will work correctly.  Solves a problem on MacOS, where
    the 'Build' script may often be invoked from the wrong working
    directory.  [Fix by Michael Schwern]

  - Internally we now use the multi-argument form of system() to run
    external commands (such as 'diff' or 'cc') whenever possible (and
    whenever we can't avoid system() altogether).  Note that this
    means we have to handle splitting some strings (such as
    $Config{ccflags}) into argument lists like the shell would, which
    is a drag.  However, the alternative would be to handle shell
    quoting of all arguments to commands ourselves, which is an even
    bigger drag across platforms and involves arbitrary filenames and
    so on.

  - To handle the argument splitting mentioned above, a method
    split_like_shell() has been created.  So far it's just doing naive
    processing.  In practice, I've yet to actually see a %Config entry
    that uses quotes & spaces, so the splitting task is usually not
    very error-prone.

  - The 'test' action now takes a 'test_files' parameter, similar to
    the (undocumented) ExtUtils::MakeMaker TEST_FILES argument.  Handy
    during development when fixing bugs.

  - Internally, the rscan_dir() method can now accept a predicate
    function that decides whether a file/directory should be matched.

  - We now issue a warning message when the author hasn't specified a
    license type.

  - 'cleanup' file lists are now written immediately, rather than at
    program termination.  This helps avoid "phantom files" that don't
    get handled by the 'realclean' action.  The internal
    write_cleanup() method (which was never documented) is now gone.

  - The 'blib/' directory is now properly cleaned up in more (all?)
    circumstances.  Previously it could become a phantom if
    create_build_script() was never called.

  - Now scan the 'c_source' directory for .cpp (C++) files as well as
    .c files, and compiles them.

  - Use a 'phony' target for 'make manifest' in the pass-through
    Makefile, for the same reason as 'make install' (see version 0.12
    notes below).

  - Module::Build::Compat now accepts any known Config.pm key and
    passes it through to the Build.PL.  Fixes a problem with CPANPLUS,
    which was passing INSTALLMAN1DIR.

  - The file 'META.yaml' has been re-named to 'META.yml' in order to
    cooperate better with systems that can only handle 3 characters
    after the dot.

  - The t/xs.t test should give more informative error messages upon
    failure.

  - The META.yaml file was erroneously looking for 'build_depends'
    instead of 'build_requires'. [spotted by Iain Truskett]

  - Add prompt() and y_n() methods for use in Build.PLs

  - Do more to work with all versions of Test::Harness when setting
    the TEST_VERBOSE flag and running under the debugger [patch by
    Dave Rolsky]

  - Include a test for verbosity handling

  - Make sure the blib/ directory is always cleaned up with the
    'clean' or 'realclean' action.

  - In a pass-through Makefile.PL, inform 'make' that 'install' is a
    "fake target", so that it works properly on case-insensitive
    filesystems like HFS+ with distributions that contain an INSTALL
    file. [patch by Brian Ingerson]

  - In Module::Build::Compat, show an example Makefile.PL that can
    install Module::Build and re-invoke itself in one fell swoop [Dave
    Rolsky and Autrijus Tang]

  - Improve the formatting of the Module::Build and
    Module::Build::Compat documentation.

0.11  Fri Aug 23 18:50:46 AEST 2002

  - 'module_version' and 'module_version_from' have been replaced by
    'dist_version' and 'dist_version_from', which is what they really
    meant in the first place.  'dist_name' has been added.

  - 'module_name' is now just a way to set 'dist_name' and
    'dist_version_from' in a convenient way.

  - The 'name' in META.yaml is now the distribution name, not the
    (incorrect) module name. [spotted by Graham Barr]

  - Added the check_installed_status() and prereq_failures() methods
    for checking prerequisite information with the programmatic
    interface

  - check_installed_version() now uses check_installed_status()
    internally

  - Documented the create_build_script() method, which had escaped
    documentation.

  - create_build_script() now writes prerequisite information to the
    _build/ directory, for use by Module::Build::Compat.

  - Module::Build::Compat has documentation for a safer way to write a
    dummy Makefile.PL. [patch by Autrijus Tang]

0.10  Wed Aug  7 19:36 2002
  - Recommend YAML 0.35 instead of 0.30.

  - Don't die during 'Build disttest' if YAML isn't installed.  This
    fixes tests 5-10 in runthrough.t if YAML isn't installed.

  - Die if an unknown license type is used, but still default to
    'unknown' if no license is specified.

  - Use YAML::DumpFile() if we're using a recent YAML,
    YAML::StoreFile() otherwise.

  - Show specific error messages in runthrough.t.

  - Add a generated_by entry to the META.yaml file.

  - Skip a few tests if YAML isn't installed.

  - The 'distdir' action wasn't deleting the distribution directory
    before building it again.  This meant that, say, if you did 'Build
    disttest' then 'Build dist', you'd end up with a blib/ directory
    in your distribution.  I actually had this happen for version
    0.08, and it's not nice to distribute a blib/ on CPAN.

  - We now keep track of the 'base_dir', i.e. the top-level build
    directory, so we can change back into it if we change out of it.
    This necessitated a cwd() method, which uses the Cwd.pm module.
    I'm aware of Cwd's limitations, particularly under taint-mode, but
    I don't know a way around using it here.

  - The 'dist_dir' action now changes back into 'base_dir' directory.

  - We now do write_config() inside the create_build_script() method,
    not inside the new() method.

  - Simplified the find_version() method, and improved its error
    messages.

  - Renamed module_name_to_file() to find_module_by_name(), and added
    a parameter specifying the directories to search in.  Previously
    we searched in 'lib' and @INC, which wasn't correct in all
    situations.

  - Patched the docs to change "Build test" to "./Build test"
    [Elizabeth Mattijsen]

0.08  Wed Jun 26 20:30:56 EST 2002

  - Fixed the 'prereq' alias for the 'requires' parameter

  - Added some tests in t/basic.t to test the dependency checking

  - Added 'artistic' as a licensing option [Arthur Bergman]

  - Fixed some bugs in requires/prereq/recommends/conflicts/build_depends

  - Fixed a typo in the 'distclean' action that prevented its
    execution [Arthur Bergman]

  - Separated the linking phase of building XS items into its own
    link_c() method.  Its interface is still unstable, so it's not
    documented yet. [suggested by Arthur Bergman]

0.07  Jun  9 2002 15:46

  - We now generate a 'META.yaml' metadata file during 'Build dist'.
    This can be very useful for lots of things, none of which are
    implemented yet.

  - Added a 'dynamic_config' parameter, defaulting to false.  This
    lets distribution systems (CPAN.pm, etc.) build, test, and install
    "easy" modules without having to execute the Build.PL at runtime.
    It's also a guarantee that the list of dependencies is exactly
    what is present in the metadata file, and won't be changed during
    the build process.

  - Added support for "recommended" and "build-time requirement"
    modules, besides those that are absolutely required.  Also added a
    "conflicts" field.

  - Changed the 'prereq' field to 'requires' (the old name will
    continue to work).

  - Added support for checking the installed version of perl as an
    explicit dependency.

  - Added a 'license' parameter to specify one of a fixed number of
    licenses for the distribution.

  - Fixed a bug in Module::Build::Compat that was preventing arguments
    from being processed properly. [patch by Ilya Martynov]

  - Make sure we're in the right directory when we write the cleanup
    file, since various ExtUtils::Install errors might leave us in an
    unknown directory. [patch by Ilya Martynov]

  - Specified the 'license', 'recommends', and 'dynamic_config'
    values in Build.PL, and changed 'prereq' to 'requires'.

0.06  Apr 2 2002 17:44

  - Added the Module::Build::Compat module for assisting and
    explaining compatibility with ExtUtils::Makemaker and cohorts.

  - State is now saved using Data::Dumper instead of my ad-hoc
    mechanism, guaranteeing data integrity.  Whitespace values broke
    in the former scheme.

  - Added the 'recommended' option, which works like 'prereq' but
    isn't insistent.

  - Separated the various parameters into three groups: parameters
    that tell Module::Build what to do, Config.pm parameters, and
    user-defined parameters for each build (the module author is the
    'user' here).  This helps avoid conflicts between names, and it
    was silly to have them all together.  The three groups of
    parameters are subject to the same rules for overriding: values
    specified during a Build action take precedence over values
    specified at 'perl Build.PL' time, which in turn take precedence
    over values specified in the call to new().

  - Improved support for .PL files.  Any .PL file in the lib/
    directory or the directory specified by 'c_source' will now get
    properly executed.  I also added a 'PL_files' parameter that you
    can use in case the .PL doesn't create an obviously-named output
    file.

  - If a prerequisite condition is malformed, we now report a prereq
    failure and say why.  Previously we issued a warning and kept
    going.


0.05   10-Jan-2002 20:26
  - Added the Module::Build->subclass() method, which makes it easier to
    make quick-and-dirty subclasses of Module::Build.

  - Reorganized the docs a bit.

  - Added the 'testdb' action, and the 'debugger=1' argument to the
    'test' action, both of which run tests under the perl
    debugger. (idea: Dave Rolsky)

  - Added prerequisite checking (Dave Rolsky)

  - Fixed an unlikely-to-occur bug with misquoted strings in the
    'Build' script (spot: Dave Rolsky)

  - We're more careful about shush-ing warnings that
    ExtUtils::Manifest might emit (Dave Rolsky)

  - The 'help' action now auto-generates the list of actions (Dave Rolsky)

  - Added the 'distcheck', 'skipcheck', 'distclean', 'distdir', and
    'disttest' actions (Dave Rolsky)

  - We're a little more aggressive about cleaning up temporary files -
    we'll try to clean them up even when we don't have write permission
    on them.  This isn't as dastardly as it sounds; if we /really/
    don't have permission, we won't be able to remove them no matter
    how hard we try.

0.04   Fri Nov 16 16:55 2001
  - Added a 'manifest' action.  It's just like MakeMaker's 'make manifest', it
    brings your MANIFEST file up to date with your distribution directory.

  - Reorganized some of the responsibilities of various methods, which
    allows modules to be built and tested programmatically.

  - The 'clean' action will now clean up files that were created more
    recently than the on-disk cleanup registry was written.

  - Undefined values from Config.pm are handled correctly now.

  - The dispatch() method will now accept explicit dispatch
    parameters, for use in a programmatic setting.

  - $ENV{TEST_VERBOSE} will be set in test scripts if the 'verbose=1'
    parameter is set.

  - Moved the test.pl script to t/basic.t

  - Created the t/xs.t script, which tests building a module with a
    .xs component.

  - Fixed the loading of $^O-specific modules (there were no such
    modules before).

  - Added a 'darwin' platform module, which removes -flat_namespace
    from $Config{ccflags} while building .xs modules (it's a linker
    flag, not a compiler flag).

  - Now uses $^W instead of the 'warnings' pragma, which apparently
    provides compatibility with perl 5.005 (I've only tested it with
    5.6.x myself).

  - If a file called C<visual.pl> exists in the top-level directory,
    this file will be executed as a Perl script during 'Build test' and
    its output will be shown to the user.  This is a good place to put
    speed tests or other tests that don't use the C<Test::Harness> format
    for output.

  - The 'Build install' step will now put .xs-related things in the
    correct architecture-dependent libraries.

  - Added the 'autosplit' option, even though I think autosplitting is
    a load of hooie.

0.03  Sun Nov 11 14:58 CDT 2001
  - The 'perl Build.PL' step will now detect whether the current
    environment is "unixish", "windowsish", etc., and load the correct
    module (i.e. Module::Build::Platform::Unix).  More specific
    modules may also be written for particular values of $^O.

  - Module::Build will now process any .xs files in the lib/
    directory.  Please let me know whether this works or not with your
    distribution & platform.  I'll be trying out various distributions
    on my platform.

  - Corrected some embarassing errors in the POD documentation.  Also
    added a long documentation section on the various build actions
    (test, install, build, etc.) and added some neato ASCII art.

  - Added a 'cleanup' mechanism - any method may call the
    $self->add_to_cleanup(@files) method to register files which need
    to be cleaned up during 'Build clean'.

  - Added a 'Build help' action that gives a little syntax help, and
    lists all the actions available.

  - Fixed a bug in which 'blib/' wasn't properly being added to @INC
    when running 'Build test'.

  - For the 'Build dist' action, we'll use the 'tar' and 'gzip'
    programs (as specified by Config.pm) on Unix platforms, otherwise
    we'll use Archive::Tar and Compress::Zlib.

0.02  Wed Sep  5 00:53:04 CDT 2001
  - Added POD documentation.

  - Added the 'install', 'fakeinstall', and 'dist' actions.

  - new() will now determine version string based on 'module_version', or
    'module_version_from', or 'module_name', in that order.

  - Module::Build::Base handles its file paths in a platform-independent
    way, using the File:: modules
