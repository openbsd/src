=head1 NAME

module-version.t - Check or update versions of Perl modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<module-version.t> [B<--update>]

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.6.0 or later, the Perl6::Slurp module, and the JSON::PP Perl module,
both of which are available from CPAN.  JSON::PP is also included in Perl core
in Perl 5.14 and later.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script has a dual purpose as either a test script or a utility script.
The intent is to assist with maintaining consistent versions in a Perl
distribution, supporting both the package keyword syntax introduced in Perl
5.12 or the older explicit setting of a $VERSION variable.

As a test, it reads the current version of a package from the F<MYMETA.json>
file in the current directory (which should be the root of the distribution)
and then looks for any Perl modules in F<lib>.  If it finds any, it checks
that the version number of the Perl module matches the version number of the
package from the F<MYMETA.json> file.  These test results are reported with
Test::More, suitable for any TAP harness.

As a utility script, when run with the B<--update> option, it similarly finds
all Perl modules in F<lib> and then rewrites their version setting to match
the version of the package as determined from the F<MYMETA.json> file.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-u>, B<--update>

Rather than test the Perl modules for the correct version, update all Perl
modules found in the tree under F<lib> to the current version from the
C<MYMETA.json> file.
