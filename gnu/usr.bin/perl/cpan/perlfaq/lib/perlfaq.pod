perlfaq - frequently asked questions about Perl

=head1 VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The perlfaq comprises several documents that answer the most commonly
asked questions about Perl and Perl programming. It's divided by topic
into nine major sections outlined in this document.

=head2 Where to find the perlfaq

The perlfaq is an evolving document.  Read the latest version at
L<http://learn.perl.org/faq/>.  It is also included in the standard Perl
distribution.

=head2 How to use the perlfaq

The C<perldoc> command line tool is part of the standard Perl distribution. To
read the perlfaq:

    $ perldoc perlfaq

To search the perlfaq question headings:

    $ perldoc -q open

=head2 How to contribute to the perlfaq

Review L<https://github.com/perl-doc-cats/perlfaq/wiki>.  If you don't find
your suggestion create an issue or pull request against
L<https://github.com/perl-doc-cats/perlfaq>.

Once approved, changes are merged into L<https://github.com/tpf/perlfaq>, the
repository which drives L<http://learn.perl.org/faq/>, and they are
distributed with the next Perl 5 release.
