# Test that getppid() follows UNIX semantics: when the parent process
# dies, the child is reparented to the init process
# The init process is usually 1, but doesn't have to be, and there's no
# standard way to find out what it is, so the only portable way to go it so
# attempt 2 reparentings and see if the PID both orphaned grandchildren get is
# the same. (and not ours)
#
# NOTE: Docker and Linux containers set parent to 0 on orphaned tests.
# We have to adjust to this below.
