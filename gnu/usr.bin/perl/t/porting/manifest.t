# What does this test?
# This tests the well-formed-ness of the MANIFEST file.
#
# Why do we test this?
# TK
#
# It's broken - how do I fix it?
# If MANIFEST is not sorted properly, you will get this error output:
#      got ''MANIFEST' is NOT sorted properly
#      # '
#      # expected /(?^:is sorted properly)/
#
# To correct this, run either:
#
#   ./perl -Ilib Porting/manisort -o MANIFEST MANIFEST
#
# which will output "'MANIFEST' is NOT sorted properly" but which will
# correct the problem; or:
#
#   make manisort
#
# which will output "WARNING: re-sorting MANIFEST" but which will also
# correct the problem.
