# What does this test?
# This checks that all the perl "utils" don't have embarrassing syntax errors
#
# Why do we test this?
# Right now, without this, it's possible to pass the all the regression tests
# even if one has introduced syntax errors into scripts such as installperl
# or installman. No tests fail, so it's fair game to push the commit.
# Obviously this breaks installing perl, but we won't spot this.
# Whilst we can't easily test that the various scripts *work*, we can at least
# check that we've not made any trivial screw ups.
#
# It's broken - how do I fix it?
# Presumably it's failed because some (other) code that you changed was (also)
# used by one of the utility scripts. So you'll have to manually test that
# script.

# preventing 5.16.0-RC0 from testing successfully.  This test is really only
# needed for porters, anyway.  -- rjbs, 2012-05-10
