=for apidoc uvchr_to_utf8_flags_msgs

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.

Most code should use C<L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>()> rather than call this directly.

This function is for code that wants any warning and/or error messages to be
returned to the caller rather than be displayed.  All messages that would have
been displayed if all lexcial warnings are enabled will be returned.

It is just like C<L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>> but it takes an extra parameter
placed after all the others, C<msgs>.  If this parameter is 0, this function
behaves identically to C<L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>>.  Otherwise, C<msgs> should
be a pointer to an C<HV *> variable, in which this function creates a new HV to
contain any appropriate messages.  The hash has three key-value pairs, as
follows:

=over 4

=item C<text>

The text of the message as a C<SVpv>.

=item C<warn_categories>

The warning category (or categories) packed into a C<SVuv>.

=item C<flag>

A single flag bit associated with this message, in a C<SVuv>.
The bit corresponds to some bit in the C<*errors> return value,
such as C<UNICODE_GOT_SURROGATE>.

=back

It's important to note that specifying this parameter as non-null will cause
any warnings this function would otherwise generate to be suppressed, and
instead be placed in C<*msgs>.  The caller can check the lexical warnings state
(or not) when choosing what to do with the returned messages.

The caller, of course, is responsible for freeing any returned HV.

of the string C<d>; C<d> should have at least C<UVCHR_SKIP(uv)+1> (up to
C<UTF8_MAXBYTES+1>) free bytes available.  The return value is the pointer to
the byte after the end of the new character.  In other words,

    d = uvchr_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, flags);

or, in most cases,

    d = uvchr_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, 0);

This is the Unicode-aware way of saying

    *(d++) = uv;

If C<flags> is 0, this function accepts any code point from 0..C<IV_MAX> as
input.  C<IV_MAX> is typically 0x7FFF_FFFF in a 32-bit word.

Specifying C<flags> can further restrict what is allowed and not warned on, as
follows:

If C<uv> is a Unicode surrogate code point and C<UNICODE_WARN_SURROGATE> is set,
the function will raise a warning, provided UTF8 warnings are enabled.  If
instead C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_SURROGATE> is set, the function will fail and return
NULL.  If both flags are set, the function will both warn and return NULL.

Similarly, the C<UNICODE_WARN_NONCHAR> and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_NONCHAR> flags
affect how the function handles a Unicode non-character.

And likewise, the C<UNICODE_WARN_SUPER> and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_SUPER> flags
affect the handling of code points that are above the Unicode maximum of
0x10FFFF.  Languages other than Perl may not be able to accept files that
contain these.

The flag C<UNICODE_WARN_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE> selects all three of
the above WARN flags; and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE> selects all
three DISALLOW flags.  C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE> restricts the
allowed inputs to the strict UTF-8 traditionally defined by Unicode.
Similarly, C<UNICODE_WARN_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE> and
C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE> are shortcuts to select the
above-Unicode and surrogate flags, but not the non-character ones, as
defined in
L<Unicode Corrigendum #9|http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html>.
See L<perlunicode/Noncharacter code points>.

Extremely high code points were never specified in any standard, and require an
extension to UTF-8 to express, which Perl does.  It is likely that programs
written in something other than Perl would not be able to read files that
contain these; nor would Perl understand files written by something that uses a
different extension.  For these reasons, there is a separate set of flags that
can warn and/or disallow these extremely high code points, even if other
above-Unicode ones are accepted.  They are the C<UNICODE_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED>
and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED> flags.  For more information see
L</C<UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED>>.  Of course C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_SUPER> will
treat all above-Unicode code points, including these, as malformations.  (Note
that the Unicode standard considers anything above 0x10FFFF to be illegal, but
there are standards predating it that allow up to 0x7FFF_FFFF (2**31 -1))

A somewhat misleadingly named synonym for C<UNICODE_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> is
retained for backward compatibility: C<UNICODE_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT>.  Similarly,
C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT> is usable instead of the more accurately named
C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED>.  The names are misleading because on EBCDIC
platforms,these flags can apply to code points that actually do fit in 31 bits.
The new names accurately describe the situation in all cases.

=for apidoc utf8n_to_uvchr

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Most code should use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf>() rather than call this directly.

Bottom level UTF-8 decode routine.
Returns the native code point value of the first character in the string C<s>,
which is assumed to be in UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC) encoding, and no longer than
C<curlen> bytes; C<*retlen> (if C<retlen> isn't NULL) will be set to
the length, in bytes, of that character.

The value of C<flags> determines the behavior when C<s> does not point to a
well-formed UTF-8 character.  If C<flags> is 0, encountering a malformation
causes zero to be returned and C<*retlen> is set so that (S<C<s> + C<*retlen>>)
is the next possible position in C<s> that could begin a non-malformed
character.  Also, if UTF-8 warnings haven't been lexically disabled, a warning
is raised.  Some UTF-8 input sequences may contain multiple malformations.
This function tries to find every possible one in each call, so multiple
warnings can be raised for the same sequence.

Various ALLOW flags can be set in C<flags> to allow (and not warn on)
individual types of malformations, such as the sequence being overlong (that
is, when there is a shorter sequence that can express the same code point;
overlong sequences are expressly forbidden in the UTF-8 standard due to
potential security issues).  Another malformation example is the first byte of
a character not being a legal first byte.  See F<utf8.h> for the list of such
flags.  Even if allowed, this function generally returns the Unicode
REPLACEMENT CHARACTER when it encounters a malformation.  There are flags in
F<utf8.h> to override this behavior for the overlong malformations, but don't
do that except for very specialized purposes.

The C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> flag overrides the behavior when a non-allowed (by other
flags) malformation is found.  If this flag is set, the routine assumes that
the caller will raise a warning, and this function will silently just set
C<retlen> to C<-1> (cast to C<STRLEN>) and return zero.

Note that this API requires disambiguation between successful decoding a C<NUL>
character, and an error return (unless the C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> flag is set), as
in both cases, 0 is returned, and, depending on the malformation, C<retlen> may
be set to 1.  To disambiguate, upon a zero return, see if the first byte of
C<s> is 0 as well.  If so, the input was a C<NUL>; if not, the input had an
error.  Or you can use C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr_error>>.

Certain code points are considered problematic.  These are Unicode surrogates,
Unicode non-characters, and code points above the Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF.
By default these are considered regular code points, but certain situations
warrant special handling for them, which can be specified using the C<flags>
parameter.  If C<flags> contains C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE>, all
three classes are treated as malformations and handled as such.  The flags
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SURROGATE>, C<UTF8_DISALLOW_NONCHAR>, and
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER> (meaning above the legal Unicode maximum) can be set to
disallow these categories individually.  C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE>
restricts the allowed inputs to the strict UTF-8 traditionally defined by
Unicode.  Use C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE> to use the strictness
definition given by
L<Unicode Corrigendum #9|http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html>.
The difference between traditional strictness and C9 strictness is that the
latter does not forbid non-character code points.  (They are still discouraged,
however.)  For more discussion see L<perlunicode/Noncharacter code points>.

The flags C<UTF8_WARN_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE>,
C<UTF8_WARN_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE>, C<UTF8_WARN_SURROGATE>,
C<UTF8_WARN_NONCHAR>, and C<UTF8_WARN_SUPER> will cause warning messages to be
raised for their respective categories, but otherwise the code points are
considered valid (not malformations).  To get a category to both be treated as
a malformation and raise a warning, specify both the WARN and DISALLOW flags.
(But note that warnings are not raised if lexically disabled nor if
C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> is also specified.)

Extremely high code points were never specified in any standard, and require an
extension to UTF-8 to express, which Perl does.  It is likely that programs
written in something other than Perl would not be able to read files that
contain these; nor would Perl understand files written by something that uses a
different extension.  For these reasons, there is a separate set of flags that
can warn and/or disallow these extremely high code points, even if other
above-Unicode ones are accepted.  They are the C<UTF8_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> and
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED> flags.  For more information see
L</C<UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED>>.  Of course C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER> will treat all
above-Unicode code points, including these, as malformations.
(Note that the Unicode standard considers anything above 0x10FFFF to be
illegal, but there are standards predating it that allow up to 0x7FFF_FFFF
(2**31 -1))

A somewhat misleadingly named synonym for C<UTF8_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> is
retained for backward compatibility: C<UTF8_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT>.  Similarly,
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT> is usable instead of the more accurately named
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED>.  The names are misleading because these flags
can apply to code points that actually do fit in 31 bits.  This happens on
EBCDIC platforms, and sometimes when the L<overlong
malformation|/C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>> is also present.  The new names accurately
describe the situation in all cases.


All other code points corresponding to Unicode characters, including private
use and those yet to be assigned, are never considered malformed and never
warn.

=for apidoc utf8n_to_uvchr_error

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Most code should use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf>() rather than call this directly.

This function is for code that needs to know what the precise malformation(s)
are when an error is found.  If you also need to know the generated warning
messages, use L</utf8n_to_uvchr_msgs>() instead.

It is like C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr>> but it takes an extra parameter placed after
all the others, C<errors>.  If this parameter is 0, this function behaves
identically to C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr>>.  Otherwise, C<errors> should be a pointer
to a C<U32> variable, which this function sets to indicate any errors found.
Upon return, if C<*errors> is 0, there were no errors found.  Otherwise,
C<*errors> is the bit-wise C<OR> of the bits described in the list below.  Some
of these bits will be set if a malformation is found, even if the input
C<flags> parameter indicates that the given malformation is allowed; those
exceptions are noted:

=over 4

=item C<UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED>

The input sequence is not standard UTF-8, but a Perl extension.  This bit is
set only if the input C<flags> parameter contains either the
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED> or the C<UTF8_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> flags.

Code points above 0x7FFF_FFFF (2**31 - 1) were never specified in any standard,
and so some extension must be used to express them.  Perl uses a natural
extension to UTF-8 to represent the ones up to 2**36-1, and invented a further
extension to represent even higher ones, so that any code point that fits in a
64-bit word can be represented.  Text using these extensions is not likely to
be portable to non-Perl code.  We lump both of these extensions together and
refer to them as Perl extended UTF-8.  There exist other extensions that people
have invented, incompatible with Perl's.

On EBCDIC platforms starting in Perl v5.24, the Perl extension for representing
extremely high code points kicks in at 0x3FFF_FFFF (2**30 -1), which is lower
than on ASCII.  Prior to that, code points 2**31 and higher were simply
unrepresentable, and a different, incompatible method was used to represent
code points between 2**30 and 2**31 - 1.

On both platforms, ASCII and EBCDIC, C<UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED> is set if
Perl extended UTF-8 is used.

In earlier Perls, this bit was named C<UTF8_GOT_ABOVE_31_BIT>, which you still
may use for backward compatibility.  That name is misleading, as this flag may
be set when the code point actually does fit in 31 bits.  This happens on
EBCDIC platforms, and sometimes when the L<overlong
malformation|/C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>> is also present.  The new name accurately
describes the situation in all cases.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_CONTINUATION>

The input sequence was malformed in that the first byte was a a UTF-8
continuation byte.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_EMPTY>

The input C<curlen> parameter was 0.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>

The input sequence was malformed in that there is some other sequence that
evaluates to the same code point, but that sequence is shorter than this one.

Until Unicode 3.1, it was legal for programs to accept this malformation, but
it was discovered that this created security issues.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_NONCHAR>

The code point represented by the input UTF-8 sequence is for a Unicode
non-character code point.
This bit is set only if the input C<flags> parameter contains either the
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_NONCHAR> or the C<UTF8_WARN_NONCHAR> flags.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_NON_CONTINUATION>

The input sequence was malformed in that a non-continuation type byte was found
in a position where only a continuation type one should be.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_OVERFLOW>

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a code point that is not
representable in the number of bits available in an IV on the current platform.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_SHORT>

The input sequence was malformed in that C<curlen> is smaller than required for
a complete sequence.  In other words, the input is for a partial character
sequence.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_SUPER>

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a non-Unicode code point;
that is, one above the legal Unicode maximum.
This bit is set only if the input C<flags> parameter contains either the
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER> or the C<UTF8_WARN_SUPER> flags.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_SURROGATE>

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a -Unicode UTF-16 surrogate
code point.
This bit is set only if the input C<flags> parameter contains either the
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SURROGATE> or the C<UTF8_WARN_SURROGATE> flags.

=back

To do your own error handling, call this function with the C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY>
flag to suppress any warnings, and then examine the C<*errors> return.

=for apidoc utf8n_to_uvchr_msgs

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Most code should use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf>() rather than call this directly.

This function is for code that needs to know what the precise malformation(s)
are when an error is found, and wants the corresponding warning and/or error
messages to be returned to the caller rather than be displayed.  All messages
that would have been displayed if all lexcial warnings are enabled will be
returned.

It is just like C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr_error>> but it takes an extra parameter
placed after all the others, C<msgs>.  If this parameter is 0, this function
behaves identically to C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr_error>>.  Otherwise, C<msgs> should
be a pointer to an C<AV *> variable, in which this function creates a new AV to
contain any appropriate messages.  The elements of the array are ordered so
that the first message that would have been displayed is in the 0th element,
and so on.  Each element is a hash with three key-value pairs, as follows:

=over 4

=item C<text>

The text of the message as a C<SVpv>.

=item C<warn_categories>

The warning category (or categories) packed into a C<SVuv>.

=item C<flag>

A single flag bit associated with this message, in a C<SVuv>.
The bit corresponds to some bit in the C<*errors> return value,
such as C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>.

=back

It's important to note that specifying this parameter as non-null will cause
any warnings this function would otherwise generate to be suppressed, and
instead be placed in C<*msgs>.  The caller can check the lexical warnings state
(or not) when choosing what to do with the returned messages.

If the flag C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> is passed, no warnings are generated, and hence
no AV is created.

The caller, of course, is responsible for freeing any returned AV.

Converts a potentially UTF-8 encoded string C<s> of length C<*lenp> into native

actually encoded in UTF-8.

Unlike L</utf8_to_bytes> but like L</bytes_to_utf8>, this is non-destructive of
the input string.

Do nothing if C<*is_utf8p> is 0, or if there are code points in the string
not expressible in native byte encoding.  In these cases, C<*is_utf8p> and
C<*lenp> are unchanged, and the return value is the original C<s>.

Otherwise, C<*is_utf8p> is set to 0, and the return value is a pointer to a
newly created string containing a downgraded copy of C<s>, and whose length is
returned in C<*lenp>, updated.  The new string is C<NUL>-terminated.  The
caller is responsible for arranging for the memory used by this string to get
freed.

Upon successful return, the number of variants in the string can be computed by
having saved the value of C<*lenp> before the call, and subtracting the
after-call value of C<*lenp> from it.

for apidoc bytes_from_utf8_loc

Like C<L</bytes_from_utf8>()>, but takes an extra parameter, a pointer to where
to store the location of the first character in C<"s"> that cannot be
converted to non-UTF8.

If that parameter is C<NULL>, this function behaves identically to
C<bytes_from_utf8>.

Otherwise if C<*is_utf8p> is 0 on input, the function behaves identically to
C<bytes_from_utf8>, except it also sets C<*first_non_downgradable> to C<NULL>.

Otherwise, the function returns a newly created C<NUL>-terminated string
containing the non-UTF8 equivalent of the convertible first portion of
C<"s">.  C<*lenp> is set to its length, not including the terminating C<NUL>.
If the entire input string was converted, C<*is_utf8p> is set to a FALSE value,
and C<*first_non_downgradable> is set to C<NULL>.

Otherwise, C<*first_non_downgradable> set to point to the first byte of the
first character in the original string that wasn't converted.  C<*is_utf8p> is
unchanged.  Note that the new string may have length 0.

Another way to look at it is, if C<*first_non_downgradable> is non-C<NULL> and
C<*is_utf8p> is TRUE, this function starts at the beginning of C<"s"> and
converts as many characters in it as possible stopping at the first one it
finds that can't be converted to non-UTF-8.  C<*first_non_downgradable> is
set to point to that.  The function returns the portion that could be converted
in a newly created C<NUL>-terminated string, and C<*lenp> is set to its length,
not including the terminating C<NUL>.  If the very first character in the
original could not be converted, C<*lenp> will be 0, and the new string will
contain just a single C<NUL>.  If the entire input string was converted,
C<*is_utf8p> is set to FALSE and C<*first_non_downgradable> is set to C<NULL>.

Upon successful return, the number of variants in the converted portion of the
string can be computed by having saved the value of C<*lenp> before the call,
and subtracting the after-call value of C<*lenp> from it.

/* The process for changing the case is essentially the same for the four case
 * change types, except there are complications for folding.  Otherwise the
 * difference is only which case to change to.  To make sure that they all do
 * the same thing, the bodies of the functions are extracted out into the
 * following two macros.  The functions are written with the same variable
 * names, and these are known and used inside these macros.  It would be
 * better, of course, to have inline functions to do it, but since different
 * macros are called, depending on which case is being changed to, this is not
 * feasible in C (to khw's knowledge).  Two macros are created so that the fold
 * function can start with the common start macro, then finish with its special
 * handling; while the other three cases can just use the common end macro.
 *
 * The algorithm is to use the proper (passed in) macro or function to change
 * the case for code points that are below 256.  The macro is used if using
 * locale rules for the case change; the function if not.  If the code point is
 * above 255, it is computed from the input UTF-8, and another macro is called
 * to do the conversion.  If necessary, the output is converted to UTF-8.  If
 * using a locale, we have to check that the change did not cross the 255/256
 * boundary, see check_locale_boundary_crossing() for further details.
 *
 * The macros are split with the correct case change for the below-256 case
 * stored into 'result', and in the middle of an else clause for the above-255
 * case.  At that point in the 'else', 'result' is not the final result, but is
 * the input code point calculated from the UTF-8.  The fold code needs to
 * realize all this and take it from there.
 *
 * If you read the two macros as sequential, it's easier to understand what's
 * going on. */

 *
 * A "swash" is a hash which contains initially the keys/values set up by
 * SWASHNEW.  The purpose is to be able to completely represent a Unicode
 * property for all possible code points.  Things are stored in a compact form
 * (see utf8_heavy.pl) so that calculation is required to find the actual
 * property value for a given code point.  As code points are looked up, new
 * key/value pairs are added to the hash, so that the calculation doesn't have
 * to ever be re-done.  Further, each calculation is done, not just for the
 * desired one, but for a whole block of code points adjacent to that one.
 * For binary properties on ASCII machines, the block is usually for 64 code
 * points, starting with a code point evenly divisible by 64.  Thus if the
 * property value for code point 257 is requested, the code goes out and
 * calculates the property values for all 64 code points between 256 and 319,
 * and stores these as a single 64-bit long bit vector, called a "swatch",
 * under the key for code point 256.  The key is the UTF-8 encoding for code
 * point 256, minus the final byte.  Thus, if the length of the UTF-8 encoding
 * for a code point is 13 bytes, the key will be 12 bytes long.  If the value
 * for code point 258 is then requested, this code realizes that it would be
 * stored under the key for 256, and would find that value and extract the
 * relevant bit, offset from 256.
 *
 * Non-binary properties are stored in as many bits as necessary to represent
 * their values (32 currently, though the code is more general than that), not
 * as single bits, but the principle is the same: the value for each key is a
 * vector that encompasses the property values for all code points whose UTF-8
 * representations are represented by the key.  That is, for all code points
 * whose UTF-8 representations are length N bytes, and the key is the first N-1
 * bytes of that.

=for apidoc foldEQ_utf8

Returns true if the leading portions of the strings C<s1> and C<s2> (either or
both of which may be in UTF-8) are the same case-insensitively; false
otherwise.  How far into the strings to compare is determined by other input
parameters.

If C<u1> is true, the string C<s1> is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode;
otherwise it is assumed to be in native 8-bit encoding.  Correspondingly for
C<u2> with respect to C<s2>.

If the byte length C<l1> is non-zero, it says how far into C<s1> to check for
fold equality.  In other words, C<s1>+C<l1> will be used as a goal to reach.
The scan will not be considered to be a match unless the goal is reached, and
scanning won't continue past that goal.  Correspondingly for C<l2> with respect
to C<s2>.

If C<pe1> is non-C<NULL> and the pointer it points to is not C<NULL>, that
pointer is considered an end pointer to the position 1 byte past the maximum
point in C<s1> beyond which scanning will not continue under any circumstances.
(This routine assumes that UTF-8 encoded input strings are not malformed;
malformed input can cause it to read past C<pe1>).  This means that if both
C<l1> and C<pe1> are specified, and C<pe1> is less than C<s1>+C<l1>, the match
will never be successful because it can never
get as far as its goal (and in fact is asserted against).  Correspondingly for
C<pe2> with respect to C<s2>.

At least one of C<s1> and C<s2> must have a goal (at least one of C<l1> and
C<l2> must be non-zero), and if both do, both have to be
reached for a successful match.   Also, if the fold of a character is multiple
characters, all of them must be matched (see tr21 reference below for
'folding').

Upon a successful match, if C<pe1> is non-C<NULL>,
it will be set to point to the beginning of the I<next> character of C<s1>
beyond what was matched.  Correspondingly for C<pe2> and C<s2>.

For case-insensitiveness, the "casefolding" of Unicode is used
instead of upper/lowercasing both the characters, see
L<http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/> (Case Mappings).

=for apidoc utf8_to_uvchr

Returns the native code point of the first character in the string C<s>
which is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding; C<retlen> will be set to the
length, in bytes, of that character.

Some, but not all, UTF-8 malformations are detected, and in fact, some
malformed input could cause reading beyond the end of the input buffer, which
is why this function is deprecated.  Use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf> instead.

If C<s> points to one of the detected malformations, and UTF8 warnings are
enabled, zero is returned and C<*retlen> is set (if C<retlen> isn't
C<NULL>) to -1.  If those warnings are off, the computed value if well-defined (or
the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, if not) is silently returned, and C<*retlen>
is set (if C<retlen> isn't NULL) so that (S<C<s> + C<*retlen>>) is the
next possible position in C<s> that could begin a non-malformed character.
See L</utf8n_to_uvchr> for details on when the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER is returned.
