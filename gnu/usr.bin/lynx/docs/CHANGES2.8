=======================================================================
---            Release of Lynx v2.8 (March 10, 1998)                ---
=======================================================================

1998-03-10
* omit platform-specifics about release (recommended by HN). - TD
* drop samples/lynx.cfg since it is redundant (recommended by HN).  - TD
* modify makefile.in so that "make install-cfg" does not edit lynx.cfg
  to point at local helpfiles, while "make install-help" will now do
  that (reported by LP). - TD
* one more patch to UPPER8 function. - LP
1998-03-07
* move ifdef's for EXP_8BIT_TOUPPER inside UPPER8 function to allow
  check for DOS/WINDOWS display charsets. - LP
1998-03-06
* clarify relationship between the configure script and userdefs.h with
  respect to the LYNX_CFG_FILE definition. - TD
* newer CF_FIND_LIBRARY autoconf macro, to allow ncurses library in /lib
  only, needed for SUSE Linux. - TD
* add casts to UPPER8 function's comparison for equality of parameters, and
  to TOUPPER macro to guard against sign-extension due to prototype. - AC
* correct spelling of -lcur_colr library in aclocal.m4, change order of
  tests to put -lHcurses second on HP-UX (patch by Jonathan Sergent).
* restore simple zmodem downloader script, displaced by recent undocumented
  change (there are some concerns about security or permissions with the
  alternate script).  - DK
* DOSPATH localfile patch:  corrected display of file://localhost/c:/,
  which was displayed as file://localhost/c%3A/ (tweak LYConvertToUrl() in
  LYUtils.c).  Now we may start "lynx c:" or 'go' c:  and not see these
  strange letters.  On the other hand, if % and # symbols found in local
  path it will be escaped as before (note that #fragment is not supposed here
  to be used from command line...) - LP
* workaround error in vendor's terminfo description of 'dtterm' by ensuring
  we limit color pair-number accordingly. - TD
1998-03-04
* strip -g compiler option if not otherwise specified, for debugging (note
  that autoconf 2.12 does not try to use -O option due to concerns about
  compiler optimization). - TD
* correct value of $host_os used in CF_CURSES_LIBS for special-case of
  HP's -lHcurses (Jonathan Sergent <sergent@ecn.purdue.edu>).
* correct def7_uni.tbl for Greek letters, note about UPPER8 assumption
  added to chrtrans/README.format. - LP
* few comments corrected. - LP
1998-02-28
* create new PRCS revision (2.8pre) for pre-release testing of Lynx 2.8
* remove RELEASE_STATEMENT, merging it into README as per HN's
  recommendation - TD
* comments/minor changes to HTDOS.c, HTDOS.h, LYUtils.c - LP
* document recent fix for RAW_DOS_KEY_HACK in lynx.cfg - DK
* rename CHANGES.new to docs/CHANGES2.8 - TD
* undo last minor change to UPPER8 - LP
1998-02-27
* add RELEASE_STATEMENT file. - TD
* modify slang configuration to add fake 'scrollok()' - JED
* modify LYmktime() so that 2-digit years must be greater/equal to 70 to be in
  1900's (patch by Bela Lubkin).  Also adjust parse_windows_nt_dir_entry() and
  parse_cms_dir_entry() as noted by Bela - TD
* comment-out entries in cp1252_uni.tbl which correspond to nonprinting
  control-characters - LP
* add logic in SGML.c to correspond with 2.7.2 logic for codes used by
  Microsoft FrontPage. - LP
* remove unneeded code for nbsp, ensp, emsp, thinsp and shy from handle_entity()
  in SGML.c - LP
* ifdef UPPER8 function with EXP_8BIT_TOUPPER,
  add configure option --enable-8bit-toupper to allow testing.  - TD
* case-insensitive search and 8bit letters:  It was realized that
  information about upper/lower mapping got from TOUPPER which depends on
  locale in its 8bit and usually fails on non-UNIX systems.  We introduce
  UPPER8 and strcasecomp8 to implement 8-bit aware case-independent search
  using one simple assumption:  8bit upper/lower case letters have their
  "7bit approximation" images in def7_uni.tbl matched case-insensitively
  (7bit).  The cost of this assumption is that several differently accented
  letters may be interpreted as equal but this is negligible if the search
  string is more than one character long.  (LYStrings.c, also HTString.c
  and LYMainLoop.c).  - LP & TD
* add SunOS 4.x-specific ifdef to quiet redefinition warnings for sys/ioctl.h
  vs sys/termios.h - TD
* convert usage/options messages into arrays to simplify maintenance. - TD
* add "-useragent" command-line option to set "User-Agent" (request by Merlin
  Mathesius <merlin_mathesius@swissbank.com>).  - LP
* tweak HTML in LYDownload.c, LYPrint.c to restore some double-spacing effects
  altered in 'collapsible spaces' change 1998-01-25 (reported by James Elkinton
  <zio@blueneptune.com>).  - LP
* use strncasecomp/strcasecomp consistently throughout to avoid library
  dependency on strncasecmp/strcasecmp. - TD
* correct lengths in several strncasecmp calls for command-line options
  (though -w is still an abbreviation for -width). - TD
* test-build with BSD curses on OS/2 EMX (does not display properly), and
  with ncurses.
* add configure check CF_FUNC_LSTAT.
* modify CF_CHECK_ERRNO so that configure script on OS/2 EMX finds sys_errlist.
* reset styles[] and styleSheet list in DefaultStyle.c, HTML.c so that when
  a user reloads a page with ^R, we undo changes to those data structures
  (reported by Larry Virden). - TD
* remove extra copy of HTML.h from Implementation directory. - TD
* add CF_GCC_ATTRIBUTES to configure script, to use in flushing out unused
  parameter warnings (and later, to support prototypes for logging). - TD
* rename 'extra_entities' to 'unicode_entities' (recommended by LP) - TD
* add configure option --use-default-colors, to allow background color to use
  default value (request by SUNAGAWA Keiki <Keiki_Sunagawa@yokogawa.co.jp>) -
  TD
* change default for --disable-internal-links so it is normally-off - TD
1998-02-19
* add configure test CF_FIONBIO, some ifdef's (e.g., S_IFLNK) to support
  build on OS/2 EMX. - TD
* add configure option --disable-extended-dtd, for testing - TD
* split-out entities.h from HTMLDTD.c - TD
* remove obsolete mapping in "private" e000 area of mnem_suni.tbl,
  mnem2_suni.tbl, rfc_suni.tbl - LP
* remove unused function HTMLGetLatinOneValue() - LP
* remove logic that would attempt lookup of Unicode entities by index into the
  unicode_entities.put_entity method (e.g., of HTML_dtd), in HTML.c
  (HTML_put_entity) and HTMLGen.c (HTMLGen_put_entity) - LP
* tweaks to HTPlain.c, LYCharUtils.c and SGML.c, remove extra checks for
  Unicode mdash, ndash, trade, as well as "iso-8859-2", "koi8-r", since they
  are done in the chartrans tables - LP
* add an alias 'H' for F1 when using RAWDOSKEYHACK (LYStrings.c) - DK
* restore -DRAWDOSKEYHACK to src/makefile.dos, reported by DK - TD
* correct a typo in CF_CURSES_LIBS configure macro, which caused the configure
  script to not add termcap library to the list - TD
* correct --disable-internal-links, by adding DONT_TRACK_INTERNAL_LINKS to
  config.hin - TD
1998-02-13
* use size_t in SGML_dtd. - TD
* remove extra trademark symbol and quotes from chrtrans/*.tbl, since
  they are in the default def7_uni.tbl - LP
* New item to lynx.cfg added:  PREPEND_CHARSET_TO_SOURCE (similar to BASE), we
  need it to resolve charset for downloaded/printed HTML sources which became
  local.  This is really useful because downloaded and printed texts may
  happened to have different charsets so assume_local_charset fails.  For
  downloaded source meta charset added from HTTP charset header (if and only if
  present).  For printed source meta charset added from display_charset (real
  charset after chrtrans).  If the original source has its own meta charset
  and we add the second on top - Lynx currently use those on top and ignore
  others (old) value (that is correct, although non standard like BASE on top). 
  The compilation default is FALSE (compatibility).  - LP
* modify ncurses mouse behavior to match slang (use button 3 rather than
  button 2 for "previous document" (reported by Michael Ritzert) - TD
* use case-independent comparison for tail-only comparison in override_proxy
  (patch by pg@sweng.stortek.com) - TD
* remove unneeded definitions of ALT_CHAR_SET, NCURSES_VERSION in
  src/makefile.dos - DK
* correct syntax for the RAW_DOS_KEY_HACK in lynx.cfg, add a little information
  on how to compile this.  Also patched makefile.dos to make compilation of the
  raw dos key hack the default when compiling in DOS. - DK
* change back to boolean since the logic was unused: UCCanTranslateFromTo(),
  UCCanTranslateUniTo(), and UCCanUniTranslateFrom(). - TD
* Mods of SGML.c and LYCharUtils.c to improve handling of entities,
  obsolete stuff removed (not all yet). - LP
* -localhost mode: disable interpreting BASE HREF= if local_host_only
  to resolve local html files with BASE (Lynx add base to downloaded
  sources and this may affect links if looking them with -localhost).
  (tweak in html.c). - LP
* Modify HTMLGetEntityUCValue in LYCharSets.c:
  we begin to move from old style entities[] to unicode-based. - LP
* added a few comments. - LP
1998-02-07
* Fixed a bug in HTTP.c which could cause trashing of authorization info
  for an origin HTTP(s) server if the request is being proxied. - FM
* Tweak in HTTP.c so that the reloading variable is not reset until
  after any resubmissions due to authorization challenges. - FM
* Tweaks of userdefs.h, lynx.cfg, LYMessages_en.h, LYMain.c, LYMainLoop.c,
  LYClean.c, LYReadCFG.c, and LYGlobalDefs.h so that the QUIT_DEFAULT_YES
  compilation symbol can be overridden in lynx.cfg, in keeping with
  the principle that only strict security-related compilation symbols
  cannot be overridden at run time. - FM
1998-02-05
* adjust formatting, comments & some messages in WWW files to simplify
  comparison with 2.7.2 version.  (I have preserved some chunks of difference,
  ifdef'd NOTUSED_FOTEMODS or NOTDEFINED for ease of comparison -- these may be
  removed at a later time, when we are done absorbing changes from 2.7.2) - TD
* Update SGML entity to Unicode table in HTMLDTD.c from ftp.unicode.org -
  lots of new entities, iso-latin-1 now included there.
  See also new files in test/ directory:  sgml.html and unicode.html.
  Tweak a few typos in test/*.html according to sgml.html.
  Add a few new entries in def7_uni.tbl according to sgml.html - LP
* Cleanup iso01-iso09, cp866 tables against ones found at ftp.unicode.org
* Strip the fat from LYCharSets.c - unnecessary obsoleted tables removed
  and redirected to SevenBitApproximation table (ones which have unicode tables
  override it anyway, those for CJK had exactly the same tables as
  SevenBit..). - LP
* Remove obsolete "Other ISO Latin" charset, which works _exactly_ the same
  as "7 bit approximation" (See the note on 06-14-96 where it comes from).
* Sort the list of charsets in Options according to 2.7.2 for 1997-10-15,
  see the comments in UCinit at the bottom of UCDomap.c - LP
* add ifdef to HTFile.c to workaround conflicting S_IFIFO vs S_IFSOCK
  (e.g., on Apollo, from a report by Dave Eaton <dwe@arde.com>) - TD
* updated INSTALLATION (patch by HN) - TD
* modify DOS handling of CTL-C and CTL-BREAK handling for DOS to allow
  exiting via SIGINT when pressing CTL-C or CTL-BREAK regardless of the
  BREAK setting in DOS.  This leaves the BREAK setting unchanged unless
  CTL-C or CTL-BREAK is actually pressed (in which case it leaves BREAK
  ON) - DK
* add note about Lynx vs frames to User's Guide (from Al Gilman) - TD
1998-01-27
* correct lynx.man to reference section "1" (one), not "l", since it is
  not installed in the latter (reported by Jason Castonguay
  <jcast@ntplx.net>) - TD
* fix for VMS declarations of mainloop() and from_hex() (reported by FM) - TD
* add to include-paths in libmake.com, build.com (reported by FM, citing
  Brian Tillman) - TD
* revert HTML.c to use LYHandleSELECT() - TD
* align cases for function keys in LYStrings.c with 2.7.2 - TD
* remove EXP_CHARTRANS ifdef's - TD
* remove symbol USE_SIZECHANGEHACK
* adjust formatting, comments & some messages in most remaining ./src files to
  simplify comparison with 2.7.2 version.  - TD
1998-01-25
* Changed the utf-8 Display Character Set string to "UNICODE UTF-8"
  (i.e., added the hyphen between UTF and 8), and fixed typos in
  the comments about iso-8859-5. LP & FM
* Modified HTML.c to add collapsible spaces before and after IMG ALT
  strings or pseudo-ALTs whether or not the IMG element is within
  Anchor content.  The occasional absence of such spaces due to poor
  HTML was problematic for blind users.  Note that markup which uses
  an image for a fancy letter with the ASCII letter as an ALT will
  have that letter separated from the rest of the word.  Also note
  that these spaces will not be collapsed in PRE blocks, but IMG is
  invalid in PRE blocks.  The spaces could be omitted when IMG is
  used invalidly in PRE blocks, but that would revive the problem
  for blind users that they might not be present at all, so it seems
  better to suffer extra spaces in such cases. - FM 
1998-01-24
* Tweak in HTAccess.c to reset the title element in anchors on forced
  reloads. - FM
1998-01-22
* Tweaks in HTML.c to prevent collapsing of blank lines within TEXTAREA
  default values.  Note that we still strip any leading or trailing
  blank lines (reported by Edward S. Marshall <emarshal@xnet.com>). - FM
* Tweaks of LYCurses.c, LYMain.c, LYOptions.c, LYReadCFG.c, LYUtils.c
  and LYAuto.c to ensure properly setting, with internal buffering, and
  avoid memory leaks for the display and homedir values (reported by
  pg@sweng.stortek.com). - FM
* include userdefs.h in LYCurses.h to address redefinition warnings for
  curses-related configuration. - TD
* adjust formatting, comments & some messages in recently-modified files to
  simplify comparison with 2.7.2 version.  - TD
* remove obsolete logic from UCCanTranslateFromTo, (recommended by LP). - TD
* make character set names (e.g., cp437, cp850, next) consistent in lynx.cfg,
  userdefs.h (reported by LP).  - TD
* change configure script to check for termcap library before curses, in case
  it is dependent.  - TD
* More corrections in the Russian Cyrillic area of def7_uni.tbl. - LP
1998-01-17
* correct logic for no_color_video by ensuring that if not defined, it
  doesn't disable underline with color. - TD
* remove NSL_CLONE - didn't build. - TD
1998-01-16
* eliminate gcc "shadowed variable", "nested declaration", "no previous
  prototype" warnings. - TD
* add --disable-internal-links configure option. - TD
* remove W3C gateway (patch by DK, based on email from Gerald Oskoboiny
  <gerald@w3.org>). - TD
* documentation updates (patch by JS). - TD
* add CONTENT_TYPE to environment of lynxcgi POST documents (reported by
  Ty Sarna <tsarna@endicor.com> & FM). - TD
* add NSL_CLONE ifdef that enables use of the Linux clone() call instead of
  fork() for the gethostbyname() calls in HTTCP.c.  (patch by Ryan Nielsen
  <ran@haxor.com>). - TD
from the lynx code.  I think the following patch does this.
1998-01-15
* Tweak of the NSL_FORK code in HTTCP.c to prevent zombie processes from
  being created when gethostbyname() is interrupted. - RN
* Corrected the Russian Cyrillic area of the def7_uni.tbl Unicode to
  7-bit approximations conversion table. - LP
* Mods of UCAux.c, LYCharUtils.c, SGML.c and HTPlain.c to use 7-bit
  approximations instead of 8th bit stripping when the document charset
  is koi8-r and the Display Character Set does not have the corresponding
  characters. - FM
* Tweaks in HTML.c to ignore a newline character immediately following
  a PRE start tag more consistently.  When PRE blocks are used to create
  blank lines, you should get only as many as are actually included in
  the PRE block, unless you include less than the number specified for
  "before" the block to which you return, in which case you'll get the
  latter number of blank lines. - FM
1998-01-13
* Fixed a typo in the HTParse() code of HTParse.c for checking whether
  a colon in the host field indeed delimits a port number. - FM
* Changed the internal MIME names for all Microsoft Windows codepages
  from cp#### to windows-####, since the latter is used more commonly
  as the charset value in META elements and/or Content-Type headers,
  and most of them have been registered that way with IANA.  Note,
  however, that Microsoft uses cp instead of windows- prefixes in the
  charset names for the Unicode conversion tables submitted to the
  Unicode Consortium.  Also note that we still treat cp, cp-, and ibm
  prefixes as synonyms for the windows- prefix. - FM
1998-01-06
* work around for 'keypad()' function w/o corresponding key defines
  (reported by Francisco A. Tomei Torres for NeXTstep 4.0). - TD
* quote message in install rule, just in case (from HN). - TD
* correct expression to supply default value of .cfg file's pathname
  (reported by LE & Ambrose Li <acli@acli.interlog.com>). - TD
* correct dependency of .cfg files upon $(libdir) in makefile.in - TD
1998-01-04
* correct temporary filename for -traversal -crawl (patch by Doug Kaufman). - TD
* correct redefinition of SYSTEM_MAIL_FLAGS. (reported by Doug Kaufman). - TD
* uncache current document when character set may have changed (patch
  by Andrey A. Chernov) - TD
* modify Linux setfont code to restore the original font on exit - TD
* correct missing backslash (again) in makefile.in
  (reported by Mark Mentovai - again) - TD
1998-01-02
* workaround for sed expression when rerunning configure with config.cache
  for slang libraries (reported by Hynek Med). - TD
* fix indicated by Laura Eaves (LE) for LYUCFullyTranslateString_1() - TD
* modify SPAWNING_MSG for DOSPATH configuration, avoid unnecessary use
  of clear-screen in shell (patch by Doug Kaufman). - TD
* remove install-help from list for install rule, adding message to
  indicate how to install it. - TD
* install lynx.lss only if color-style is configured. - TD
* correct filemode for DJGPP when processing config-file, patch by
  Doug Kaufman). - TD
* add LYNX_LSS_FILE to config.hin, reported by Ambrose Li
  <acli@acli.interlog.com>. - TD
* new copy of INSTALLATION file from HN. - TD
* add COPY* to install rule. - TD
* simplify includes in UCdomap.c by using include-path in makefiles. - TD
* build configure script with patched autoconf to workaround limited
  environment space on CLIX 3.1 - TD
* rename mnemonic_suni.tbl to mnem2_suni.tbl to accommodate 'make' on
  older system with 14-character name-limit. - TD
* sorted some lists (e.g., character sets) which were unreadable. - TD
* incorporate most of FM's changes from 971124 to 971230 (see below). - TD
  (Note:  don't try to use fflush(stdin) -- it's an FAQ -- nonstandard,
  dumps core on some platforms).
1997-12-30
* Added Unicode translation support for "DosBaltRim (cp775)" and
  "WinBaltRim (cp1257)". - FM
1997-12-29
* Fixed bug in the order of re-initializations for the 1997-12-22
  get_connection() mods. - FM
* Fixed typos in some LYCharUtils.c comment. - FM
* Fixed typo in LYrcFile.c comments concerning the NO_FROM_HEADER
  symbol. - DK
1997-12-24
* resolve conflict between autoconf $INSTALL and lynx's INSTALL_PATH
  (reported by Scott McGee). - TD
* modify CF_CHECK_FUNCDECL to work with non-gcc compilers. - TD
* add <stdio.h> to prototype test for getgrgid getgrnam, needed on SVr3. - TD
* add install-lss to makefile.in. - TD
* modify order of includes in LYKeymap.c so that USE_EXTERNALS is defined
  if it comes from userdefs.h (inferred from a report by Larry Virden). - TD
* correct spelling of USE_EXTERNALS which prevented --enable-externs from
  working. - TD
* move assignment to stderr from VMSexit to cleanup function (reported
  by Brian Tillman & FM). - TD
* modify UCChangeTerminalCodepage() to not use stderr, disentangling it
  from stderr/logfile hack. - TD
* rename docs/CHANGES2-* files to docs/CHANGES2.* (reported by
  Doug Kaufman). - TD
* add start_color() call to DOSPATH version of start_curses() to
  fix problem reported by Doug Kaufman - TD
* correct typo in ColorCode() function (reported by Doug Kaufman) - TD
* modify comments in makefile.in (patch by HN) - TD
* minor fixes for CF_CHECK_ERRNO, CF_SIZECHANGE, CF_SLANG_CPPFLAGS
  macros. - TD
* add configure option --enable-nsl-fork to turn on code defined by
  NSL_FORK. - TD
* add configure option --enable-links to turn on code defined by
  UNDERLINE_LINKS. - TD
* add configure option --enable-font-switch, to turn on code defined by
  EXP_CHARTRANS_AUTOSWITCH. - TD
* modify configure CF_CURSES_LIBS test to look also for ncurses,
  since some systems do not have a "curses" library (reported by
  Michael Ritzert). - TD
1997-12-22
* Reworked -width=NUMBER command line switch for specifying the screen
  width for formatting of dumps (default is 80; forced wraps occur at one
  column less than the screen width, i.e., at 79 by default). - FM
* Tweak of get_connection() in HTFTP.c to re-initialize the elements of
  the connection structure when using a previously allocated connection
  object. - DW & FM
* Mods of LYexit.c, LYClean.c, LYMain.c and LYMainLoop.c to fflush() all
  standard file descriptors in conjunction with all fopen() and fclose()
  operations on the TRACE log and redirections of stderr via equality
  statements (see 1997-12-16, 1997-12-13 and 1997-07-18 mods). - FM
1997-12-18 
* forgotten last } UN-inserted (John Line) - WB
* few commented messages corrected according to RFC2068 (HTTP1.1)
  (Leonid Pauzner) - WB
1997-12-17
* Changed all %i tokens to %d or %ld in functions that always get decimal
  values in their arguments. - FM
1997-12-17 (all patches by Leonid Pauzner)
* open text mode while writing lynx.rc and bookmarks files
  LYrcFile.c and LYBookmark.c (forgotten last } inserted). - WB
* add a comment about binary mode in LYMain.c and pile them 
  in one ifdef - WB
* few misprinted characters (in comments) corrected in
  \chrtrans\cp850_uni.tbl - WB
1997-12-16
* Further mods in LYClean.c (see 1997-12-13 mods) do block the
  *stderr = LYOrigStderr;  statement in cleanup() for VMS with VAXC. - FM
* Added an ELGOTO keystroke command, mapped by default to upper case 'E'
  (lower case 'e' still invokes the editor for the current document, if
  it is a local file), for passing the URL (or ACTION) of the current
  link to the line editor for editing as a goto URL.  Works like the
  ECGOTO ('G') keystroke command for editing the URL of the current
  document as a goto URL, i.e., if the URL is not modified, is set to
  a zero-length string, or ^G is entered, the command is cancelled. - FM
* Mods of LYMainLoop.c to disallow ECGOTO or ELGOTO commands for File
  Management (DIRED_SUPPORT) menu URLs. - FM
1997-12-15
* Added reporting of the Discard value (YES or NO), in the Cookie Jar Page
  (note that until we have code for storing cookies beyond the current
  session, Lynx behaves as if Discard were set, whether or not it was set
  by the server, but we still report the server's instructions, as we do
  for the Maximum Gobble Date). - FM
1997-12-14
* added a lynx.cfg switch to turn on/off extended dos translations for keys. 
  -WB
* added minor DOS tweaks by Doug Kaufman and myself. - WB
* fixed windows binary mode piping. - WB
1997-12-13
* Tweaks in LYList.c to make the link numbers correspond with those in
  the current document when LINKS_AND_FORM_FIELDS_ARE_NUMBERED in on,
  and to show the current document's URL in the display. - FM
* Mods in HTTP.c to show the body of a 305 return status instead of ever
  acting on it.  A number of security/privacy problems with this status
  are being discussed in the HTTP-WG, and it's likely to be dropped or
  deprecated in the next revision of the HTTP/1.1 specs. - FM
* Restored the v2.7.1 HTmmdecode() that's specific for iso-2022-jp in
  HTMIME.c.  We still only call it when HTCJK == JAPANESE, and the
  generalized version reportedly has problems. - FM
* Removed the *stderr = LYOrigStderr; statement from VMSexit() in LYCurses.c
  and added it to the if() claused section which closes the TRACE log file,
  if opened, in cleanup() of LYClean.c.  This is just a stab in the dark
  for dealing with reported problems on exit with VAXC on VAXen.  We may
  need to use freopen() for redirecting TRACE messages to a file for VAXC
  or VAXen (there's no apparent problem with the current code with DECC
  on VMS/AXP). - FM
* Added more function key cases to the keypad() mode switch() in LYgetch()
  of LYStrings.c.  We don't need them with this code set, but they may as
  well be there for completeness. - FM
* check for and use ncurses default-color extension, use to make the
  color-style configuration usable on xterm with white background. - TD
* add cases in LYgetch() for remaining VT220-compatible codes, reported
  by Michael Ritzert and FM.  - TD
* add configure test to see if slang can be linked without curses or
  termcap libraries, request by John Davis. - TD
* set umask in mkdirs.sh script to work around users who have set root's
  umask to 077. - TD
* split up install rule to install-bin, install-cfg, install-man and
  install-help. - TD
* suppress suffixes in top-level makefile so 'make' won't try to create
  a file named "install" from install.sh - TD 
* make $(CPPFLAGS) inherit consistently from top-level makefile. - TD
  (reported by Mark Mentovai)
* add configure option --enable-externs, to turn on USE_EXTERNS. - TD
* use explicit comparison for enum values, fix compile problem with VAX C
  for UCAux functions (reported by Brian Tillman). - TD
1997-12-03
* Remove CHANGES.configure, since it is redundant. - TD
* Make -g3 option check for OSF/1 3.2 consistent with -Olimit check. - TD
* Use 'result' rather than 'time' in mktime.c to avoid shadowing. - TD
* Use wborder only if configure finds it, not ifdef FANCY_CURSES. - PHDM
* List of systems having strerror replaced by configure test. - PHDM
* Beautifying of mktime.c (`now' was misleading). - PHDM
1997-12-02
* Mods in LYCookie.c to prompt whether to accept (or reject) cookies with
  an invalid domain value which yields a hostname prefix with a dot (as
  specified in section 4.3.2 of the IETF cookie drafts and RFC), rather
  than rejecting it silently.  Note that it is rejected in non-interactive
  (-dump or -source) mode, because the user can't be prompted. - FM
1997-11-27
* Added a PREPEND_BASE_TO_SOURCE configuration symbol in lynx.cfg which
  can be set FALSE to suppress prepending of a Request URL comment and
  BASE element to text/html sources retrieved for 'd'ownloading or passed
  to 'p'rint functions.  Note that this prepending is not done for -source
  dumps unless the -base switch also was included on the command line, and
  the latter switch overrides the setting of the PREPEND_BASE_TO_SOURCE
  configuration variable. - FM
1997-11-25
* Mods in LYMail.c and LYPrint.c to handle to=address(es), cc=address(es),
  subject=string, keywords=word_list, and body=message fields in the
  ?searchpart of mailto URLs as specified in the 1997-11-16 draft:
    ftp://ftp.isi.edu/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-mailto-url-03.txt
  The cc=address(es) values are now handled as a Cc: header, and a self
  copy, if confirmed on prompt, is added to the Cc: header.  Note that
  the draft now allows mailto:?to=address(es)[&foo=blah] as a format,
  i.e., without an address before the ?searchpart.  The Netscape
  ?searchpart tack-on broke all pre-existing implementations of mailto,
  and this breaks Lynx's support through v2.7.1.  Though it's now
  supported in this code set, don't use it.  Complaints and formal
  requests to provide this functionality via a new scheme (e.g.,
  mail: or smtp:) without breaking existing implementation of mailto:,
  including from TimBL (HimSelf :), thus far have fallen on deaf ears.
  You can send email to those deaf ears via:
  	mailto:masinter@parc.xerox.com%20(Larry%20Masinter)
  Don't allow the IETF backward compatibility principle to go down
  the drain. - FM
* Mods to support use of the PMDF SEND command on VMS in conjunction with
  a temporary header file, so that all headers specified in the ?searchpart
  of mailto URLs can be included in the mailing, and made that the compilation
  default in userdefs.h to go with the default MAIL_ADRS mask for PMDF (If
  the "generic" VMS MAIL utility is used, not all of the headers can be
  specified on the command line, as it requires).  Look at the code in
  LYMail.c and LYPrint.c that is used when isPMDF is TRUE as a model of how
  to do this with other header-file-capable VMS mailers (but I don't have
  any besides PMDF, and can't do it for you :). - FM
* Tweak of the 1997-11-17 URL parsing mods so that relative symbolic
  elements immediately preceding a ?searchpart are handled identically
  to when a ?searchpart is not present. - FM
* Added support for setting both SYSTEM_MAIL and SYSTEM_MAIL_FLAGS in
  both userdefs.h and lynx.cfg. - FM
1997-11-23
* integrate PHDM's patch. - TD
* Check for existence of sys/wait.h. - PHDM
* Do not include sys/stat.h twice. - PHDM
* New autoconf-macros to check if a function is declared after including a
  specific set of files. - PHDM
* Declare strstr if it is not declared by string.h. - PHDM
* Declare getgrgid and getgrnam if not declared by grp.h. - PHDM
* Provide strstr and mktime implementations, and use them if needed. - PHDM
* Always include sys/types.h in HTUtils.h. - PHDM
* define NO_GROUPS if we do not have getgroups. - PHDM
* define NEED_REMOVE also if test yields unknown. - PHDM
* define mode_t if not done by system include files. - PHDM (phdm@macqel.be)
* change CF_UNION_WAIT to use compile+link rather than compile, to ensure
  that we pick up the wait-macros rather than an implied function, which
  should fix configure problems on NeXT for Francisco A. Tomei Torres
  <fatomei2@mail.unm.edu>. - TD
* spelling nit from Larry Virden. - TD
* add osf3.0 to special case compiler options using -g3 in place of
  -O -g, from Harsh Kumar <harsh@krcl.ernet.in>. - TD
* remove redundant "-c" option from $(installbin) in makefile.in, reported
  by Michael Warner <warner@wsu.edu>, for OSF/1 4.0. - TD
* if configure --srcdir is not used, comment-out rmdir's in "make distclean"
  rule. - TD
* modify recent erase/clear change so that it applies only to FANCY_CURSES,
  since BSD curses does not otherwise clear the screen when restoring after
  popup. - TD
* modify change for boxes so this builds with BSD curses, which has no
  wborder() function. - TD
* reverse ifdef for NO_SIZECHANGEHACK to USE_SIZECHANGEHACK, which is
  normally off, since this code did not work with BSD 4.4 curses, SVr4
  curses, or ncurses 4.1 with xterm. (Will make a configure test if anyone
  can identify a configuration that works). - TD.
1997-11-21
* Changed LYE_LINKN to LYE_LKCMD (still mapped by default to Ctrl-V; may
  need to be entered twice for some systems) for invoking a prompt to
  enter any Lynx keystroke command when in form text fields. - FM
1997-11-20
* Added an LYK_CLEAR_AUTH command, mapped to underscore ('_') by default,
  which clears all authorization info for the current session.  This is
  recommended for the situation when one leaves one's terminal but doesn't
  want to end the browser session, nor want others to be able to retrieve
  protected documents with previously entered username and password info.
  Note that we don't yet have a way to block access to any protected
  documents which are still in cache. - FM
1997-11-19
* Tweak of HTTP.c to ensure closing of the connection when interrupted
  ('z'apped) on the first socket read. - FM
1997-11-18
* Mods to use the explicit label "Bad HTML:" in trace messages corresponding
  to BAD_HTML_USE_TRACE messages. - FM & KW
* Tweak of the restored TABLE-in-PRE block handling to deal with the
  case when it's encased in a CENTER or DIV with ALIGN="center". - FM
* Changed docs/README.defines to refer to INSTALLATION file - HN
1997-11-17
* Changed the default ASCII BOXVERT and BOXHORI definitions from '*' to
  to '|' and '-', and new function LYbox() for non-VMS (n)curses. - FM
* Use explicitly specified characters for drawing the corners of popup
  boxes with non-VMS (n)curses if we have also specified characters for
  vertical and horizontal lines. - KW
* Mods in HTTP.c to trim any "LYNXIMGMAP:" leader from Referer header
  values and strip the #fragment when making http(s) requests via links
  in the pseudo-documents constructed for MAP elements. - FM & KW
* Mods of SGML parsing to better handle SELECT blocks with invalid markup,
  in effect for both TagSoup and SortaSGML parsing (for the latter just
  in case it doesn't already prevent invalid markup from being passed on). 
  Only OPTION elements are accepted in SELECT blocks.
  Otherwise, if the element is a form-related start tag, the
  SELECT block is closed and the new form-related element is started.
  All other elements are ignored.  A FORM end or start tag ends any open
  SELECT block and the current FORM (before starting another FORM if
  it is a start tag).  Note that we now support SELECT blocks outside
  of FORM blocks, which some providers are using for "informational"
  popups, but no Lynx user would do anything that awful, right? - FM
* Tweak in LYMainLoop.c to override an LYresubmit_posts flag if we are
  reloading a popped document due to a NOT_FOUND or NULLFILE return
  value from getfile(). - FM
  (But if the document that would be loaded after such a failure has POST
  data and is not in memory, still jump to the PREV_DOC code, see enttry
  for 1997-11-03. - KW)
* Worked in a variant of AJL's suggestion of setting LINES and COLUMNS
  artificially high before the initscr() call with Unix curses, then
  using a dummy call to size_change() for setting LYlines and LYcols
  to the actual screen dimensions, so that increases in the screen size
  during the Lynx session, and not just decreases, can be handled.
  Note that one still needs to do a RELOAD (^R) overtly to create a
  new HText structure based on the current screen size. - FM
  (The new code can be disabled by defining NO_SIZECHANGEHACK, in case
  some curses version or terminal cannot deal with it. - KW)
* Tweaks of the chartrans code. - FM & KW
* Change in HTNews.c to ignore very long bogus newsgroup names when listing
  available groups. - KW
* Tweaks in code for highlighting search text in anchors, to better deal with
  terminals in UTF-8 mode. - KW
* Mods to ignore anything past a '?' character when simplifying URL paths,
  as is now more clearly specified in the Fielding URL draft.  Note that
  we still assume a ';' is not in fact a parameter delimiter, or won't
  have a value with characters that could be misinterpreted as relative
  path specs. - FM
* Increased the redirection limit to the original Lynx's value of 10,
  because the HTTP/1.1 draft no longer will restrict it to 5, but instead
  will leave it to the discretion of the browser (and I like 10, as a
  reminder of the "good old days" :). - FM
1997-11-15
* Mods of parsing in HTML.c to restore support for the TABLE-in-PRE-block
  HTML kludge described in http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~flavell/tablejob.html,
  which stopped working in conjunction with the 1997-05-21 mods (see below)
  for treating TABLEs as DIVisions to support ALIGNment attributes in TABLE
  markup.  The PRE-in-TABLE-block HTML kludge was not affected by those mods
  but works only with the TagSoup parsing mode. - FM & KW
1997-11-12
* Made handling of the 'x' in hexadecimal character references (&#xH;)
  case insensitive, as for the "alphabetic digits" (a-f, A-F). - FM
* Added a LINKN command key in the line editor, mapped to Ctrl-V, for
  invoking the F_LINK_NUM prompt when in form text fields.  Ctrl-V is
  still a dead key under other circumstances in the line editor. - FM
* remove options --with-lss-file and --with-cfg-file, since the corresponding
  files will always be installed under $(libdir), reported by Henry Eric
  Nelson (HN).  - TD
* modify configure script and makefile templates to permit builds with the
  --srcdir option, noted by Philippe De Muyter. - TD
1997-11-08
* Added Unicode support for "DosArabic (cp864)", "WinArabic (cp1256)",
  "DosGreek (cp737)", "DosGreek2 (cp869)", "WinGreek (cp1253)",
  "DosHebrew (cp862)", and "WinHebrew (cp1255)".  Note that we still
  have no code for taking DIR attributes, or directionality in general,
  into account. - FM
* Mods to handle "cp-#" charset names as synonyms for "cp#", and some
  cp# names as synonyms for "windows-#". FM & KW
1997-11-07
* Change of LY_SLrefresh() in LYCurses.c as suggested by JED - FM
* add logic to make install-directories as needed. - TD
* remove --disable-char-trans option (ifdef's still remain). - TD
* correct type used in first compile-test for union wait. - TD
* correct order of deletions in "make distclean" rule. - TD
* new versions of macros used to check for ncurses version. - TD
* don't suppress -I/usr/local/include when checking -I/usr/local/include/*,
  to accommodate older versions of gcc. - TD
1997-11-06
* Use erase() instead of clear() in some places, to avoid unnecessary full
  screen repainting even for UNIX (and similar) curses.  Renamed LY_SLclear
  to LY_SLerase, but it is used for erase() and clear() now, so there should
  be no change in behavior for slang introduced by this. - KW
* Added new format for lines in chartrans .tbl files: U+NNNN "a string" where
  the string can have C backslash-escaped characters.  This allows to write
  replacement strings with 8-bit characters that won't be garbled when the
  .tbl files are transferred in some non-binary way.  Note there is no ':'
  between the Unicode value and the beginning quote character. - KW
* Changes to HTMLDTD.c (for SortaSGML parsing) and HTML.c (second line of
  defense) for dealing with invalid SELECT tags.  Also tolerate SELECT
  outside of forms. - KW
* Change in HTLocalName for DOSPATH so that it doesn't depend on whether
  HTDOS_name returns a pointer to static memory or not. - KW
* Started new file docs/README.defines.  Renamed CHANGES to CHANGES2-7,
  removed duplicate 2-7-1 entries.  Minor changes to INSTALLATION, other
  files.  CHANGES.chartrans is gone. - KW
* Tweaked color style stuff again.  Statusline may behave better. - KW
* Don't use memmove for HEAD in HTNews.c. - KW
* For UNIX, use normal umask permissions, instead of the extra-cautious temp
  file permissions, for files saved to disk by the default actions for PRINT
  and DOWNLOAD. - KW
* Changes (untested) in the code dealing with reading of compressed files in
  HTFile.c, in parallel to the code for other systems. - KW
* Mods to avoid va_start redefinition warnings when building with slang. - FM
1997-11-05
* Change in LYForms.c to avoid full screen repaint after popup is retracted
  for slang. - KW & FM
1997-11-03
* Internal links code revised.  Some details follow, but first a summary
  of the basic premises.  Links in a document given as href="#fragment" or
  href="" (empty, but href attribute is present) mean something different
  from href="url#fragment" or href="url" (where url is a non-empty absolute
  or relative URL not including a fragment), they are internal links pointing
  to an element or a location within the same copy of the document (or to the
  document itself, for href="").  In contrast, a URL-Reference with a non-
  empty URL refers to a (generally...) external resource.  If the "url"
  happens to coincide with (or, if it is relative, resolve to) the URL from
  which the current document was retrieved, the current document is a 
  representation of the resource, but not the same thing.  In most such cases
  we can treat href="#fragment" and href="url#fragment" the same way, i.e.
  activating such a link is interpreted as a request to reposition within
  the current document; we are using the current document as a cache copy
  of the resource (like we would other documents in the memory cache).  But
  if we have marked our copy as no-cache, it seems more consistent to treat
  activation of a href="url#fragment" link as a request for retrieving a
  new copy and _then_ locating #fragment in it, as we do for "any-other-url
  #fragment" if we have cached a document which represents "any-other-url"
  and which is marked no-cache.  Following a href="" link should just result
  in repositioning to the start of the document, not in a new retrieval for
  no-cache documents.
  If the current document is the result of a POST submission, there is in
  general no way to refer to its underlying resource with a URL, since there
  is no URL notation for "url+post_data".  Internal links can be used within
  the context of this document, but there is no way to hyperlink to it or
  parts of it from "outside".  A link to a href="url" or href="url#fragment"
  target should always imply a GET retrieval, whether it occurs within a
  document from a POST submission or not, for consistency.
  This understanding also applies to other than <A href=..> uses of URL-
  References in documents, for example the link implied between a USEMAP
  attribute and a MAP element; but not to all uses, for example a FORM's
  ACTION requires an external resource and not an internal reference, so
  ACTION="" is resolved to an absolute URL (using a base URL if one is
  given).
  The semantics for URL-less URL-References are given in Internet Draft
  <http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/url/draft-fielding-url-syntax-09.txt>,
  including that "Traversal of such a reference should not result in an 
  additional retrieval action."  No comparable prescriptions are made for
  references which have a URL, in particular it is not stated that they
  should be treated as equivalent when the URL coincides with or resolves
  to the current document's retrieval URL.
  The changes to the Lynx code attempt to implement what is outlined above,
  by keeping track of how a link destination was originally specified. href=
  "#fragment" and href="" links are still "resolved" into a "url#fragment"
  and "url" form, for use internally, and if an explicit NOCACHE action is
  requested, and for generating lists of links etc., and in general for use
  outside of the context of the current document.
  To the best of my knowledge they do not lead to unwanted (or misdirected)
  resubmission of POST content without prompting the user for confirmation
  (although the prompt texts probably need improvement). - KW
* The notion of the context of the "current document" is extended, so that
  auxiliary LYNXIMGMAP documents generated by Lynx are within the scope of
  the underlying document, i.e. the document containing the MAP and AREA
  elements.  Although they are treated as separate documents for display
  and internal handling, following links between the underlying document
  and its LYNXIMGMAP documents will result in display from cached data
  (if available) even for no-cache documents, if a fragment-only (or empty)
  URL-Reference was used in the HTML.  This includes the link generated for
  pointing from the IMG to the LYNXIMGMAP if the USEMAP attribute value was
  was fragment-only; the LYNXIMGMAP is normally regenerated from the list
  of MAP and AREA elements kept internally when a link to it is activated.
  (Note that a LYNXIMGMAP screen is still not reloaded from external sources
  even when RELOAD or NOCACHE keys are used, if data for the MAP is found
  in the internal list; but that reloading the underlying document will
  refresh the internal lists.) - KW
* List Page screens are also in the context of the underlying document, so
  that internal links in the underlying document can be listed and activated
  from the List Page.  When following an internal link from a List Page, it
  is not pushed on the history stack (similar to the History List Page), to
  reduce the chance of confusion when walking back through history. - KW
* LYNXIMGMAP and List Page auxiliary documents can now be associated with
  POST data.  This does not mean that the data is posted to a "LYNXIMGMAP:"
  or "file:" URL, which is impossible; but that the underlying document is
  associated with the POST data.  This way these aux documents can still
  have links regarded as "internal" pointing to the document of which they
  are logically a part, keeping track of what POST data are applicable if
  several form submissions have occurred.  Normally the underlying document
  should be in the document cache when such a link is activated, so that
  resubmission of the POST can be overridden.  If it is not found,
  resubmission may happen after user confirmation.  Although the POST data
  content is not shown on such aux pages, it can be inspected with the INFO
  ('=') command.  Note that the association of LYNXIMGMAPs and List Pages
  with POST data automatically excludes them from various operations which
  may otherwise be possible, such as bookmarking or inclusion in the
  'V'isited Links Page.  Note also that such aux pages are treated internally
  as different documents from their POST-free counterparts with the same
  address, which might be generated for example after typing the address
  at a 'g'oto prompt while viewing a different text.  It may be possible to
  generate confusing situations, but regenerating the displayed data (by
  invoking 'L'IST again, or by following a LYNXIMGMAP: link) will always
  show the currently applicable information.
  For image maps, the change implements link-following capabilities which
  come naturally to graphical UAs, which can handle IMG USEMAP and the
  corresponding MAP elements from the same data stream as objects within
  the same document instance. - KW
* To implement the above, MAP and AREA information from a POST response is
  not kept in the global list shared by all other documents, but in a separate
  list specific to the underlying (containing) document and the POST data.
  The specific lists are managed with the underlying document's anchor
  structure so that they can automatically expire after the anchor is removed
  from memory and will not stay around and accumulate until session end. - KW
* POST data is kept in mainloop when following an internal link, but is now
  always dropped for links that were given with a URL.  This removes the
  limitation by which a link in a POST response to the URL of the POST
  submission script would be inappropriately converted to a resubmission of
  the POST data.  (example: search form from <http://www.marshall.edu/htbin/
  calendar>) - KW
* Changes to the PREV_DOC handling in mainloop.  When encountering documents
  that may need to be reloaded while walking back in history, because they
  have POST data associated and are not marked "safe" and are either not found
  in the memory cache or -resubmit_posts has been set, the user is prompted
  for confirmation as before; if the reply is 'n' the document will be skipped
  but if the user cancels with ^G the walkback operation is cancelled and the
  currently viewed document remains loaded.  Some of the aux documents which
  can new be associated with POST data may be automatically skipped if their
  document structures are not any more in memory. - KW
* When following a link marked internal from a List Page and confirmation is
  required, ^G may also have the different effect of cancelling the operation
  while responding 'n' may attempt to follow the link as a GET request (i.e.
  with POST data dropped). - KW
* In some situations, automatic popping from the history stack in mainloop
  after getfile fails to load a new document could lead to resubmission of
  a previous POST request without prompting.  This is now avoided by jumping
  to the code handling PREV_DOC. - KW
* Use new LYinternal_flag variable for propagating info to HTAccess, rather
  than overloading LYoverride_no_cache. - KW
* Tweaks for bad form tag soup with crashes on unclosed SELECT.  Changes in
  HTML.c and GridText.c to prevent memory leaks resulting from insanely
  placed or unclosed form field tags, hopefully not introducing other
  problems... - KW
1997-11-02
* Changes in HTParse's scan to leave additional '#' characters alone after
  the first has been found when scanning (from left) for fragments, and
  to apply the "don't treat '#' as start of a fragment for some kinds of
  URLs" hack only when the '#' will become part of what has been scanned
  as a path.  NNTP articles with more than '#' in the message-id are now
  accessible with the "news:" or "nntp:" schemes.  We should actually always
  escape when generating URLs and unescape when parsing them instead. - KW
* Changed HTUnEscape to leave '%' alone if not followed by two valid hex
  digits. - KW
* Allow the HEAD key and -head and -mime_header flags for "lynxcgi:" URLs
  and for "news:" and "nntp:" URLs that specify a single news article. - KW
* Change to writing of POST data in LYCgi.c, to close file descriptor after
  done writing and before reading as suggested by mhw@bcs.org.uk (Mark
  H. Wilkinson), and to check status from the write() call and retry if
  needed.  Note that the code is not appropriate for handling large
  amounts of POST data, since it still first does all the writing and
  then all the reading. - KW
1997-11-01
* Added support for presentation of text/plain files in SOURCE ('\') mode,
  homologously to text/html files, rather than treating the command as a
  synonym for 'd'ownload when viewing a text/plain file.  Note that if the
  text/plain file has no long lines, the display of it will not change,
  but otherwise, the long lines will not be wrapped in SOURCE mode, and
  thus can be 'p'rinted without line wrapping.  One still should use
  'd'ownload for a faithful copy of the file, i.e., without charset
  conversions and expansions of TABs. - FM
1997-10-30
* Get numbering of links on List Page right, by faking hidden links for
  form fields which get counted but are not selectable. - KW
* Allow LYNXHIST: links in List Page since the History Page may get 
  'L'isted... - KW
* Mods of HTML.c parsing to close any open Anchor or emphasis elements
  at the starts of TABLE elements, as the Big Two's TABLE handlers appear
  to do now. - FM
* Tweaks of charset handling via META elements and CHARSET attributes. - FM
1997-10-29
* Tweak of SortaSGML DTD for insane HTML with FORM start before HEAD. - KW
* Prevent memory leaks from HTChunks for option and textarea with very
  bad markup, added TRACE and BAD_HTML_USE_TRACE warnings for those. - KW
* Don't call tigetnum("ncv") for _WINDOWS - BD
* Added Unicode tables for the "DEC Multinational", "Macintosh (8 bit)",
  and "NeXT character set" display character sets. - FM 
1997-10-28
* Disable setting of the `reloading' flag in HTLoadDocument which would
  generate no-cache headers for request where this is not appropriate. - KW
* Memory leak for first OPTION in SELECT removed. - KW
* Changed HTDOS_name to not return pointer to static area. - Binh Do
  <bdo@mailman.epnet.com>
* Changes to INSTALLATION file. - HN
* Fix in HTMIME.c to recognize Content-location. - KW
1997-10-27
* Don't disable FORMs that have INPUTs with TYPE="file" or TYPE="range"
  since those fields may be optional and the rest of the FORM may be
  valid to submit. - FM
* Updated links to www.w3.org in help files. - KW
* Some changes for DOS compilation. - DK
* Changes to INSTALLATION file. - HN
* Tweaks of internal links stuff. - KW
* Allow HEAD on URLs starting with LYNXIMGMAP:http by stripping the
  prefix. - KW
* Reverted LYCheckForCSI() to previous incarnation. - KW
1997-10-26
* If compiled with -DDONT_TRACK_INTERNAL_LINKS, behavior with respect to
  internal links as in FM's code. - KW
* Some chartrans tweaks. - KW
1997-10-25
* Changes to INSTALLATION file. - HN
* Make temp file names conform to 8+3 naming convention for DOS, and
  give LYNX_TEMP_SPACE priority over TEMP and TMP for DOS. - DK
* Create temp file names with '-' char as separator between pid and
  sequential number for non-8+3 systems, to prevent (unlikely)
  collision. - KW
1997-10-24
* Change in HTML.c to use the base (rather than current document, if the
  base differs) in all cases for form ACTIONs (i.e., if the ACTION is
  empty, or has a lone fragment, or an ACTION attribute is not included)
  as specified in the -07 to -09 Fielding URL drafts. - FM
1997-10-23
* Fixed a few typos and glued together a few URLs to make it easier for
  folk to cut and paste them, in the new INSTALLATION file. - LVW
1997-10-22
* Many locations of files changed, about_lynx/ directory and references to
  aboutfilepath removed, userdefs.h reorganized, changed README, new 
  INSTALLATION file, doc changes, some doc files removed. - HN
  (Removed paragraph in README which doesn't apply yet, some files still
  not done - KW)
* Patch to WWW/Library/djgpp/makefile - WS
* Added entity names from HTML 4.0 draft to extra entities in HTMLDTD.c - KW
* Understand lists in ACCEPT-CHARSET attributes.  Added a list of forms
  to GridText structure (currently underused). - KW
* Don't try to use box drawing chars in UTF-8 display mode. - KW
* Changed chartrans mechanism (UCdomap.c, makeuctb.c) so that the "default"
  translation table is now used as a fallback for other translation tables.
  This also applies to display character sets which do not have a chartrans
  table file but are listed in LYCharSets.c.  Changed syntax of table files
  (see src/chrtrans/README.format), added a keyword to disable using the
  fallback.  Currently def7_uni (corresponding to "7 bit approximations"
  and the MIME charset "us-ascii") is used as default table, as before;
  but previously the default table didn't have any real meaning.
  Conceptually every translation table (unless it disables fallback) is
  extended as if it included all the replacements from the default table.
  Note that mappings for some characters in the default table file still
  differ from the old mappings given in LYCharSets.c, and what is displayed
  e.g. for umlaut characters may not be consistent, this still has to be
  sorted out.  It may just have become more visible now. - KW
* Tweaks to some replacement strings in def7_uni.tbl; contributions of
  more useful strings would be welcome... - KW
* Removed mappings for invalid chars from some chartrans files, removed
  Ethiopic chars from iso01_uni.tbl. - KW
* Some other corrections and tweaks for chartrans mechanisms. - KW
1997-11-21
* Fixed handling of Control-D (delete character under the cursor) in the
  line editor when the cursor is at the end of the line instead of on a
  character in the string being edited. - FM
* revised tests for wait/waitpid/union-wait. - TD
* correct/update handling of default prefix in CF_WITH_PATH macro, used for
  parsing --with-cfg-file and --with-lss-file options.  - TD
* add uninstall target to top-level makefile. - TD
* remove redundant install options from $(INSTALL_DATA). - TD
* add configure --with-lss-file option.
* minor cleanup of gcc warnings, ifdefs. - TD
1997-10-20
* Mods in the CSO/PH gateway to set the anchor's safe flag to TRUE so the
  user need not be bothered with confirmation prompts on resubmissions of
  the search form. - FM
* Tweaked the break point setting code in GridText.c for CJK di-bytes
  so that one is set after a recognized "ESC(" ISO 2022 escape sequence
  has been found. - FM
1997-10-16
* Tweaks to recognition of Japanese (better recognize x-euc-*), and to
  the mechanism in GridText.c keeping track of which encoding is used for
  Japanese.  The state for this is now reset on explicit '\n' and '\r'
  received by the HText object in addition to space chars. - KW
* Tweaks in HTTP.c to avoid access to uninitialized memory and pacify
  paranoid dbx. - KW
* Try to more consistently remember the charset in effect for a document
  when going to SOURCE view, using new LYUC{Push,Pop}Assumed functions.
  Note that this is only in effect immediately when switching to SOURCE
  view; any later reloading while within SOURCE view (including those
  caused by RELOAD, RAW_TOGGLE and other keys, or by Options Screen changes)
  may still revert to the usual assumption about charset, which means a
  charset specified in a META tag may be forgotten at that point; this may
  be considered a feature... - KW
* Refer to TagSoup and SortaSGML parsing (coined by FM), rather than "old"
  and "new" DTD. - KW
* Made some of the changes concerning and removal and location changes of
  files proposed by HN. - KW
* Restored LYCheckForCSI example function to its previous form, with a check
  added and comments added. - KW 
1997-10-15
* Changed the order of display character set entries for the options menu
  popup.  "ISO Latin 1" and its "DosLatin1 (cp850)" and "WinLatin1 (cp1252)"
  equivalents come first, then the system-based charsets (note that I
  changed "IBM PC character set" to "DosLatinUS (cp437)"), then the CJK
  and Vietnamese charsets, then "Other ISO Latin" (probably don't need
  that one any more), then the known ISO 8859-# charsets with their
  homologs (e.g, Dos and Win Cyrillic and KOI8-R) in groups, then
  "UNICODE UTF 8" and the Unicode mnemonic charsets. - FM
* Various fixes for color style code, should prevent memory corruption. - KW
* Some LYCharUtils.c cleanup. - KW
* Added some of the changes from fotemods to SGML.c, especially handling of
  &zwnj; as allowing a line break, and conversion to UNICODE UTF-8. - KW
* Mods in code handling mailcap lines, to avoid access to invalid memory. - KW
1997-10-12
* Added LYLeakSACopy and LYLeakSACat to LYLeaks.c.  Running Lynx compiled
  with LY_FIND_LEAKS defined will now give the source locations where
  StrAllocCopy and StrAllocCat are used, if those create leaks.  Added
  missing include of LYLeaks.h in LYCookie.c. - KW
* More heavy tweaks in LYCharUtils.c.  Associated changes in HTChunk.c
  (new functions), small change for -raw (in connection with attribute
  values) in SGML_character.  LYCharUtils.c is still a work in
  progress... - KW
* Tweaks to allow some chars as data input (0x97, 0x9b, 0xa0) if the
  current display character set seems to have those values as printable
  characters (by testing LYlowest_eightbit[]). - KW
1997-10-11
* Mods in HTFTP.c to recognize NetPresenz server (variation of AppleShare
  claiming to be Peter Lewis server?, try current ftp://www.unicode.org/),
  and to show server's identification from initial greeting on info
  screen for FTP URLs.  Other cosmetic changes in HTFTP.c. - KW
* Fixed various memory leaks. - KW
* Some more minor cleanup tweaks for color style code. - KW
* Avoid unnecessary pauses if TRACE is on and a Trace Log file is in use. - KW
1997-10-10
* Renamed lynx_help/keystroke_commands/ directory to lynx_help/keystrokes/
  for the benefit of DOS, and changed references accordingly. - KW
* Changed parsing of command line options for -lss file, it should now
  be used and override the default from userdefs.h or environment variables
  as advertised. - KW
* More tweaks and cleanup in HText_SubmitForm. - KW
* Code to recover from memory exhaustion, sometimes.  The requests for
  dynamic memory which heuristically most often fail for lack of memory
  when rendering large documents are the calloc() calls in split_line.
  They are replaced by LY_check_calloc() which has the same calling
  conventions as calloc() but additionally checks if "enough" memory is
  available for the requested amount plus some margin and tries some
  remedial action if this is not the case.  The additional safety margins
  are required to make it likely that other allocation requests in other
  places of the program won't fail before the next check.  The actions
  which may be taken in order to avoid exiting if low memory is detected:
  (1) Try to unload cached documents (other than the one currently being
  loaded), until we seem to have enough memory.  (2) If that fails (or
  there are no other documents cached in memory), try to fake a 'Z' key
  interruption; this will have the same effect as if the user had pressed
  'Z' so it will only detected if some other part of the program tests
  HTCheckForInterrupt() and acts on it.  (3) If this seems not to be
  sufficient to stop loading, halt appending of normal text data to the
  document structure (A warning *** MEMORY EXHAUSTED *** is appended
  instead). - KW
* A tweak of color style memory allocation. - KW
1997-10-09
* Some more tweaks from FM for VMS build - KW
* For DJGPP compilation, src/chrtrans/makefile.dos - WS (Bill Schiavo
  <Wschiavo@concentric.net>)
* Some cleanup in Hext_SubmitForm (needs more). Start using ACCEPT-CHARSET
  (doesn't recognize list yet, only recognized if on the INPUT field that
  causes submission). - KW
* Added two test files for iso-8859-2 charset. - KW
* Tweaks in LYMainLoop.c for various keys that page up, to better preserve
  keep the current link selected if possible and to correct a glitch with
  UP_LINK. - KW
* Reorder text/html and text/plain to the beginning of HTPresentations list,
  so they will be found more quickly and will appear at the beginning of
  Accept request header fields. - KW
1997-10-08
* add logic to implement mouse button 2 "previous document" for
  ncurses configuration. - TD
* add dependencies on 'lynx' to top-level 'all' and 'install' rules
  in makefile.in - TD
* add osf4.0 to special case compiler options using -g3 in place of
  -O -g, for Heikki Kantola <hezu@iki.fi>. - TD
* correct some of the uninitialized-variable warnings. - TD
* Removed the compilation of the old libwww-FM HTAlert.c module for VMS,
  as previously removed for Unix. - FM
* Added comments and tweaks of build.com, build-slang.com and libmake.com,
  (and a complementary tweak of tcp.h) to make more clear how compiler
  definitions and compiler and linker options can be added. - FM
1997-10-07
* Changed PROBLEMS file for ^Z and for "forgetting emphasis of link text"
  problem (which shouldn't occur any more). - KW
1997-10-05
* Changed SGML.c parsing of unrecognized and invalid start tags. If the
  '<' character in HTML is followed by a 7-bit letter character, we now
  do tag parsing even if the element name is not recognized, instead of
  going to 'S_junk_tag' mode, so that a '>' embedded in an attribute value
  (which may also be part of a CJK character's encoding) will not
  prematurely end the tag.  (But "soft double-quotes parsing" mode is
  recognized.)  Treat a '<' followed by most other 7-bit chars as data,
  i.e. recover it and the following char. - KW
1997-10-04
* Corrected check for empty string at beginning of LYUnEscapeEntities. - KW
* Squeezed option for "Assume charset if unknown:" into Options screen.
  It is selected with a control char (^A), is only available in Advanced User
  mode, and the value is currently not saved into .lynxrc with '>', i.e.
  for a persistent change lynx.cfg has to be modified (or use an alias or,
  for DOS, a batch file to call lynx with -assume_charset=...).  The
  interaction with the Raw M(O)de setting may be confusing (or confused :) ),
  and it is possible to set nonsensical values that have no effect. - KW
* Changed order and criteria of transformation attempts in HTPlain.c to
  be more like SGML.c.  For plain text KOI8-R would use 8-bit stripping
  to early.  HTPlain_write still is too different from SGML_character... - KW
* Reinstate the slash after special interpretation of /~ at beginning of 
  file URL path for DOSPATH - DK 
* Changed SGML_character to not try to convert attribute values to UTF-8
  if HTCJK is in effect (arrggh!) - KW
* Changed effect of -raw / '@' for CJK display character sets: it now toggles
  the effective charset assumption between that specified with ASSUME_CHARSET
  or -assume_charset (or iso-8859-1 if none given) and the charset that
  corresponds to the selected display character set, as for non-CJK.  An
  exception is made if both charsets are CJK charsets, so that the toggle
  will still have the function of toggling CJK mode on and off.  Explicitly
  specifying a CJK charset as assumed is currently not very useful, since we
  cannot translate from that to other character sets. - KW
* Oh, by the way: compilation without defining EXP_CHARTRANS won't work any
  more.  Regard #ifdef EXP_CHARTRANS as some strange kind of comment for
  now, until it goes away. - KW
* Write comment at top of .lynxrc file to make clear that it is different
  from lynx.cfg, suggested by LWV. - KW 
1997-09-30
* Changed order of display character sets on options screen a bit, and
  corrected charset listings in lynx.cfg and userdefs.h files - KW
* Added comment on lynx.lss in userdefs.h, moved it. - KW
1997-09-27
* Made TRACE messages which correspond to BAD_HTML_USE_TRACE warnings stand
  out more by decorating them with ***** characters, so that users who
  follow the BAD_HTML_USE_TRACE advice can more easily find the relevant
  messages. - KW
* Reworked LYUnEscapeEntities() while loop into a (hopefully) more 
  understandable and consistent state-based switch, and integrated
  LYUnEscapeToLatinOne functionality. - KW
* Non-ASCII characters in URLs and similar strings encountered in the HTML.c
  processing (previously handled by LYUnEscapeToLatinOne) are now generally
  URL-encoded, instead of doing this just for 8-bit characters which are
  the result of entity expansion.  There is no clear standard definition what
  non-ASCII characters in URLs in HTML attributes (HREF etc.) actually mean,
  especially if the transmission character encoding is something else than
  iso-8859-1.  Leaving them as the raw byte values as received runs against
  the HTML i18n view that the transmission encoding is distinct from the
  document character set and has to be (conceptually at least) decoded before
  SGML parsing.  It also won't work in general for entities that expand to
  to Unicode characters which cannot be expressed at all in the currently
  effective (or assumed) charset, and would lead to problems with displaying
  URLs on the statusline or representing them in auxiliary screens or bookmark
  files.  So now we try to first transform to the document charset "as usual"
  (undo the transmission encoding), then translate the Unicode value into a
  sequence of (one or more) byte values which are then URL-encoded.  Since
  character values > 255 cannot be expressed in a byte, always use UTF-8
  for them.  It may not be what the author intended, but should be at least
  consistent between internal (fragment) HREFs and NAME (or ID) attributes
  in the same document or set of documents.  Since this is dealing with
  bytes currently disallowed in URLs, it falls under error recovery.  But
  the handling should be roughly in line with current Internet Drafts
  (draft-masinter-url-i18n-00.txt, draft-duerst-query-i18n-00.txt,
  draft-ietf-ftpext-intl-ftp-02.txt).
  For character values < 256 (but > 127) this isn't currently consistently
  done, we may still be URL-escaping the byte value without UTF-8 encoding.
  - KW
1997-09-25
* Integrated the attribute and form field translation stuff from separate
  code line.  This is still a rough attempt.  Needs testing and refinement,
  for various character set situations, expect glitches and bugs. - KW
1997-09-24
* Removed the compilations of the old libwww-FM HTInit.c and HTFWriter.c
  modules for VMS, as previously removed for Unix. - FM
* Added other changes from FM's feedback for VMS. - KW
* Fixed a bug in the SGML unescaping of OPTION values. - FM
* Fixed a bug in the SGML unescaping of TEXTAREA text. - KW
1997-09-23
* Fixed file 'E'dit command from dired directory listing, which I had
  broken in 2.7.1ac-0.69. - KW
* Added -width=NUMBER option to specify line width for non-interactive
  formatting (-dump output).  Also used by -preparsed source mode. - KW
* Changed suffix mapping mechanism to deal with "real" content-encoding
  parameters (gzip, compress) in addition to 7bit, 8bit, and binary.  Added
  a new field for brief descriptive text, so that the MIME type doesn't have
  to be abused for this purpose, but left most settings in HTInit.c unchanged
  for now. - KW
* Changes in HTFWriter.c and HTFile.c so that we don't forget the file type
  and encoding information we already have for a compressed file when passing
  control to HTLoadFile (possibly after uncompression). - KW
* Introduced FNAMES_8_3 symbol (for DOS 8+3 file system), and HTML_SUFFIX
  which should be defined as ".htm" for DOS and ".html" otherwise.  Various
  tweaks to deal with systems with 8+3 restricted filenames, in general and
  in connection with uncompression. - KW
* Applied diffs from FM for VMS, compared with recent fotemods. - KW
1997-09-21
* Use 0.01 rather than 0.001 as the q value for inserted iso-8859-1 and
  us-ascii charset parameters in Accept-Charset headers. - FM
* Added internal buffering of I.value elements in HTML_start_element()
  of HTML.c. - FM
1997-09-20
* Show HTTP header for all 2xx status codes (including 204-206) if requested
  with HEAD or -head. - KW
1997-09-19
* Modified the Unix "strange character" filter in exec_ok() of LYGetFile.c
  to allow '+', '&' and '=' characters. - FM
* minor ifdef/declaration fixes required to build on IRIX 6.2,
  SunOS (K&R) and VAX C. - TD
1997-09-18
* Try again after interrupted waitpid() in LYLoadCGI(), as in LYExecv() - KW
* Tweak in LYKeymap.c to bypass the isalpha() test for non-ASCII values,
  including values > 255 mapped to arrow keys, etc., when generating the
  'k'eymap display. - KW
* Changes to prevent many (but not all) compiler warnings about `const'.
  Not that this is different from TD's recent changes. Also some other minor
  tweaks relating to (gcc) compiler warnings. - KW
1997-09-17
* Mods in GridText.c to use HTEscapeSP() for space-to-plus conversions of
  name fields, and not just value fields, in submitted form content.  Note
  that some CGI scripts may still be doing plus-to-space restorations only
  for value fields, and only hex unescaping for name fields, while others
  may not be hex unescaping the name fields, so we may as well follow the
  specs fully (and cross our fingers :). - KW & FM
* merge symbols 'has_color' and 'lynx_has_color' to simplify ifdef's,
  and correct a problem building color-style configuration. - TD
* add configure symbol for ifdef'ing presence of waitpid, which
  was stopping build on HP-UX. - TD
* correct the symbol that is defined by CF_SIZECHANGE test, noted
  by failure to build SCO version after making an include for
  <sys/ioctl.h> ifdef'd according to configure test. - TD
* corrected check for broken (pre-1.9.9g) ncurses versions so that
  they can build with color support. - TD
* cache state of CF_NETLIBS so that rerunning configure will yield
  the same results for network libraries. - TD
* Add configure test for HP-UX -lHcurses library. - TD
* Minor adjustments to names of configure-script variables, to make
  them the same as other programs (e.g., tin-unoff). - TD
1997-09-16
* Added code to JKT's and KW's mods in LYPrint.c to also handle VMS:
  set the document's title as a logical on VMS (can be accessed via 
  f$trnlnm("LYNX_PRINT_TITLE") in scripts). - FM
* Smaller cleanups here and there - FM & KW
97-09-15
* Recover from bad sequence "<=" in SGML.c by outputting those characters
  literally. - KW
* Try again after interrupted waitpid() in LYExecv(). - JED
* Some tweaks in new DTD, some doc typo corrections. - KW
97-09-13
* Changes in LYConvertToURL() for better handling of the case when the
  pathname of the current directory (when Lynx is invoked) contains
  unusual, URL-reserved characters (especially '#') and we test for
  a relative but URL-encoded path. (no change for VMS) - KW
97-09-13
* Changes in LYStrings.c to enable keypad() processing for non-NCURSES
  if HAVE_KEYPAD is defined. - KW
97-09-12
* Correct mismatch/omission of HAVE_TYPE_UNIONWAIT symbol from
  change for wait vs waitpid. - TD
97-09-11
* Tweaks in HTMLGen.c for display of special characters and line breaking
  with -preparsed. - KW
* Got rid of use of underlining together with reverse for non-current 
  links for (n)curses if color is not used. - KW
* Small HTMLDTD.c changes for new parsing. - KW
* Change in SGML.c to always recognize SOFT HYPHEN when given as &#173. - KW
97-09-10
* Modify CF_WITH_PATH to allow substitution of --libdir and other
  configure options pathnames, e.g., for --with-cfg-file. - TD
* Include lynx_cfg.h in userdefs.h to resolve redefinition reported by
  AC. - TD
* Remove Ultrix/sony_news -specific ifdef's for curses headers,
  replace with configure-tests. - TD
* Remove AIX/NeXT/sony_news -specific ifdef's for wait vs waitpid,
  replace with configure-tests. - TD
* Add/use CF_HELP_MESSAGE macro to visually break down the very long
  help message into sections. - TD
* Move the development options to the beginning of the configure script,
  to facilitate adjustment of compiler options (especially for Ultrix)
  to reduce the number of spurious warnings from miscombining -g/-O
  options. - TD
* Correct misplaced assignment to cf_cv_ncurses_header in configure.in,
  which caused misconfigure against vendor curses, reported by Hynek Med
  (Ultrix) and Roger Hill (HP-UX 10.x). - TD
1997-09-09
* Added arguments to the multinet_htons() and multinet_ntohs() declarations
  in tcp.h. - FM
* Tweak of the this_MIMEcharset[] and this_LYNXcharset[] checks in
  makeuctb.c. - FM
* Replaced the index() and bcopy() with strchr() and memcpy() in the
  putenv() for NeXT in LYUtils.c. - FM
1997-09-08
* Added a -preparsed flag, to be used with -source or with SOURCE view.
  When invoked with this flag, show HTML text as it is output from the SGML
  parsing stage, regenerated via HTMLGen.c functions, rather than the usual
  more raw rendering (in SOURCE view) or the original byte stream (as with
  the -source flag, possibly with BASE information prepended).  Lynx will
  attempt to wrap the text to screen width (or 80 cols for the -source flag),
  but will not always succeed.  Unrecognized tags and attributes as well as 
  comments are dropped, attributes reordered, missing end tags supplied, 
  abd other changes made, showing how Lynx internally treats the document's
  structure.  This is probably most useful for debugging (of either Lynx's
  parsing or of HTML documents, although a real validator should be used for 
  the latter!).  It can also be instructive to switch the DTD parsing mode
  (with the ^V key) while viewing preparsed source.
  Note that this doesn't work so well now with character translations and 
  entity expansion don't work well now, showing some of the same problems
  which appear for rendered documents and dropping some characters.  Making
  those problems of parsing more directly visible was one of the motivations
  for this flag.  Also note that META tags which may contain charset info
  are never interpreted when using -source (with or without the -preparsed
  flag), but when interactively switching to SOURCE view, Lynx MAY remember
  that charset info from the previous non-SOURCE full parsing (again this
  applies with or without -preparsed); the INFO screen should always show
  the assumption currently in effect. - KW
* Updated some HTMLGenerator functions to use line wrapping logic found in
  newer libwww versions, and further mods in HTMLGen.c. - KW
* Tweaks to use of chartrans stages, should now better preserve charset
  info from META tags even in compressed HTML files. - KW
* Fixed a problem with LYCheckForCSI which could lead to crashes. - KW
1997-09-06
* Modifications to allow the Lynx lynxcgi feature to process
  PATH_INFO in addition to QUERY_STRINGS in URLs.  DOCUMENT_ROOT
  may be set by the user in lynx.cfg and is then passed as well.
  If DOCUMENT_ROOT is set, then PATH_TRANSLATED is calculated and
  passed as well. - J. Kevin Ternes <jkternes@mindspring.com>
* Changes to LYPrint.c to put the variable LYNX_PRINT_TITLE
  into the system()'ed environment for use by post-Lynx, pre-lp
  formatting scripts.  LYNX_PRINT_TITLE is simply generated by
  calling HText_GetTitle(). - JKT
* Corrections to JKT's mods (to avoid memory leaks etc.).  Avoid
  unnecessary stat() calls.  Other fixes in LYCgi.c.  Make
  setting of HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET actually work.  Now URL-unescape
  the path in lynxcgi URLs before doing anything with it.  
  Better logic for when to check for restrictions, the previous checking
  for !reloading could be easily circumvented.  Also check whether
  the full path including a possible PATH_INFO passes the restrictions
  test by exec_ok(), to catch "../" segments.  Don't try to handle
  a non-executable lynxcgi URL as a file URL if there was a PATH_INFO
  part, it gets too confusing.  Strip '#' fragments from the lynxcgi
  path, but leave the interpretation of '#' characters after a '?' as
  before so that they are still regarded as part of the query or search
  string. If PATHINFO is present, unescaped '#' characters in it will
  still be rejected by exec_ok(). - KW
* added a bit of text about running ./configure to INSTALLATION file.
  - David Combs <dkcombs@netcom.com> & KW
* Added a translation table for Vietnamese (VISCII), and associated code
  changes.  See the file viscii_uni.tbl. - KW
1997-09-05
* Mods in LYGetFile.c to retain a fragment on redirection if the redirection
  URL does not include a fragment. - FM
97-09-04
* Correct ifdef'ing for getbkgd function calls. - TD
* Correct ifdef'ing for remaining inline chmod calls. - TD
* Consolidate various logic for opening secure files into utility
  functions, correcting portability problems as well.  - TD
* Add configure option --with-cfg-file to override default location of
  Lynx configuration file (requested by Laura Eaves).  - TD
* Strip -g option from CFLAGS for the non-debug version of Ultrix
  configuration (requested by Hynek Med).  - TD
* Add configure test for HP "color" curses (noting that this cannot
  possibly comply with XPG4 due to naming conventions, we'll expect
  other problems with it). - TD
* Add checks to configure test for COLOR_CURSES to work around bug
  report for HP-UX.  - TD
* Don't cache configure options except where essential (e.g., the
  setting of 'screen').  - TD
* Change some configure options to disable/enable for consistency.  - TD
1997-09-03
* Tweaks in HTML_put_string() and LYUnEscapeEntities() to deal with line-
  breaks within attributes more consistently, and more independently of
  which convention is used (CRLF, CR, or LF). - KW
* Tweaks to prevent a few compiler warnings. - KW
* Tweaks of the iso06_uni.tbl and iso08_uni.tbl files now compiled in.
  Note that a replacement character or string to replace invalid or
  unrecognized characters can be defined by mapping the Unicode value
  U+FFFD, which is done here (for testing, and because these two charsets
  have a lot of undefined code points).  Also some mods in default 7-bit
  table for some Hebrew characters and points. - KW
1997-09-02
* Mods to include "ISO 8859-6 Arabic" and "ISO 8859-8 Hebrew" in the display
  character set options (Note, though, that Lynx presently has no code to
  deal overtly with non-Latin directionalities.). - DK & FM
1997-08-31
* Mod of HTMIME.c to ignore any Content-Encoding header with a value of
  "identity" (case insensitive).  Shouldn't happen, but better safe than
  sorry. - FM
1997-08-28
* Correct a quoting error in CF_RECHECK_FUNC macro. - TD
1997-08-27
* Further refine/correct configure macros for finding network and curses
  libraries, adding CF_RECHECK_FUNC to simplify CF_NETLIBS. - TD
* Rename #define for NCURSESHEADER to HAVE_NCURSES_H, for consistency. - TD
* Add-back test for -lm to support slang shared libraries. - TD
* Modify test for disentangling ncurses library from mytinfo on FreeBSD
  to workaround linker limitation. - AC
1997-08-22
* Fixed typo in LYReadCFG.c when checking for a NOVICE mode default. - JN
  (Note that this and other lynx.cfg defaults which have 'o'ptions settings
  are overridden when the 'o'ptions are saved to the RC file. - FM)
1997-08-21
* Tweak to LYHistory.c to better remember last position on page. - KW
* Eliminated two more MIME types (application/html and text/x-sgml) from
  the Accept header generated by default by setting the q-value to 2.0,
  since there are more standard alternatives for these names. - KW
* Lower maximum length for generated Accept header lines from 1000 to 252,
  to accommodate an incompetent Windows HTTP server. - KW
* Changed order of some functions in LYCharUtils.c (no other change there
  yet). - KW
1997-08-20
* Modify top-level install rule to depend on 'all'. - TD
* Suppress check for ANSI compiler when we are using gcc. - TD
* Use -g3 option in place of -O -g for Ultrix compiler --debug configuration
  (request by Hynek Med). - TD
* Drop "-lm" library from slang configuration, since it does not seem to
  be used. - TD
* Add configure --includedir and --oldincludedir values to header search
  path for ncurses and slang. - TD
* Modify configure checks for ncurses and slang libraries to generate
  -L options as required, using new macros CF_FIND_LIBRARY and
  CF_LIBRARY_PATH. - TD
* Add substitution for CPP in src/makefile.in so that .c.i rule works. - TD
* Add configure test for lint program. - TD
* Add "make depend" target to generated makefiles.  This is intended only
  for use in editing/developing, since many of the header dependencies in
  chrtrans are generated during the build process and cannot be determined
  by makedepend in advance. - TD
* Add configure option --with-zlib. - TD
1997-08-19
* Tweak of highlight() in LYUtils.c to ensure that split link names with a
  soft hyphen are handled identically for slang, VMS curses and Unix curses
  when such links are made current. - FM
1997-08-17
* Use 0.01 rather than 0.001 as the q value for the global wildcard in
  Accept headers. - FM
* Put up correct makefile for dos port (oops) - WB
1997-08-16
* Mini tweaks for the win-dos ports.  One fix for the pull down boxes
  and the rest mostly maintenance. - WB
* Fixed a bug in LYNews.c which caused overwriting of the first three
  characters in the Subject for a followup. - FM
1997-08-15
* Hack in highlight() to preserve a '-' character at the end of line
  within anchor text, which can result from splitting at the position
  of a &shy; or <SHY> or SOFT HYPHEN character. - KW
* Tweaks in print_wwwfile_to_fd print_crawl_to_fd to output a soft hyphen
  character if it is present at the end of a line.  For -dump, a raw
  ISO 8859 SOFT HYPHEN character may be written if the Display Character
  Set (default from lynx.cfg or saved value in .lynxrc) is an ISO 8859
  character set, but this may be overridden with the -raw toggle.
  Otherwise represent soft hyphen with '-' as usual. - KW
* Modified the news gateway to try XGTITLE for wildcarded lists of
  available newsgroups (e.g., news:bionet.* for the bionet hierarchy,
  or news:* for all of its served newsgroups).  If that fails, Lynx
  retries with the old behavior of using LIST NEWSGROUPS and parsing
  the reply itself for the desired groups.  Note that LIST NEWSGROUPS
  can take a wildcarded argument for some nntp servers, but not all,
  so we don't risk it. - FM
* Fixed a bug in HTHandleAuthInfo() of yesterday's HTNews.c which could
  yield an infinite while() loop. - FM
* Various tweaks in HTNews.c to HTHandleAuthInfo() and elsewhere, to
  keep connections open more often in some common cases of non-fatal
  errors, and also avoid trying to use the network socket after some
  recognized case of closing by the server.  Only based on some testing
  with INN's nnrpd, not on any written specs. - KW
1997-08-14
* Added nntp authorization (AUTHINFO) handling to the news gateway. - FM
* Added a "Loading cfg file '%s'." trace message in LYMain.c to indicate
  the absolute path of the configuration (lynx.cfg) file which was used
  at startup (if Lynx is invoked with the -trace command line switch). - FM
* Added code in HTFWriter.c to avoid calling HTLoadFile() on the temporary
  file which results from decompression of a temporary file created by
  HTCompressed(), if this would just result in making a copy of the file
  and then invoking an external viewer.  Instead the viewer command is
  now invoked directly from the HTFWriter_free of the HTCompressed()
  stream after decompression. - KW
* Added code in HTFWriter.c, HTFile.c, and HTFormat.c to support reading
  of gzipped local files directly, using functions from the zlib library.
  Note that gzipped files from remote servers are still first copied to
  a temporary file before lynx can process them further, and an external
  GZIP_PATH command is still needed at least for passing such files to an
  external viewer, as well as for various DIRED_SUPPORT File menu functions.
  To activate this code, the symbol USE_ZLIB has to be defined, it is
  currently not set by the auto-config script.  The zlib library may be
  already installed on your system (probably called libz.a or libz.so.1
  or similar, the required header files are zlib.h and zconf.h), otherwise
  it is available through <http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/>, it
  appears to support all platforms for which lynx is available (including
  VMS, DOS, MS Win32).  Note that this library would probably also be
  needed if in the future support for the HTTP/1.1 "deflate" content-coding
  is added. - KW
* Don't send MIME types in Accept headers whose q values are outside of the
  allowed range 0.0 <= q <= 1.0 - KW
* Tweaks in HTInit.c to use the official names for image/png and image/tiff,
  but still support the image/x-* forms. - KW
1997-08-13
* Tweaks of LYConvertToURL() in LYUtils.c and HTParseInet() in HTTCP.c
  to deal more coherently with 'z'ap attempts during gethostbyname()
  calls. - FM
* Tweaks of split_line() and HText_endAppend() in GridText.c to handle
  trimming of spaces from the tails of link names more effectively. - FM
* Expanded the OL nesting depth and type counters to track up to 12 list
  depths before punting to the lowest negative number.  Note that the
  indentations still are limited to 6 nested depths, so use the TYPE
  attribute to distinguish OLs with deeper nestings. - FM
1997-08-12
* Mods of LYMainLoop.c to maintain treatment of a local startfile as
  text/html source when it does not have a suffix mapped to that MIME
  type and the -force_html switch was used. - FM
* Added .phtml to the default suffix mappings for text/html. - FM
* Mods of LYCurses.c to avoid using /dev/tty arbitrarily for stdin on
  Unix when compiling with slang versions greater than 0.99-35, based
  on JED's suggestion to lynx-dev. - FM
* Tweaks of HTCheckFnameForCompression() in GridText.c to avoid warnings
  from some compilers. - FM
1997-08-09
* Changed the code of 1997-08-06 which modifies suggested filenames for a
  'D'ownload to be more cautious: don't remove a '.gz', '.Z' etc. suffix
  if there is no header indication that we have a compressed file.  Not
  all servers and gateways (including the internal FTP gateway) detect
  and label compressed content reliably. - KW
1997-08-08
* Mods of HTTP.c so that download requests are converted to presentation
  requests for interactive users, and traversal requests are converted to
  cancels, when servers return non-success statuses with bodies which
  should be displayed to interactive users. - FM
* Added the "DosCyrillic (cp866)" display character set to the chartrans
  support, and tweaked the other Cyrillic charset tables. - AAC & KW
* Tweaked MULTI_SUFFIX support in HTFile.c, so that it now somewhat
  works.  Dunno whether it's useful for anybody. - KW
1997-08-07
* Tweaks of yesterdays mods in GridText.c. - FM
* Correct storage class of variables in UCMap.h, from -warn-common linker
  option. - TD
* Refine configure tests for acs_map, ttytype to accommodate broken linker
  on FreeBSD 2.1.5 - TD
* Modify README.configure to indicate the associated definitions for
  each configure option, as suggested by Klaus Weide. - TD
* Correct duplicate declaration of Current_Attr, which Linux linker ignores
  (reported by Hynek Med). - TD
* Add -G7 option to Ultrix compiler options (request by Hynek Med
  <xmedh02@lada.vse.cz>). - TD
* Add include for <sys/types.h> to utmp configure test (reported by Andrey
  A. Chernov). - TD
* Add check for FreeBSD library mytinfo (reported by Andrey A. Chernov
  <ache@null.net>). - TD
* Modify ./makefile.in so that 'all', the default target, will build the
  Lynx executable. The old 'all' target is retained as "make help". - TD
* Modify src/makefile.in to allow development compiles within the src
  directory. - TD
* Mask spaces in the bkgd (background attribute) calls for color curses to
  make the color-style code work better with SVr4 curses. - TD
* Change workaround for 8-bit acs characters by adding to the initialization
  a loop forcing the entries of acs_map[] to 8-bits. - TD
* Many minor tweaks for the DJGPP version by DK - WB
* A rename of about_lynx_dev.html to lynx_dev.html for 8.3 systems - WB
1997-08-06
* Modified HTMIME.c and LYCharUtils.c so that setting of suggested filenames
  via a filename=value pair in Content-Disposition headers and META elements
  is not restricted to the file disposition type. - FM
* Mods in GridText.c, LYGetFile.c and HTAnchor.c so that suggested filenames
  will have appropriate suffixes when 'd'ownloading, based on whether or not
  the file is gzipped or Unix compressed. - FM
1997-08-05
* Mods of the lead relative symbolic element stripping for http/https
  URLs in cases for which they would persist when resolved to an
  absolute URL.  The latest URL draft is ambiguous about whether this
  should be considered an error, and leaves the handling of it up to the
  UA.  So we now get rid of all lead relative symbolic elements from the
  resolved http/https URLs, but no others, and still issue a Bad Partial
  Reference statusline message. - FM
* Tweaks of title handling in LYMainLoop.c and LYShowInfo.c so that the
  known title, or link name associated with ACTIVATE-ion, form submission,
  or a HEAD request, will be used in the INFO ('=') display. - FM & KW
1997-08-04
* Fixed header parsing in HTMIME.c so that "Safe:" is recognized. - KW
* Changed confirmation prompts for HEAD (']') commands acting on a POST
  document, to reflect the fact that the POST request body will not
  actually be submitted in a HEAD request. - KW
* Reset LYCancelDownload to FALSE at top of getfile(), to prevent delayed
  effect which can otherwise occur. - KW
* Block URLs with port numbers outside the range of valid numbers in
  getfile(). - KW
1997-08-03
* Changed the NSL_FORK code in HTTCP.c so that the gethostbyname() call
  is retried without forking if the child process exits without returning
  enough data.  Also added trace output, to show whether something
  unusual has happened to the child process. - KW
* The IETF has indicated intent to adopt KW's "status 307" proposal for
  dealing with the status 302 problems, so HTTP.c and HTAlert.c implement
  that now.  The 302 status is "General (temporary) Redirection" which
  can be handled as 303 at the UA's discretion, so we do that in all cases,
  rather than prompting the user whether to do that when the 302 is for
  a POST submission.  The 307 (and 305) for POST submissions invokes a
  prompt whether to P)roceed or C)ancel, without the Use G)ET option.
  The 301 is treated as permanent, normally, but for POST submissions
  still is treated as temporary and invokes a prompt which includes the
  Use G)ET option, because scripts written to empirical behavior may
  still be expecting that (it's virtually never encountered in redirections
  of POSTs, though, because the document containing the form typically
  is redirected, so the user only sees the form if a local copy has been
  made, and it would be best to C)ancel and get a new local copy of the
  document from the correct http/https URL, to serve as a BASE for the
  form's ACTION). - FM
* Changed the typedef for HTCoord in HTStyle.h from float to int, for
  significant speedup of rendering on machines without floating-point
  hardware based on DW's, KW's, BL's analyses.  Note that this should 
  be taken into account when/if external style sheet support is added
  for page formatting (e.g., for optimum handling by speech synthesizers
  and braille interfaces), beyond the current emphasis on colorizing. - FM
1997-08-02
* The cookie pre-draft has been adopted as an IETF ID:
  ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-03.txt
  so the code for combining Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers has been
  eliminated in LYCookie.c (see mods for 1997-07-31). - FM
1997-08-01
* Fixed typos in LYCookie.c. - FM
1997-07-31
* Mods of the cookie handling based on the latest pre-draft.  Add a
  Cookie2: $Version="1" header in any requests that use historical
  cookies in the Cookie: request header, so that modern servers will
  use Set-Cookie2 headers with modern cookies in their subsequent
  replies.  Limit the scheme for commentURLs to http or https, not
  just to network servers (e.g., gopher is now barred too).  Include
  a $Port attribute in modern Cookie request headers if it was set
  via a server's reply header.  The pre-draft indicates intention
  to drop the requirement to combine Set-Cookie2 and Set-Cookie
  headers if both types were received.  We're still combining them,
  but based on bona fide one-to-one correspondence checks (which were
  not specified in the earlier draft), so that's OK, and we'll get
  rid of that needless overhead if the current pre-draft holds up
  and becomes an official IETF draft. - FM
* Added a -nocc command line switch for disabling the Cc: prompt
  for self copies of mailings.  Note that this does not disable
  any CCs that have been incorporated within a mailto URL or form
  ACTION. - FM
* Added a NO_FORCED_CORE_DUMP compilation (userdefs.h) and configuration
  (lynx.cfg) symbol, normally set FALSE, which if changed to TRUE will
  block forced core dumps on Unix via abort() calls on fatal errors or
  assert() calls on potentially fatal error checks.  Also added a -core
  command line switch for toggling the default. - FM
* Updated the documentation and 'h'elp concerning the new symbol and
  switches. - FM
1997-07-30
* Added workaround for curses with broken handling of 8-bit acs characters
  (which may be used for drawing of popup boxes) to LYCurses.h.  This fixes
  box characters and attributes/colors for solaris curses used with linux
  console as terminal.  Currently it is not automatically enabled or
  configured, but can be enabled by -DBROKEN_CURSES_8BIT_ACS. - KW
* Mod in HTFWriter.c to change the statusline appropriately when an
  uncompression has completed. - FM
* Fixed code in LYOptions.c for the case when NEVER_ALLOW_REMOTE_EXEC was
  not defined and ALLOW_USERS_TO_CHANGE_EXEC_WITHIN_OPTIONS was defined. - KW
1997-07-28
* Avoid traversing the full list of anchors each time when HText_endAnchor()
  is called with a non-zero anchor number, if that number corresponds to
  the last anchor added to the HText structure. It is is the most common case
  that HText_endAnchor() refers to the last anchor, and the only case that
  could be handled correctly before FM's changes of 1997-05-13.  Avoiding
  the loop over the list of anchor can improve loading time significantly,
  especially for large files with thousands of anchors. - KW
* Add progress display and 'z'appability for loading of local files.
  They are activated only after a few hundred k bytes have been read.
  Added define for HT_PARTIAL_CONTENT to HTUtils.h, used in above.
  (The WWW Library 5.x uses HTTP-ish status codes like this throughout.
  I find it much less confusing than -29998 and so on, and there's no
  conflict in this case. - KW
* Minor LYUtils.c tweaks. - KW
1997-07-27
* Changed code for checks in LYGetFile.c for URL schemes which should 
  be rejected when received as redirections, added checks for more 
  schemes. - FM
* Rename top-level Makefile to Makefile.old (it's obsolete) - TD
* Reduce top-level targets to one, 'lynx' - TD
* Move comments describing DirEd to README.configure from makefile.in,
  leaving only the definitions that haven't been integrated yet. - TD
* Add configure options to enable/disable DirEd and its associated modes. - TD
* Add configure option to enable/disable char-trans support. - TD
* Correct sense of autoconf'd symbol for size-change. - TD
* Accommodate systems with obsolete ncurses.h in configure tests. - TD
1997-07-26
* Changed the variable hline in LYUtils.c to hLine, so as not to conflict
  with a curses function or macro. - FM
* Fixed an esoteric glitch in highlight() of LYUtils.c which could cause
  the last character of a current link to receive WHEREIS search target
  emphasis if it happened to be the first character of the target (though
  perfection is unattainable, we should strive to achieve it :). - FM
* Changed the default value for STRIP_DOTDOT_URLS (lynx.cfg) to TRUE. - KW
* Made some of the additional checks introduced yesterday in LYMainLoop.c
  for invalid links to internal dired URLs more strict, as they probably
  were intended. - KW
* Added checks for some internal URL types, which should be rejected
  if received in a server redirection, to LYGetFile.c.  Maybe more types
  should be added to the list. - KW
1997-07-25
* Map charsets of the form "ibmNNN<...>" to "cpNNN<...>" in UCdomap.c
  if not already recognized.  Also recognize "windows-1252". - KW
* Compared the handling of 4-way "show color (&)" in the 'o'ptions menu
  against FM's implementation, and made some changes (mostly in formatting, 
  variable and constant names and usage, ordering of statements) to aid
  further comparison.  The logic is still messy and needs further cleanup
  and simplification, but seems to do what it should.  Note that this
  also handles color-curses, in a (hopefully) reasonable way.  Command
  line flags -nocolor and (if using slang) -color override a preference
  found in the RC file. See updated "Lynx Users Guide" file and the 
  comments written to the RC file.
  Documentation changes adapted from FM's changes. - KW
* Mods of the DIRED_SUPPORT to check the actual URLs of temporary files
  rather than just their titles when filtering for spoofing attempts via
  external files with internal URLs.  Also recast the PRIVATE my_spawn()
  to a PUBLIC LYExecv(), so that it can be used by any module (though
  presently it's still used only by LYLocal.c functions). - FM
* Tweaks of LYCharUtils.c to handle Set-Cookie HTTP-EQUIVs in META elements
  without risking crashes in LYCookie.c or HTParse.c. - FM
1997-07-24
* Made "show color" option a 4-way choice, if compiled with color support
  and if saving of options to a .lynxrc file is allowed. - KW
* Made changing file permissions with DIRED_SUPPORT work again; one of
  the recently added checks in LYMainLoop.c was too restrictive.
  Added protection to permit_location in LYLocal.c, similar to the changes
  of 1997-06-24 to LYDownload.c. - KW
* Generate CANCELLED message when editing of a string value on the Options
  Screen has been cancelled (typically with ^G), instead of an 
  inappropriate VALUE_ACCEPTED statusline. - KW
1997-07-23
* Tweaks of the strtok() calls for textarea values in HTML.c, so that they
  will never be repeated after NULL has been returned, and thus won't cause
  linux-alpha to crash. - FM
* Make -nocolor command line flag work if compiled with slang.  Note that
  -nocolor is strong, it overrides all other reasons that might otherwise
  turn color on. - KW
* Tweaks in LYCurses.c to ensure that slang library and Lynx flags for
  whether color support is on stay in register. - FM
* Change the default in userdefs.h for SHOW_COLOR to FALSE for USE_SLANG.
  Because of the different logic used for LYShowColor in the curses code
  vs. slang code, setting SHOW_COLOR to TRUE makes it difficult to invoke
  a binary compiled with slang so that color is not used on startup
  (except by using -nocolor).
  Note that reading show_color from .lynxrc is still commented out. - KW
* There is now a "trailing comment" handler in LYReadCFG.c. It treats '#'
  as a comment token only if it is somewhere after the last colon for the
  lynx.cfg entry and is preceded by a space or tab. - FM
* Added TT to the Utterly Tag and Attribute Soup group of HTML elements. - FM
  (applies only to "old" DTD in this code set, as usual - KW)
1997-07-22
* Modify curses popups in LYForms.c and LYOptions.c to use background color
  from main window - TD
* Ifdef'd out the logic that saves "show color" to .lynxrc, since it is
  deemed to be confusing to users - TD
* Merged FM's changes to the "show color (&)" toggle to save to .lynxrc,
  support slang, update online documentation - TD
* Add error message to show actual context in error-checking for color
  parsing suggested by Filip M Gieszczykiewicz - TD
* Check for/suppress duplicate -lsocket in network library configure - TD
* Remove HP-UX snake2/snake3 targets from makefile.in - TD
* Add configure script case for 'sequent', drop ptx, ptx2 targets from
  makefile.in - TD
* Add logic to configure script handling of slang to suppress spurious
  -Ipredefined when header location is given in $CFLAGS - TD
1997-07-21
* Check for lynx_uses_color and LYShowColor in lynx_start_status_color()
  and lynx_stop_status_color() of LYCurses.c so that the statusline
  will appear reverse (or otherwise highlighted if the terminal doesn't
  support reverse), if color support is compiled in but not currently
  used. - KW
* Added comments on color usage to lynx.cfg. - KW
1997-07-20
* Added command-line option "-nocolor" to disable color on terminals that
  would otherwise support it.  Added options toggle for colors, tested
  with ncurses. - TD
* Remove option value from configure option "--with-color-styles". - TD
* Correct background of popups in LYOptions.c - TD
* Add configure check for compiler options to enable prototypes - TD
* Remove IRIX "-cckr" compiler flags. - TD
* Correct whitespace as per LPS: LYCurses.c, LYOptions.c - TD
* Tweaks of LYMainLoop.c in the code controlling how the document is reloaded
  due to any changes in the 'o'ption menu which require a new rendering of
  the document (but still without forcing a proxy cache refresh when that is
  inappropriate; see the 1997-05-26 mods). - FM
1997-07-18
* Mods in LYexit.c and LYCurses.c to ensure restoration of stderr (if it
  was changed for output to the trace log) on all exits. - BRL & FM
* Include an unsigned char typecast in the HASH_FUNCTION definition for
  HTAtom.c - CK
* Modified change to is_url() of 1997-07-13 to check for the slash after
  stripping any lead space characters. - FM
1997-07-16
* Added the Windows Cyrillic display character set. - AAC
  (Andrey A. Chernov <ache@null.net>)
1997-07-15
* Added support for a commentURL attribute in cookies.  This attribute is
  under discussion in the HTTP-WG and not presently in the draft (see the
  1997-07-09 mods for the draft's URL), but would be extremely advantageous
  for multi-lingual and non-English-speaking sites because the comment
  attribute can have only ASCII characters in its value, whereas a request
  for the comment via a URL in turn allows use of charset and language
  negotiation for what the server returns.  The value of the commentURL is
  resolved and retained only if it's scheme points to a server (i.e., file
  and special lynx URLs are rejected), and if it is retained, is included
  as a link in the Cookie Jar Page.  If commentURL is not ultimately
  included in the revised State Management RFC, sites which wish to use
  it could do a User-Agent check for Lynx (and any other browsers which
  implement it). - FM
* Fixed a typo in HTCompressed() of HTFWriter.c so that the last dot in a
  tentative temporary filename is sought via strrchr(), as is done for
  HTSaveAndExecute() and HTSaveToFile(). - KW
1997-07-14
* Yet more tweaks of the cookie support.  We include $PATH and/or $DOMAIN
  attribute/value pairs in Cookie request headers only when their values
  were set explicitly via a server's Set-Cookie and/or Set-Cookie2 reply
  headers (and the cookies are $VERSION="1" or greater). - FM
* Added support for IFRAME homologous (but not identical) to that for FRAME.
  It is handled as a block with a blank line before and after style, and
  with margins and default alignment inherited from the containing block,
  division, or span.  The IFRAME rendition always begins with an emphasized
  "IFRAME: " label followed by the NAME attribute's value, if present, or
  the URL for the SRC attribute, serving as a link for the SRC, followed
  on a new line by any rendered IFRAME content. - FM
* Added handling of LEGEND elements.  The content is rendered in place,
  as for CAPTION elements, since we don't have multiple pass inlining
  capabilities.  Hopefully, if the LEGEND is intended to be ALIGN-ed at
  the "top" or "bottom" of the associated insert, the author will place
  the LEGEND element above or below it, respectively.  Note that LABEL
  elements similarly are rendered in place, and will be displayed
  interpretably only if the INPUT to which the LABEL's "for" attribute
  refers, immediately follows the LABEL element. - FM
* Added recognition of BUTTON elements, and handling of them (sorta :)
  when they are TYPE="submit" or TYPE="reset" in forms.  The default
  "submit" or "reset" string, or the value of a VALUE attribute, if
  present, is embedded in parentheses and used for the link, and the
  content is simply rendered and displayed in place.  Until we see what
  kind of markup the real world puts in such elements, it's too risky
  to try to use that rendition as the link.  Also, the W3C's HTML 4.0
  draft presently is very fuzzy about whether, and if so, when, an IMG
  element in the BUTTON content should be treated as an image map, so
  the present code doesn't try to cast any submitted BUTTON name/value
  pairs into the format for INPUTs with TYPE="image".  When the BUTTON
  is a script control rather than submit or reset button, a "[BUTTON]"
  pseudo-ALT is inserted to warn users of its presence, but the form
  is not disabled.  The W3C's HTML 4.0 draft makes scripting intrinsic,
  with no SGML-based fallbacks if it is not available or is disabled by
  security-conscious sites.  Dave Raggett of the W3C replied to criticisms
  of this in www-html@w3c.org by saying that he wished it have been
  otherwise, but "market forces" prevailed (Sigh...) - FM
1997-07-13
* Changed is_url() to return immediately if the string to check starts with 
  a slash character.  This prevents some false positives if the string
  contains ':' characters. - KW
* Added support for "MACOS AppleShare IP FTP Server" to HTFTP.c.
  Only based on and tested with (the current incarnation of)
  <ftp://www.unicode.org/>. - KW
1997-07-12
* Correct some build issues with the merge (ifdefs for the curses modules)
  as well as minor fix for makefile distclean rule. - TD
* More refinements of the cookie support in relation to recent discussions
  in the HTTP-WG, and for more fully effective protection against denial
  of service attacks.  If the same attribute appears more than once for
  the same cookie, ensure that the first instance will be used.  Limit
  the total number of cookies across Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers
  to 50 per server reply, and each cookie to a maximum of 4096 bytes. - FM
1997-07-11
* Added support for hexadecimal character references (&#xH;) as proposed
  in the W3C HTML 4.0 draft. - FM
1997-07-10
* Synchronized the development code against the fotemods patches up to
  1997-07-06 (relevant changes listed below, as usual).  Note that FM
  has now included the chartrans code, but has eliminated conditional 
  compilation of it; however, in this code set setting -DEXP_CHARTRANS 
  at compile time is still necessary (but compilation without it has not 
  been tested). - KW
* Fixed character counting logic in display_line() for lines where 
  soft hyphens (&shy; or <SHY> or a soft-hyphen character) are used
  for their intended purpose. - KW
  NOTE: The W3C HTML 4.0 draft explicitly specifies handling of &shy;,
  &#173; (and now also &#xAD;) in the manner long implemented by Lynx
  (i.e., as a truly soft hyphen), and not in the brain-dead manner
  implemented by Netscape and MSIE. - FM
* Various tweaks of the cookie support to handle likely (based on past
  experience in the real world :) abuses of Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2
  headers from servers.  Most importantly, apply sanity checks to the
  values of port attributes so that any unquoted port list will not be
  misinterpreted as the start of a new cookie within the port list.
  Also added code to fold (CR LF TAB) Cookie request headers if they
  contain a long sequence of cookies which would exceed 1024 bytes on
  one line, since some servers suffer buffer overruns and crash in such
  cases. - FM
* Modified HTNews.c to use HTmmdecode() and HTrjis() for the Subject and
  Author strings in listings of news articles when using a Japanese display
  character set. - HN
1997-07-09
* Massive updating and revamping of the cookie support in accordance with
  http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-02.txt
  which is scheduled to replace RFC 2109 on July 15, 1997.  Noteworthy
  changes are that (1) the blanket port restriction is now lifted, and
  sharing of cookies among servers with matching domains but different
  ports is blocked only if a port attribute was included in the
  Set-Cookie2 header (or Set-Cookie header, though it's not expected
  there), with a value which defaults to the request's port, but can
  be a comma separated list of ports, and (2) the blanket restriction
  on sharing of SSL-encrypted (https) cookies with http servers is
  lifted, and normally depends on the Set-Cookie or Set-Cookie2 header
  having included a secure attribute.  However, a configuration option
  (see lynx.cfg) to FORCE_SSL_COOKIES_SECURE is now available, and the
  compilation or configuration default can be toggled via a -force_secure
  command line switch. - FM
* Make NOCACHE ('x' key) work as expected from history list for internal 
  links. - KW
* Removed bogus checking for a config file in home directory which had
  been introduced into the development code. - KW

* Synchronized the development code against the fotemods patches up to
  1997-06-24 - TD & KW
1997-07-06
* Implemented popup windows for the 'o'ptions menu, homologous to those
  for SELECT blocks in forms.  They are implemented when select_popups
  is on, and include WHEREIS search and 123[g,p] features (very useful
  for navigating the choice list of 28 display character sets :).  Use
  the F_LINK_NUM command ('0') to invoke the prompt for a choice list
  number when in NUMBERS_AS_ARROWS mode.  The popups are not invoked for
  the simple, binary choice options.  Also modified the options menu so
  that the cursor is positioned to the left of choices when show_curser
  is on (but it is still positioned initially at the endings of strings
  when the line editor is invoked for options that have user-entered
  values). - FM
1997-07-04 (KaBoom! :)
* Mods of HTMIME.c and HTFile.c to ignore Content-Type parameters other
  than charset when charset is not present, as we do when it is present
  and we know we can handle it. - FM
* Fixed bug in LYNews.c which could cause Lynx to crash when posting or
  sending followups to news groups and the Organization header was
  obtained from the /etc/organization file. - FM
* Fixed bug in LYEdit.c which could cause Lynx to crash when an editor
  to which a line number is passed as an argument is used and there are
  no links on the current page of the document to be edited. - FM
* Added information about the new $USER feature to the comments about
  TEMP_SPACE in userdefs.h. - FM
1997-07-03
* Tweaks of change_sug_filename() in LYUtils.c to make protections against
  buffer overruns explicit within the function. - FM
* Tweaks of the #ifdef'ing in HTTCP.c. - FM
1997-07-02
* Mods in LYDownload.c and LYPrint.c to treat a suggested output file
  entry of "/dev/null" on Unix, and "nl:" or "/nl/" paths on VMS (case
  insensitive), as a cancel (^G). - FM
* Mods in LYGetFile.c to include URLs with content from a form submission
  with method GET in the group for which Referer headers are never sent,
  because the content might include private (e.g., password or credit
  card) information which should not be visible in Referer logs. - FM
* Added -G 7 to the LYFLAGS and MCFLAGS for the ultrix and ultrix-slang
  Makefile targets when using the native ultrix compiler. - HM
* Added -DNSL_FORK to the LYFLAGS for all of the solaris2 and Linux
  targets in Makefile. - FM
* The above two changes don't affect the makefile used by auto-config - KW
1997-06-30
* Removed a redundant declaration in UCdomap.c which was causing some
  compilers to balk. - FM
* Fixed typos in SGML.c which could cause echoing of numeric character
  references for some of the display character sets. - FM
1997-06-29
* Updated lynx.hlp, lynx.man and the online 'h'elp concerning the chartrans
  support. - FM
1997-06-26
* Tweak of the "tag and attribute soup" parsing mods in HTML.c so that the
  PLAIN attribute works for UL blocks again. - FM
* More tweaks of LYMainLoop.c to issue informative statusline messages
  about attempts to ACTIVATE, DOWNLOAD, or submit URLs or ACTIONs which
  are disallowed in the current context and destined to fail, rather than
  acting on them and generating actual failures. - FM
* Mods of LYmktime() in LYUtils.c to support dd-mm-yyyy format for expires
  headers and cookie attributes. - FM
* Oops, hadn't included checks for whether there are links on the page
  in this morning's LYMainLoop.c mods to ensure appropriate statusline
  messages for attempts to bookmark special URLs that can't be bookmarked,
  which could yield a crash it there aren't any.  The checks are in there
  now. - FM
* Added ability to bookmark links from the Lynx List Page, as from the
  Visited Links Page, but not for those pages, themselves, since they
  are temporary files.  Note that Lynx List Page links will not have
  the documents' titles, as do those in the Visited Links Page, unless
  you've visited them before invoking the Lynx List Page. - FM
* Added explicit protections against buffer overruns in the LYDownload.c
  handling of suggested filenames. - FM
* Changes in LYCurses.c, GridText.c, HTML.c, and LYUtils.c, and smaller
  changes to some other files, to fix problems with RP's style code.
  Color leaking should now be at least much reduced, and some possible
  crashes avoided. - KW
1997-06-24
* Mods in LYDownload.c to check whether the File= field in a LYNXDOWNLOAD
  URL has the value that was inserted into the URL via the most recent
  download options menu.  This prevents spoofing with arbitrary LYNXDOWNLOAD
  URLs entered via the 'g'oto or ECGOTO commands, or ACTIVATE-ed in a file
  other than the most recent download options menu which was created by
  Lynx internally. - FM
* Mods in LYMainLoop.c to ignore LYNXCOOKIE, LYNXDIRED, LYNXDOWNLOAD, and
  LYNXPRINT URLs if entered via a 'g'oto or ECGOTO command, and to issue
  a statusline message explaining that the special URL is not allowed as a
  goto.  This is just for informational purposes, and the above anti-spoof
  mod is not dependent on it. - FM
1997-06-23
* remove "Styles" identifier from Lynx version string in userdefs.h
  since it causes "patch-o-matic" to choke. -- JES
1997-06-20
* Now that we add or subtract attributes for Unix FANCY_CURSES, as for VMS
  curses and slang, the 1997-05-30 mods based on LE's patch for keeping track
  of whether links occur in an underlining context, and if so, restoring it
  when a current link is made non-current, should be extended to FANCY_CURSES
  as well.  So they are extended, now, in highlight() of LYUtils.c. - FM
* Added code in LYNewsPost() of LYNews.c for converting any EUC or SJIS to
  JIS (ISO-2022-JP) in posts or followups to Usenet news groups if the
  display character set is "Japanese (EUC)" or "Japanese (SJIS)".  The mods
  need testing by Japanese users, because the TO_JIS() function I added
  long ago in SGML.c has not actually been used before. - FM
* Modified the hack in LYPrint.c for mailing HTML source so that it never
  appends a charset parameter to the "text/html" value of the Content-Type
  header if compiled without chartrans enabled. - FM & KW
1997-06-18
* Added a check for nonsense LINES and COLS values in setup() of LYCurses.c,
  homologous to the check in size_change() of LYUtils.c, and set LYlines and
  LYcols to the 80x24 default if they're nonsense.  The slang library and
  most curses implementations do the equivalent themselves, but we may as
  well make sure it's done. - FM
* Tweaks of the anti-spoof mods in HTFWriter.c for additional protection
  against extra %s entries in viewer command mappings. - FM
1997-06-17
* Came up with a low overhead way to restore the emphasis for WHEREIS
  search targets when links are made current or non-current and the
  target string starts before and/or extends past the end of the link
  name (hightext or hightext2) string (see 1997-06-14 mods), so the
  restoration works in that case as well, now. - FM
1997-06-14
* Fixed a longstanding bug in highlight() of LYUtils.c which caused seeking
  of a column position less than 0 and strange behavior when a link is made
  current, if show_cursor is on and the link begins at column 0 (as can
  happen in PRE blocks).  We now position the cursor on the first character
  of such links, so the current link will remain clear for those with speech
  or braille interfaces. - FM
* Added functions in LYCurses.c, along the lines of those in the development
  code, so that the [w]start_foo() and [w]stop_foo() functions no longer
  just replace character attributes for Unix FANCY_CURSES, but now add or
  subtract them as for VMS curses and slang. - FM
* More mods in GridText.c and LYUtils.c so that the handling of WHEREIS
  search target emphasis when links are made current and non-current is the
  full equivalent for Unix FANCY_CURSES of that for VMS curses and slang.
  Note that the restoration of search target emphasis does not succeed if
  the hit started before or extends beyond the link name (hightext or
  hightext2 string).  What it would take to succeed in that case as well
  doesn't seem worth the overhead, but I'm still thinking about it.  Also
  note that we still do not emphasize search target hits, but only do link
  or page re-positioning, for Unix curses when only standout() and standin()
  are supported.  In that case, standout() is being used for all links,
  including the current (with the latter indicated via cursor position by
  turning show_cursor on), so we don't want to create a totally confusing
  situation by using standout() for search target hits as well.  The code
  is still designed to degrade gracefully when the terminal does not have
  the capabilities of the curses or slang with which Lynx was built. - FM
1997-06-13
* Tweak of yesterday's LYGetFile.c mods.  Lost a lynx_edit_mode = FALSE
  statement that is still needed when DIRED_SUPPORT is defined. - FM
* Mods in LYForms.c so that the cursor is positioned at the left of the
  current option in select popup windows when show_cursor is on, as when
  the cursor is used to indicate the current link in the main document.
  This is important when Lynx is used with a speech or braille interface,
  or a terminal which does not respond to the highlighting/color for the
  current option.  When show_cursor is off, the cursor is still positioned
  to the right of the current option for curses, and is fully "hidden" in
  the lower right corner for slang, so that the highlighting or color of
  the current option can be used without the distraction of a blinking
  cursor in the left-to-right reading field. - FM
* Added ability to change the show_cursor setting via the 'o'ptions menu
  and to save that as the default in the RC file (otherwise, the default
  is still that set in userdefs.h or lynx.cfg).  The -show_cursor command
  line switch toggles the default, however obtained, homologously to the
  -popup toggle.  Updated the online 'h'elp accordingly (option_help.html
  and Lynx_users_guide.html). - FM
1997-06-12
* Tweaks of the 1997-06-04 mods for restoring emphasis of WHEREIS search
  targets in link names when they are changed to the current link or again
  made non-current.  When the link is made current, the first and last
  characters of the link name never are emphasized, so they'll retain the
  attributes/color for the current link, and the user can see (if sighted)
  that the link was made current.  With this change, the restoration of
  emphasis also is interpretable with Unix FANCY_CURSES, so the block for
  that is lifted.  Note that I figured out why the bold+reverse+underline
  combination doesn't work for that.  The vanilla and this Lynx code are
  not adding or subtracting attributes for their start_foo() and stop_foo()
  functions (as is done for slang and VMS curses), but are replacing them,
  so you always end up with the last attribute in a series of start_foo()
  calls (underlining for the search target emphasis).  I don't know if
  ability to sum attributes applies to all Unix curses flavors for which
  FANCY_CURSES is defined in the Makefile, so I left the Unix, non-slang
  start_foo() and stop_foo() functions the way they are, for now. - FM
* Mods in LYGetFile.c so that any '~' in file URLs is handled as when in
  startfile, home page, or 'g'oto commands.  Only the first '~' is converted
  to Home_Dir(), and only for the first symbolic element in the URL, and if
  it is followed by a username, that username is stripped (so that the
  "~username" becomes a reference to the home of the account running Lynx,
  as if only '~' had been used, and can't be used as a reference for an
  arbitrary home).  Note that we don't do this stripping for ftp URLs,
  because the ftp server should decide, itself, whether to grant access to
  arbitrary homes, based on the username and password that were used to
  log in.  Note, also, that if the account running Lynx is allowed access
  to the root of the file system for its home, then access to any arbitrary
  home in that file system can be gained from there.  Access to the root
  never is allowed for file URLs in the for-VMS code, but depends on the
  root's protection in the for-Unix code.  Also, any arbitrary path in file
  URLs will be attempted if it is specified as an absolute path.  The
  stripping of the username from "~username" in most cases on Unix only
  protects against probing for homes in other file systems, without the
  user knowing the corresponding absolute path. - FM
1997-06-11
* Mods in HTAABrow.c, HTTP.c and HTAlert.c so that auth_proxy is no
  longer a module wide global, and the structures which handle/create
  authentication/authorization headers maintain separate setup trees
  for proxy authentication/authorization versus for protected limbs of
  http/https data trees (realms) on the same server.  This ensures that
  each proxy's template, which is the global '*' for all paths (that are
  in fact full URLs) in its proxying requests, are kept distinct from
  the templates for true paths of the protected limbs on the same saver,
  even if the user fails to include that proxy in the no_proxy list, or
  the server's WebMaster fails to do the equivalent configuration for
  the server, and the realm names overlap.  Also modified the prompt
  strings for the username and password to be encrypted for protected
  document requests versus for proxy access so that they indicate
  explicitly whether the user's entries will be used for one or the
  other. - FM
* Added a -pauth=id:pw switch for proxy servers, homologous to the
  -auth=id:pw switch for protected documents, along the lines of AJL's
  patch.  Note that the -pauth value is used only for authorization
  headers to the first protected proxy server encountered, and the -auth
  value is used only for the authorization headers in document requests
  for the first protected limb encountered.  Now that we have an explicit
  switch for proxy authentication, it should be used explicitly for that,
  instead of still allowing use of the -auth=id:pw switch for either
  (IMHO).  Also, there's no serious need to make inclusion of the code
  for handling these switches a compilation option, because they are only
  available to users with shell access.  Updated the help files concerning
  these switches, and included advice to make sure any script files which
  use these switches have restricted access. - FM
1997-06-09
* More refinements of the code in GridText.c, HTML.c and LYCharUtils.c
  for handling visible versus hidden links, blank lines, stripping of
  the numbered brackets for links, and the interactions of these things
  with soft hyphens. - FM
1997-06-06
* Fixed typos in LYrcFile.c which caused failure to start two comments
  on new lines when writing to the RC file. - FM
* Fixed a typo in the lead dot pair stripping code in LYLegitimizeHREF()
  of LYCharUtils.c. - FM
* Tweak of code in GridText.c for handling soft hyphens so that we don't
  display a hyphen if it's the first character in the line, or is preceded
  by a space, even if it is followed by a newline. - FM
* Mods of the hidden link handling and numbered bracket stripping code in
  GridText.c so that it succeeds no matter how many blank lines are in
  the anchor content. - FM
1997-06-04
* Mods in LYLegitimizeHREF() of LYCharUtils.c for dealing more effectively
  with fragments which have illegal characters, as is becoming common due
  to authoring tools such as Microsoft's Frontpage and Netscape's HTML
  editor.  The actual URL-reference is still handled so as to yield a
  fully legitimate absolute URL, without any unescaped spaces, but the
  fragment is checked only for problem characters such as tab or newline,
  and otherwise is unmodified.  (Try the vanilla versus modified code with
  the http://www.cnib.org/library/ww_flw96.htm atrocity, brought to you
  discourtesy of Frontpage. :) - FM
* Worked into the fotemods code use of bold+reverse+underline highlighting
  of WHEREIS search hits for VMS curses, and slang on both VMS and Unix (with
  or without the color mode on), and added code in highlight() of LYUtils.c
  for restoring that highlighting when links are made current or non-current
  if the string for the hit was contained within the string for the link (won't
  be restored if the hit's string starts before or extends past the link's
  string).  Couldn't get any of this to work with curses and the solaris2
  target, so for Unix curses the hit string still is just underlined and
  not restored when links are made current or non-current. - FM
* Fixed typo in the 1997-06-01 LYOptions.c mods. - FM
1997-06-03
* Mods in LYList.c to skip setting up a list block for visible links if
  the document has only hidden links, and in HTML.c to include a notice
  about this with a suggestion to use the 'l'ist command.  Try it with
  the http://www.sony.com/ atrocity. - FM
* Tweak in LYMainLoop.c to fix a longstanding bug which would cause the
  curdoc.line and curdoc.link numbers to be mishandled, and thus cause
  the wrong page and current link to be restored on return to the document
  via PREV_DOC or the History Page, if the document was fetched originally
  with a fragment and a link on its first page had been activated. - FM
* Tweaks in GridText.c so that returns from image map menus to parent
  documents are not treated as if a different document is being sought,
  and thus any no-cache directives associated with the parent will be
  ignored unless another fetch is initiated within the parent or via
  another, externally existing document. - FM
* Added SEEK_FRAG_MAP_IN_CUR and SEEK_FRAG_AREA_IN_CUR configuration
  (lynx.cfg) options for how to resolve USEMAP attribute values in
  IMG or OBJECT tags and HREF attribute values in AREA tags when they
  consist solely of a fragment (USEMAP="#frag" or HREF="#frag").  The
  compilation default is TRUE, i.e., they are resolved with respect
  to the current document's URL, even if the base is different, as is
  being done for the HREF attribute values of Anchors and LINKs.  The
  compilation default seems to be working out, even though most of the
  currently deployed browsers still use the base. - FM
1997-06-02
* Mods in LYMain.c so as not to require that a lone "-" argument for
  invoking input of command line arguments from stdin be the only
  argument on the actual command line.  That requirement preluded use
  of this feature when the command for invoking Lynx was aliased so
  as to include arguments, because the lone "-" then could not be the
  only argument.  Also tweaked the code so that any stdin-derived
  arguments which need to be processed early in main() are so processed.
  The vanilla code had severely flawed logic in this respect.  The
  security considerations associated with switch handling have gotten
  hairy beyond reasonable bounds, but I think I've thought it all through
  (we'll see :), and have plugged some holes in the vanilla code for
  this feature.  Redirection of stdout and/or stderr to a file now also
  works reliably in conjunction with this feature. - FM
* Added an explanation in the PROBLEMS file of the bad getsockname() and
  getpeername() functions within SOCKETSHR 0.9D which affect the ftp
  gateway, and the URLs for Andy Harper's (A.HARPER@kcl.ac.uk) fixes of
  the SOCKETSHR 0.9D sources. - FM
* Cast LYLocal.c into the Lynx programming style. - FM
1997-06-01
* Added support for numbered form fields, and options in SELECT popups,
  based on LE's patch.  The LINKS_AND_FORM_FIELDS_ARE_NUMBERED keypad
  mode can be defined in userdefs.h and via the 'o'ptions menu.  When
  in SELECT popups, the F_LINK_NUM ('0') command can be used in any mode
  to invoke a "Select option (or page) number:" prompt, which can take
  'g' or 'p' suffixes, homologously to the 
  "Follow link (or goto link or page) number:"
  prompt in the main document with popups retracted.  Note that when in
  the main document, the F_LINK_NUM command has an implied 'g' suffix
  for form links (i.e., will position you on the form link, not, for
  example, ACTIVATE a submit button), but *not* in popup windows (i.e.,
  without a 'g' suffix, the option corresponding to the number will be
  selected, and the popup will be retracted, as if you had pressed
  ACTIVATE when positioned on that option).  The 123p feature is quite
  useful in popups with a very large number of options, and supplements
  the HOME, END and WHEREIS functions for seeking positions in the list
  (again, regardless of keypad mode, if F_LINK_NUM is used to invoke
  the prompt).  A "page" is defined as the number of lines within the
  vertical dimension of the popup box. - FM
* Mods in LYEdit.c to seek the current page and line when the editor
  is sedt on VMS. - FM
* Updated the online 'h'elp concerning the "Follow link (or page) number:"
  and "Select option (or page) number:" features (Lynx_users_guide.html,
  follow_help.html, keystroke_help.html and other_help.html). - FM
* changes to help files to reflect the different prompt string. - KW
1997-05-30
* Worked in LE's patch for keeping track of whether links occur in an
  underlining context, and if so, restore it when slang color is on and
  a current link is made non-current, thereby actually dealing with the
  longstanding bug discussed in the 1997-05-27 mods (This is just a hobby,
  and I always reserve the right to change my mind! :). - FM
* Mods of LYForms.c and LYStrings.c to deal with form field values too
  long to fit in the line editor's buffer (such as long TEXTAREA values
  which have no newlines in them).  As much of the tail as fits in the
  buffer is offered for editing, with statusline messages explaining the
  situation.  If the tail is modified, it is combined with the unmodified
  head when the form field is made non-current.  The result can be edited
  further by making the form field current again.  If the form has a
  Reset button, it can be used to restore the original value.  The
  vanilla code would crash on buffer overflow (Ugh!  A potential
  security hole.). - FM
1997-05-29
* Restored underlining in conjunction with reversing for the current link
  with slang when colors are being used, but not otherwise. - FM
* The 1997-05-26 mods to bypass screen redraws on retractions of SELECT
  popups when the selected OPTION was not changed worked properly only
  for VMS curses.  Tweaked the for-slang code so that it now works like
  VMS curses (though not as efficiently).  However, with Unix curses,
  the delwin() - refresh() sequence does not restore what was there
  before the popup was invoked, and none of the tweaks I tried got that
  to work, so the poor Unix folks using Unix curses are now stuck again
  with screen redraws for every popup retraction.  - FM
1997-05-27
* Eliminated in the fotemods code underlining in conjunction with reversing
  for the current link with slang, to avoid the longstanding bug of 
  underlining being lost (and distracting color changes occurring) when that
  link ceases to be current and it was embedded in an underlined region of
  text.  The attributes of the current link can be better handled in the
  development code based on configurable style sheets, so there's no
  point letting this bug ride, nor trying to deal with it through
  temporary internal mods, in the fotemods code set. - FM
1997-05-26
* Mods of display_title() in GridText.c to eliminate the "format"
  mask as in KW's 1997-05-14 development code mods, and to make the
  memory management more efficient. - FM
* Mods of change_form_link() in LYForms.c to bypass the screen redraw
  on retraction of a SELECT popup if the SELECT block is DISABLE-ed
  or the selected OPTION was not changed.  Note that the complete
  elimination of the screen redraw in the 1997-05-20 development code
  mods, i.e., even when the selected OPTION was changed, results in
  the change not being made evident to the user in the retracted popup
  unless the screen is redrawn fortuitously (e.g., due to subsequent
  paging). - FM
* Modified the caching-related changes of 1997-05-15 to LYMainLoop.c,
  handling automatic reloading after a change of the User-Agent string
  like after comparable other option changes.
  We force a reload if "preferred document lan(G)uage"
  or "preferred document c(H)arset" are changed via the 'o'ptions menu,
  and to set the "reloading" flag for forcing a proxy cache refresh if
  those or "user (A)gent" are changed and the current document has an
  http, https or lynxcgi scheme, but not force a proxy cache refresh if
  we're reloading due to an INLINE_TOGGLE, IMAGE_TOGGLE, or RAW_TOGGLE
  command. - KW & FM
1997-05-25
* Mods in LYMain.c to convert $USER if present in the TEMP_SPACE
  definition or LYNX_TEMP_SPACE environment variable to the string
  returned by getenv("USER"). - FM
* Fixed two typos for me->inFONT settings in HTML.c - TD
* Added chmod(file, 0600) calls for most files created by Lynx. - FM
1997-05-24
* integrate patch JED's mods which support mouse for slang as well as add
  new functions to encapsulate differences between slang/curses. - TD
1997-05-21
* Mods in HTML.c and LYCharUtils.c so that TABLE blocks are treated
  as divisions in the DIV nest, with a default alignment of HT_LEFT
  if the TABLE start tag lacks an ALIGN attribute, and otherwise,
  that attribute's value.  Nested TABLEs extend the DIV nest.  This
  avoids the problem in the vanilla code of TABLE content inheriting
  the alignment of a containing CENTER or DIV which is intended for
  alignment of the TABLE as a whole.  Also added support for ALIGN
  attributes in TR elements.  If the TR has no ALIGN attribute, it
  inherits that of the current division, which should be that of the
  current TABLE.  This, of course, still does not yield true TABLEs
  for truly tabular content, but makes TABLEs used for formatting
  more readable. - FM
1997-05-20
* correct 2 occurrences of "me->inFONT == TRUE;" in HTML.c - TD
* add configure --with-color-style option to merge RP's alpha changes for
  color styles (this works only with ncurses, since it does not initialize
  the window background, leaving it null, thereby exploiting a bug in
  ncurses which sets null backgrounds to a space).  Also some whitespace
  (and renamed CS to make this build w/o ncurses) - TD
* test-built with ncurses 1.8.7, 1.9.4, 1.9.9e and 4.0, as well as bsd 4.4
  curses and slang - TD
* Tweak of HTFWriter.c so that it does the anti-spoof tests normally
  done by tempname() (see the 1997-05-19 mods) in all cases for which
  it changes the temporary file suffix from any of those checked by
  tempname() itself.  At this point, every way I've thought of for
  trying to spoof Lynx via links for temporary files is blocked, but
  people should beat on today's code to see if there's any spoofing
  strategy I haven't yet blocked. - FM
* Modified the Lynx Trace Log handling so that it doesn't use actual
  redirection of stderr via freopen() calls, and restores the original
  value of stderr during any escape to shell.  This avoids the problem
  on Unix that sh and ksh send their prompt strings to stderr, and that
  bash sends both its prompt and command line echo to stderr, so they
  end up in the log instead of being visible.  I had tested the initial
  design on VMS and with csh on Unix, and thus didn't notice this
  foolishness for the other Unix shells.  Anyway, it's OK for all of
  them now. - FM
* Tweaked SIGTSTP interrupt handler in the USE_SLANG for-unix code, so
  that it gets set to SIG_DFL when stop_curses() is called, to prevent
  strange interferences experienced when ^Z is used while a helper 
  process is in the foreground. - KW
* Change in LYForms.c to prevent forced screen refresh after selection
  from a popup box. - KW
1997-05-19
* Recognize Linux console F1 key in LYgetch() (applies if -DNO_KEYPAD
  is in effect, as for all binaries built with slang). - KW
* Protect LYgetch() against returning raw values of keypad() symbols
  which are invalid when used later as an index into keymap[],
  override[], etc. - KW
* in the USE_SLANG for-unix start_curses(), honor the no_suspend flag
  if set.  This implements -restrictions=suspend handling for slang 
  (although it was intended for curses implementations which have 
  problems with ^Z within Lynx; see the PROBLEMS file).
  Note that the no_suspend flag cannot be suspected to have
  the desired effect if lynx is executed from a shell script, unless
  the shell process forked for the script also ignores the SIGTSTP
  signal generated (usually) by the ^Z key.  Also if the user is 
  allowed to execute any helper process (VIEWER, PRINTER, etc.) which
  does allow suspending while no_suspend is in effect for the Lynx
  parent process (by overriding the SIG_IGN setting done by Lynx or by 
  other means), then suspending may still be possible, in addition to
  strange effects either immediately or when the process or process group
  is continued (wrong tty and screen state, zombie processes, total
  hang of the session without any way to interrupt - you get the idea...).
  Trying to use the suspend restriction in order to prevent users from
  getting a shell prompt doesn't make much sense anyway when they are
  allowed access to execute commands which may be interrupted or allow
  escaping to a shell... - KW
* Tweak of HTFile.c so that we no longer lose an LYforce_HTML_mode
  directive if the file is gzipped or compressed and the uncompressed
  suffix is not mapped to text/html. - FM
* Modified tempname() in LYUtils.c so that it checks whether files
  with the current PID and target count already exist, and if so,
  increments the count until a name for a non-existing file has been
  created. - FM 
1997-05-18
* Mods in LYMainLoop.c and LYClean.c so that Control-G is treated as
  a synonym for 'n'o in quit confirmation prompts. - FM
* Mods in LYPrint.c to strip any gzip or compress suffix from the
  suggested filename, on the assumption that we're deal with a text/html
  or text/plain file that had a corresponding Content-Encoding and no
  Content-Disposition: file; filename=name.suffix  header indicating
  the appropriate filename after uncompression.  This assumption does
  apply for our current ftp gateway, and for most present-day http
  servers.  This mod in turn ensures that text/html files which are
  not being printed as source will have their uncompressed suffixes
  converted to .txt, indicated that they are rendered. - FM
1997-05-17
* Fixed long-standing bug in display_page() of GridText.c.  When it
  was updating the links structures, it wasn't re-initializing the
  form element if the links structure is not for a form field. - FM
* Mods in HTML.c to deal more effectively with H# headers used instead
  of LH in lists.  We now, in effect, treat them fully as if they were
  LH, so that their left indentations are in register with the current
  list nesting depth, and we apply better error recovery in cases where
  the author is mis-using H# for a FONT change rather than as an actual
  header. - FM
1997-05-16
* Changed the line where a WHEREIS search target should preferably be
  displayed to the 4th line (not counting the title line).  This can
  be changed by redefining SEARCH_GOAL_LINE in userdefs.h.
  SEARCH_GOAL_LINE can also be a simple expression in terms of the
  variable display_lines, e.g. `#define SEARCH_GOAL_LINE (display_lines/3)',
  this should then automatically adapt to screen size changes (provided the
  display system can deal with that...)
  Note that this this goal line will normally not be used if the next 
  target, according to the algorithm Lynx uses, is already on the displayed
  screen.  Also, when the displayed page changes to show a search result,
  there is no guarantee that it will end up on the line set by 
  SEARCH_GOAL_LINE.  It should rather be regarded as a maximum.
  For example the presence of anchors on the line with the target or on
  the preceding lines will change the positioning. - KW
* The SEARCH_GOAL_LINE line will also be used for "going to" a link with
  'g' suffix at the "Follow link ..." prompt, although the algorithm is
  quite different.  As for a search target, this only applies when Lynx
  has to position to a different page of the document, and then is only
  a maximum. - KW
* Enabled the no-cache setting for the pseudo document Lynx creates for
  a client-side image map in LYMap.c, for now. - KW
* Minor typo fix for the proxy authentication mods. - FM
* Tweak of PRE block handling in HTML.c to ensure an implied paragraph
  after the block if it is in a list and not followed by an LI. - FM
* Tweaks of SGML.c and LYCharUtils.c to allow any non-digit to terminate
  a numeric character reference once at least one digit has been found in
  the reference. - FM
* Change in LYUnEscapeToLatinOne() to use isdigit() instead of isalnum()
  for recognizing numeric character references like LYUnEscapeEntities()
  does. - KW
1997-05-15
* Worked in JED's mods for taking a suspend into account during select()
  calls. - FM
* Mods in LYMainLoop.c to not force a cache refresh on a proxy any more
  when INLINE_TOGGLE, IMAGE_TOGGLE, RAW_TOGGLE are used.  On the other
  hand, do force a proxy cache refresh after one of the variables relevant
  for content negotiation `language' or `pref_charset' has been changed
  from the Options screen, if the current document is from a http, https, or
  lynxcgi resource. - KW
* Set HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET environment variable for the child process in
  LYCgi.c if pref_charset is not NULL. - KW
* (chartrans) Write a META tag with the current display character sets to
  the files generated for Bookmarks, List, Info, History, and Visited Links
  pages, so title strings contained in those files will (hopefully) not
  get erroneously translated again.  Use new function LYaddMETAcharsetToFD()
  in LUCharUtils for this purpose. - KW
* (chartrans) makeuctb now sets RawUni to UCT_ENC_8BIT if not otherwise set
  and if there are char values above 127. - KW
* (chartrans) Change in HTuncache_current_document() to prevent caching of
  UCStages info which should be discarded.  Still allow caching for this
  in the node_anchor for source display, so that a META tag in the parsed
  HTML can influence the display after using the SOURCE '\' key. - KW
1997-05-14
* Don't use title in showlist() if it is empty, to prevent "hidden links"
  on the List Page itself caused by documents with <TITLE></TITLE>. - KW
* Changed display_title() in GridText.c to not rely on sprintf() to get
  the number of blanks right. - KW
* (chartrans) Added new lynx.cfg symbols ASSUME_CHARSET, 
  ASSUME_LOCAL_CHARSET, and ASSUME_UNREC_CHARSET.  They are only
  recognized if compiled with -DEXP_CHARTRANS.  They correspond to the
  command line options -assume_charset, -assume_local_charset, and
  -assume_unrec_charset.
  The default for ASSUME_CHARSET is iso-8859-1 (corresponding to display
  character set "ISO Latin 1").  If no ASSUME_LOCAL_CHARSET is set,
  the explicit or default value for ASSUME_CHARSET will also be used for
  local files.  ASSUME_UNREC_CHARSET has no default.  See added text
  in lynx.cfg. - KW
* (chartrans) Changes in LYCharSets.c to HTMLSetCharacterHandling() and
  HTMLSetUseDefaultRawMode() to support (hopefully) more consistent
  and user-friendly handling of raw mode and its default.
  Note that the following description does not apply if the display
  character set is one of the CJK settings.  In that case, -raw and
  the corresponding Options setting is used as a CJK toggle as before.
  Note that the -raw flag is a toggle.  It changes the "raw mode"
  setting from the default.  The current setting of "raw mode" can be
  seen on the Options screen, and is also shown in a statusline message
  when the RAW_TOGGLE key (normally '@') is used.
  The default depends on the display character set (as previously)
  but now also on the ASSUME_CHARSET setting (as determined by a setting
  in lynx.cfg, possibly overridden by -assume_charset on the command 
  line, or the default iso-8859-1).  When the display character set
  corresponds to the ASSUME_CHARSET, the default for "raw mode" is ON,
  otherwise it is OFF.
  The effect of "raw mode" on the interpretation of documents which have
  no explicit charset label (from HTTP headers, a META tag, or otherwise)
  is as follows.  There is an internal "assume charset" which may differ
  from the user-specified ASSUME_CHARSET value.  When "raw mode" is set 
  ON, the internal variable is set to correspond to the display character
  set.  When "raw mode" is set OFF, the internal variable changes to
  the user-specified ASSUME_CHARSET or, if that also corresponds to the
  display character set (so that otherwise there would be no change),
  reverts back to the iso-8859-1 Web default.
  Raw mode doesn't imply total rawness.  HTML character entities may
  be expanded and translated with either setting, 8-bit characters which
  are inappropriate for the display character set will not be sent to
  the terminal.  For a "more raw" setting, try the "Transparent" pseudo
  display character set. - KW
1997-05-13
* Changed the compilation default in userdefs.h for USE_TRACE_LOG
  to FALSE, for now. - KW
* Code for "fixing" of relative http and https URLs which start with a 
  ../ segment from FM added, but it has to be enabled with the new
  lynx.cfg symbol STRIP_DOTDOT_URLS (default currently set to FALSE).
  See FM's description under 1997-04-23. - KW
* Changed the test for dot segment fixing in LYLegitimizeHREF() so
  that now (if enabled) it also applies when the http or https base URL
  in effect does have a non-empty path but without any slashes in it
  (beyond the initial one between host and path).  The test was too narrow
  before and did not recognize this case, so that an unmodified URL with
  ../ in it would still be sent to the server and without generating a
  statusline message. - KW
* Tweak of case LYK_REFRESH: in LYMainLoop.c so that the REFRESH command
  still invokes an obligatory, complete refresh of the screen for slang
  on Unix with the new LY_SLclear() function (see 1997-05-09 mods),
  by using scrollok() if USE_SLANG is defined. - FM
* Changed the local variable name, lines, in follow_link_number() of
  LYGetFile.c to nlines, to deal with the AIX 4.2 bug of treating lines
  as a macro.  Also changed the variable name, pages, to npages for
  logical complementarity (they both refer to the total number). - FM
* Mods in HTML.c, LYCharUtils.c and GridText.c to deal with links for
  positioning, specified via NAME or ID attributes, when they are embedded
  in Anchors which have an HREF, so that they now don't force premature
  closing of those Anchors.  Also tweaked the code for creating links for
  the sources of images or other for-GUI embedded objects when clickable
  images ('*') is toggled on, so they use those mods as well, when
  possible.  Note, however, that the clickable images feature is creating
  Anchors with HREFs which aren't actually there, and still can create
  technically invalid markup, on occasion, when the non-doctored markup
  actually is valid.  The latter mods still need some improvements in the
  formatting, but are OK to use for now, and my brain hurts from trying
  to think through all the possible markup we might encounter. - FM
* Tweaks of the Lynx Trace Log handling to deal with reloads when the
  HText structure for the log has been dumped.  Made the first letter
  of the filename uppercase (Lynx.trace), complementary to Lynx.leaks.
  Eliminated the log from the Visited Links Page so it can't be sought
  there as a forward link.  Use the History Page if you want to 'd'ownload
  the log, or use the 'p'rint option while viewing the log.  Note that
  suffix maps do tail matching, and thus the so-called suffixes need not
  begin with a dot.  If you want to use an external viewer for the log,
  you can put:
  	SUFFIX:Lynx.trace:application/x-LynxTrace
  	VIEWER:application/x-LynxTrace:most +s %s
  in your lynx.cfg, or their equivalents in your mime.types and mailcap
  files. - FM
* Tweaks in LYMainLoop.c to set newdoc.title for various special pages
  generated by Lynx (History Page, Info Page, etc.) and when following
  a link. - FM
* Small change to the heuristics for New_DTD in start_element() 
  in SGML.c (try a bit more to close containing element if it's the
  same tag) - KW
1997-05-12
* Added support for proxy authentication. - AJL & FM
* Updated follow_help.html to indicate that 0 is the universal
  F_LINK_NUM mapping for invoking the "Follow link (or ...) number:"
  prompt. - FM
1997-05-11
* Tweaks in LYMainLoop.c to ensure that the LYforce_HTML_mode flag is
  reset reliably, so it doesn't carry over to requests for text/plain
  documents, as it was doing under some circumstances in the vanilla
  code, e.g., when a bookmark file was used as the startfile via a
  file://localhost/path URL rather than via the -book switch. - FM
* Very minor change in Lynx_users_guide.html, added two words - KW
1997-05-10
* Fixed a typo in statusline() of LYUtils.c.  The check for whether
  the string is zero length before bothering to convert CJK multi-bytes
  was checking a holding buffer instead of the string. - FM
* Fixed a bug in LYHandleMETA() of LYCharUtils.c.  The check for a
  URL following the SECONDS value in REFRESH directives was not
  taking into account that an EOL might follow the digits for the
  SECONDS value. - FM
* Changed the behavior of boolean_choice() in LYOptions.c so that the
  cursor is positioned immediately at the option display line instead
  of staying at the statusline instructions until an initial entry is
  made, and modified the statusline instructions accordingly. - LE & FM
* Added a check for a NULL pointer in the LYCookie.c code for blocking
  sharing of SSL encrypted cookies with http servers, based on a patch
  from RT, and added a comment on why code for a block based on the
  scheme is there, despite its being redundant with the current blanket
  restriction based of the ports. - FM
* Mapped 0 to F_LINK_NUM (as suggested by KW), so that 0 invokes the 
  "Follow link (or goto link or page) number:" prompt under all 
  circumstances (but with the 0 not treated as the first digit of 
  the number entry).  That's a better way
  to do it, because then the F_LINK_NUM command and explanation always
  appears in the "Current Key Map" display, and only the mappings of
  numbers to functions drop out when going from NUMBERS_AS_ARROWS to
  LINKS_ARE_NUMBERS mode (as they should, 'cuz the numbers no longer
  are mapped to functions; though maybe they should stay mapped to
  functions now that we have an explicit command key for invoking the
  prompt; something to think about...). - FM
* Updated the PROBLEMS file to indicate that you should try changing
  -lresolve to -lbind if you have upgraded to the bind-8.1 or later
  library on a Sun system and keep getting the message "Alert!:  Unable
  to connect to remote host". - FM
1997-05-09
* Typo fix in follow_help.html. - FM
* Added an LY_SLclear() function in LYCurses.c as a more efficient
  substitute for slang of the curses clear(), based on a patch from
  JED. - FM
* Added a USE_TRACE_LOG compilation (userdefs.h) symbol and -tlog command
  line toggle of the compilation default (normally TRUE), for directing
  syserr messages to a lynx.trace file in the user's home directory when
  TRACE mode has been turned on (either via the -trace command line switch,
  or the TOGGLE_TRACE (Control-T) command.  Also added a TRACE_LOG command
  (normally ';') for viewing the "Lynx Trace Log" (lynx.trace) at any time,
  if one has been initiated during the current session.  The trace log
  feature is disabled automatically in anonymous or validation accounts,
  and should not be used in any account which could have different users
  simultaneously.  The mods work well to the extent I've exercised them
  thus far on VMS and for the solaris2 target, but possibly need more
  refinements, depending on the behavior for other Unix flavors of
  freopen(), which is used for redirecting stderr to the log.  Updated
  lynx.man, lynx.hlp, and the online 'h'elp to describe these new
  features. - FM
1997-05-08
* Made the handling of hidden links dependent on a new command line
  option.  With -hiddenlinks=listonly hidden links are only shown on
  'l'ist screens and listings generated by -dump or from the 'p'rint
  menu, but appear separately at the end of those lists.
  With -hiddenlinks=ignore they don't appear even in listings.
  With -hiddenlinks=merge hidden links are treated as before,
  i.e. they show up as bracketed numbers if LINKS_ARE_NUMBERED is on,
  and are numbered together with other links in the sequence of their
  occurrence in the document.  The default is -hiddenlinks=listonly.
  Changed the new follow_help.html file accordingly.
  This may help obviate an apparent need to call something a bug which
  others regard as a feature... - KW
* Function HText_AreDifferent() updated as in FM's code, but still 
  unused. - KW
1997-05-07
* Added another argument in follow_link_number() of LYGetFile.c for
  returning the number entered at the "Follow link (or page) number:"
  prompt to the mainloop(), and modified the statusline error messages
  that may be issued from the mainloop() in conjunction the with 'g' or
  'p' suffixes so that they report that number when appropriate. - FM
* Changed the prompt to "Follow link (or goto link or page) number:" - KW
* Tweaked case HTML_DD: in HTML.c so that it checks whether a wrap
  has just occurred naturally before imposing a newline for DD start
  tags.  Without that check, seemingly random, extra newlines could
  occur in the DL/DT/DD blocks. - FM
* Created a follow_help.html for the keystroke_commands subdirectory
  of the online 'h'elp, describing the "Follow link (or page) number:"
  features, and added links to it in Lynx_users_guide.html and
  keystroke_help.html. - FM
* Changed the help description according to what is implemented here - KW
1997-05-06
* Further tweaked KW's mainloop() tweak (see yesterday's entry), so that
  newdoc.link is reinitialized properly when we're going to, but not
  ACTIVATE-ing, a link in the current page due to a 'g' suffix for a
  "Follow link (or page) number:" entry.  Otherwise, if the number with
  a 'g' suffix was used to make the last link on the current page the
  current link, and then a NEXT_LINK command was used, one could end
  up on a link beyond the first one in the next page.  Also added a
  statusline message if the 'g' suffix is used with a number which
  corresponds to a link that already is current. - FM
* Tweaked yesterday's LYList.c mods so that an OL with the CONTINUE
  attribute is used when a "Hidden links:" list is appended to a
  "Visible links:" list and NUMBERS_AS_ARROWS mode is on.  This allows
  you to see the number to enter at "Follow link (or page) number:"
  prompts, as when LINKS_ARE_NUMBERED mode is on. - FM
* Mods in HTML.c for LI and LH handling so that a pointless wrap will not
  occur at the spacer following the bullet in UL blocks or the Arabic
  number, Roman numeral, or upper- or lowercase letter in OL blocks if
  the subsequent text has no spaces, itself, up to the right margin.
  In such cases, that text now stays on the initial LI or LH line, and
  wraps at the right margin to the left indentation for a second or
  greater line in the LI or LH. - FM
* Changes to avoid memory leaks in LYCookie.c - KW
* Escape '<' and '>' characters (using the LYEntify functions) in URL
  strings written to the temporary files for LIST and INFO screens, to
  avoid invalid HTML and corrupted display as a result of URLs which
  contain these characters (although they shouldn't) and have not been
  escaped earlier. - KW
* Changed the label for the currently selected link from "Filename:"
  to "URL:", and fixed an alignment glitch for the 9th item on the
  History and Visited Links pages. - KW
* Changed an "8-bit" occurring in HtInit.c to "8bit", tweaked LYKeymap.c
  comments. - KW
1997-05-05
* Added HText_AddHiddenLink(), HText_HiddenLinkCount(), and
  HText_HiddenLinkAt() functions in GridText.c for keeping track of the
  addresses (URL, plus fragment if present) for links that were converted
  to hidden by HText_endAnchor() due to their having no visible link name,
  and modified showlist() and printlist() in LYList.c so that if any hidden
  links were create during the rendition, the "References in this document:"
  menu for the 'l'ist command or appendix on dumps segregates and clearly
  labels the visible versus hidden links. - FM
* Plugged a memory leak in LYEntify() of LYCharUtils.c. - FM
* Modified experimental DTD info to not close anchors when an invalid 
  P, H1-H6, or ADDRESS start tag is encountered, and to change error
  recovery for P and MAP. - KW
* Modified experimental DTD info and HTML.c to not close PRE when
  an invalid FORM start tag is encountered, and to use the appropriate
  handling for preformatted text if PRE is in effect but is not the top 
  element on HTML.c's stack.  The HTStyle structure's freeFormat (which 
  wasn't used anywhere before) is now used as one test whether we are 
  within preformatted text, also corrected the style setting of freeFormat
  for PRE in DefaultStyle.c. - KW
* Changed internal gateways (in HTNews.c, HTFile.c, HTWAIS.c, HTWSRC.c)
  to end LI, DT, and DD elements if they are not declared SGML_EMPTY,
  so that HTML.c's stack won't get overloaded in this case. - KW
* Tweaks in mainloop() handling of DO_GOTOLINK_STUFF and DO_GOTOPAGE_STUFF.
  Going to a link with the 'g' suffix and then immediately ACTIVATing that
  link could previously show the wrong page of the new document, since
  newdoc.line was not being reset. - KW
1997-05-03
* (chartrans) Now always check for LYlowest_eightbit[current_char_set]
  near the top of HText_appendCharacter(), to prevent writing C1 control 
  chars to the terminal if they are not valid as displayable characters 
  according to the selected "display character set" Option.
  All this should be handled earlier in processing, and this check may
  disappear again for testing, but somebody asked for it... - KW
* (chartrans) Small changes to README files. - KW
* In the section of HTUtils.h for non-autoconf builds, don't set 
  HAVE_KEYPAD or HAVE_TTYTYPE if USE_SLANG is defined. - KW
* Modified HText_LinksInLines() to not count hidden form fields. - KW 
* Added support for setting an anchor's no_cache element based on a
  comparison between Expires and Date headers if both were received
  and we didn't set it based on a Cache-Control directive.  Also
  added equivalent support for a comparison between an Expires value
  from a META tag and a Date header.  We still compare Expires header
  or META values versus the system time if no Date header was received,
  and still do not accept Date values from META tags because they are
  unlikely to be reliable. - FM
1997-05-02
* Fixed a bug in LYAddImageMap() of LYMap.c which could cause multiple
  insertions of the same MAP into the LynxMaps structure, and crashes
  on some systems due to the consequent multiple FREE()'s at exit. - FM
1997-05-01
* More mods in HTML.c, LYCharUtils.c and GridText.c for rational handling
  of potentially wrapped form fields in PRE blocks.  We now artificially
  wrap the line if the form field would start within 6 columns from the
  right margin.  This makes sure that editing windows and the highlighted
  segments of submit or reset buttons will not ever be ridiculously short,
  and is homologous to our use of a collapsible space before input fields
  and buttons when not in PRE blocks to promote a wrap there instead of
  within the fields or buttons. - FM
* Expanded the WHEREIS query support so that it also locates the values
  of form fields within the current document and repositions or pages
  accordingly, as for normal (Anchor) links and for text strings.  Note
  that if the hit was for an OPTION value in a retracted SELECT popup,
  you are positioned on the retracted window, and must pop it up and
  search again to be positioned on the OPTION value with the hit, unless
  it already is the selected OPTION.  The mods are hairy enough without
  trying to do the latter automatically, at least for now. - FM
1997-04-30
* Quote the URL for external command (not for VMS or DOS or Windows)
  to avoid dangerous chars and shell spoofing. - KW
* Escape characters properly when constructing URLs from filenames
  in LYConvertToURL.  If a string given for startfile, home page, or
  a goto command which does not already have the form of an absolute 
  URL starting with an URL scheme and which does not start with '~' 
  (but may start with '/') specifies an existing file or directory in 
  valid Unix-like format for the native filesystem, i.e. without using
  escaping, it gets URL-escaped, otherwise it is assumed to already
  be URL-escaped. - KW
1997-04-29
* Updated RP Styles 0.2 code, don't allow comma as separator between
  fg and bg colors after all, fix the LYNX_VERSION string generation
  in userdefs.h to have `-Styles' appended *within* the quoted string. - KW
* Added support for a 'p' suffix, like the 'g' suffix for making a link
  number the current link rather than ACTIVATE-ing it,
  but for displaying the page indicated by the number preceding the
  'p' suffix entered at the "follow link (or goto link or page) number:" 
  prompt.  [...]  If the number
  entered at the prompt is '1' or less followed by the 'p' suffix, or only
  'p' is entered, you get the same behavior as for the HOME command.  If
  the number is equal to or greater than the number of pages, you get the
  last page displayed as you would if you had used successive PAGE_DOWN
  commands from the HOME position to reach it.  This differs from the END
  command, which fills the screen with lines from the end of the document
  if you are not already displaying the end of the document.  Note that if
  you enter a number without a suffix (to ACTIVATE the link with that number)
  or with the 'g' suffix (to make the link with that number the current link)
  it must correspond to a valid link number or an error statusline message
  will be issued, in contrast to the 'p' suffix for which an out of range
  number is treated as a request to display the first or last actual page in
  the current document. - FM
* Fixed some typos in lynx.man. - LWV
* More modifications of the anchor counting code for HTGetLinkInfo() in
  GridText.c so that it properly skips hidden form fields and anchors
  without selectable text. - KW
* More modifications in GridText.c and HTML.c so that it deals rationally
  with submit or reset button values, and the underscore placeholders for
  other form fields, when in versus not in PRE blocks.  The entire submit
  or reset button values are now always displayed, whether or not a portion
  of it was wrapped, but we still can only highlight the portion before the
  wrap to indicate a link for submission of the form or for resetting the
  form field values. - FM
* Undid some mysterious changes in SIGHUP setting (SIG_IGN vs. SIG_DFL)
  which had sneaked in in connection with adding the NOSIGHUP
  conditional. - KW
* Tweaks to New DTD's extra info for CENTER and H1..H6 - KW
* New function HText_AreDifferent() from FM added to GridText.c, but
  not used yet. - KW
* Tweaks to WB's additions for external command: use strncasecomp, add
  LYExtern.o to src/makefile.in, changed test for empty command. - KW
* Changed LYKeymap.h and LYKeymap.c so they agree about the symbols
  assigned to the new keys (SWITCH_DTD, EXTERN). - KW
* correct minor syntax err that caused SCO 3.x to fail make-include
  autoconf test.  also, eliminate whitespace before '#' that causes
  compile-fail on K&R compilers. - TD
1997-04-28
* Updated lynx_url_support.html so as to make clear that the offer to
  include the currently displayed document with right-angle-bracket
  prefixing for mailto, newsreply, and snewsreply URLs is made only if
  the user has defined an external editor via the Options Menu, and that
  the user is expected to edit this inclusion so that it retains only
  those passages relevant to the email or followup message which the
  user will add. - FM
* Tweak of INPUT handling in HTML.c so that we use nbsp instead of any
  spaces when loading a submit or reset button's actual value instead
  of a series of underscores into the HText structure, so that we
  still promote a wrap, if needed, at the space we ensured would be
  present before each INPUT. - FM
* Made first_option a structure member rather than a static variable 
  in HTML.c - KW
1997-04-27
* Tweak of Control-C and Control-G handling for popup_options() in
  LYForms.c.  They were being sought improperly as command keys rather
  than as raw keyboard entries.  Note that only Control-G should be
  used as "cancel" within popup windows on Unix, because Control-C
  is not being trapped to a handler as on VMS. - LE & FM 
* Tweak of the anchor counting code for HTGetLinkInfo() in GridText.c
  so that it takes form fields into account when making a link current
  based on a "Follow link number" entry with the 'g' suffix.
  Also added comments to that code. - KW
1997-04-25
* Added information in the "Lynx bookmarks" section of the Users Guide
  about appropriate versus unsupported modifications when editing the
  bookmark files. - FM
* RP Styles 0.2 fixed a bit and brought up to current experimental code 
  level (no autoconfig or simple-curses, only older version of Wayne's 
  mods, maybe something else is missing, too).  No documentation, no
  detailed checking, no real cleanup.  Makefile slightly adapted,
  but still needs changing for new systems - see comments there. - KW
1997-04-24
* Tweaks for enhanced mouse support in Win32 and hooks for 386 which
  doesn't have mouse support yet. - WB
* External command added.  See LYExtern.* in src and lynx.cfg.
  You need to define USE_EXTERNALS to compile this in. - WB
1997-04-23
* Modified LYCharUtils.c, HTML.c and LYMessages_en.h so that if a
  partial reference (HREF or SRC value) would be resolved to an http
  or https URL which has only two dots as the first symbolic element in
  the path (e.g., http://host/../foo.html), such that the server would
  reject the request, that element is excluded from the resultant URL,
  but a statusline message is issued (once per document) about a bad
  partial reference, as immediate feedback which might lead to the
  document provider correcting the bad partial reference(s).  We still
  retain that first symbolic element, in compliance with the IETF RFCs
  and IDs for resolving URLs, with other URL schemes (e.g., ftp). - FM
* Added a skip_stack int to the HTML.h struct _HTStructured, to use
  for flagging that the next call to HTML_start_element or 
  HTML_end_element is an internal shortcut and should skip pushing
  or popping the HTML.c paragraph style stack even for elements
  that are not declared SGML_EMPTY.  Added a SET_SKIP_STACK macro
  to HTML.c to set the flag, use it. - KW
* Changes to HTML.c to better deal with a number of elements which may
  or may not have been declared SGML_EMPTY in HTMLDTD.c:
  if the last stacked element is HTML_OPTION, treat text as for
  HTML_SELECT in HTML_put_character and HTML_put_character and 
  HTML_put_string.  Added handling code for </P> to HTML_end_element
  (similar but not identical to that for P in HTML_start_element).
  Added check whether a SELECT is still open to FORM handling in
  HTML_end_element.  Added check whether a FORM is open to SELECT
  handling in HTML_end_element.  Added cases for end tags of
  TABLE-related elements (TR, THEAD, TFOOT, TBODY, COLGROUP, TH, TD)
  and of DT, DD, LH, LI, FONT, OVERLAY to the switch in
  HTML_end_element, currently just break from the switch. - KW
* Some tweaks and corrections to the additional element info and
  to the content types used with New_DTD, in HTMLDTD.c.  Made
  OPTION non-empty. - KW
* Now changed the tags_old[] in HTMLDTD.c, which is used with the
  switchable "old" SGML parsing, to follow the changes for A, B, 
  BLINK, CITE, EM, FONT, I, STRONG, and U mentioned in the entry
  of 1997-04-15.  These, together with FORM and P, are all declared
  as SGML_EMPTY now when the "old" SGML parsing is in effect, but
  not with new parsing. - KW
* Changes to LYMail.c and LYPrint.c to send Content-Transfer-Encoding
  headers and/or a charset parameter when mailing, based on idea from
  Hynek Med.  Don't use charset if we only have 7-bit characters
  anyway.  If compiled with EXP_CHARTRANS, use MIME name corresponding
  to display character set if it looks valid (not "x-"), otherwise
  only an explicitly given document charset.  In the chartrans case,
  don't send charset parameter for CJK since it may be wrong... - KW
* Added TRACE output to UCAuto.c - HM
1997-04-22
* refined check for slang libraries/headers by checking if $CFLAGS has been
  set so that slang.h is in the search path - TD
* add check to allow use of broken ncurses 1.9.9e's color - TD
* add check for NGROUPS, TRUE, FALSE macro definitions - TD
* remove top-level makefile.in targets that can be combined with the generic
  target (more work required on the remaining ones) - TD.
* Plugged memory leak in deleteLinks() of HTAnchor.c. - KW
* When dumping or outputting a rendered document via the 'p'rint menu,
  Lynx would use the underscore placeholders for submit/image/reset
  buttons as for other INPUT fields.  We now load the values of
  submit/image/reset buttons instead of placeholders into the HText
  structure, so the values will be seen when dumping or outputting
  via the 'p'rint menu.  See the comments under case HTML_INPUT: in
  HTML.c for the still less than optimal things that happen if a
  wrap occurs within the INPUT value or placeholder strings, as might
  happen in PRE blocks, or for strings wider than the screen. - LE & FM
* SGML_abort() did not free memory used by the SGML.c parser stack.
  Now it does, but still doesn't call HTML_end_element() for the
  stacked elements (it's an abort after all...) - KW
1997-04-21
* Tweaks of the 1997-04-11 and 1997-04-09 mods in HText_endAnchor() of
  GridText.c so as to take possible wrapping of Anchor content into
  account when deciding whether or not to implement the Anchor as an
  ACTIVATE-able link. - FM
* New SGML.c parser, and new HTMLDTD.c with additional element info.
  Extra content information for each tag is now included in the
  HTTag structure, and given in an extended tags_new[] table in
  HTMLDTD.c.  Modified start_element() and end_element() in SGML.c
  to perform some heuristic wind-downs of the parsing stack, based
  on the extra element info. - KW
* Revert treatment of some tags which were treated as SGML_EMPTY
  before to their "natural" content model.  No changes made to
  HTML.c to accommodate this change, so results may differ where
  HTML.c relies on previous hacks or has now handling code for
  end tags of elements which were previously SGML_EMPTY. - KW
* Made SGML parsing switchable between old and new HTMLDTD info
  and SGML.c code, controlled by a New_DTD global variable and
  LYK_SWITCH_DTD toggle key.  Use (temporarily?) ^V for the toggle key.
  This is not yet changeable via command line, lynx.cfg, etc., and the 
  default is New_DTD==YES (so that it gets tested :-) ). - KW
* Made some of the error messages before exit in LYMainLoop.c and 
  LYMain.c go to stderr instead of stdout, but only for UNIX and,
  in the case of the LYMainLoop.c messages, only if
  dump_output_immediately was in effect. - KW
1997-04-20
* Tweaks in LYCharUtils.c to bind META CONTENT to a header value only
  via an HTTP-EQUIV attribute (i.e., not via a NAME attribute). - FM
* Mod in HTAccess.c to ignore the anchor's no_cache element if we're
  seeking a position in the currently loaded document. - FM
* Commented out the above change in HTAccess.c.  There's a more complete
  mechanism for it already in this code... - KW
* Fixed a typo in the bookmark file lead text. - DK (Doug Kaufman
  <dkaufman@rahul.net>)
1997-04-19
* Changed the inappropriate StrAllocCat() to StrAllocCopy() for
  loading the XLOADIMAGE_COMMAND in LYReadCFG.c. - PC
1997-04-18
* Based on recent discussions in www-html@w3.org, added HY and SHY
  to the DTD (treated as synonyms; one or the other is most likely
  to be used in future HTML specs, so for now, we support both), as
  markup equivalent to the named entity &shy; and numeric character
  reference &#173; (soft hyphen).  Note that Lynx implements soft
  hyphens as specified in IETF RFC 2070 (link "HTML i18n" in the
  Users Guide).  Use of a tag instead of entity is preferable for
  a soft hyphen because browsers which do not support soft hyphen
  will ignore it as an "unknown tag" instead of inappropriately
  inserting a hyphen or displaying the raw entity.  Also added WBR,
  which is handled like soft hyphen (indicating a permissible wrap
  point), but does not insert a hyphen at the wrap. - FM
1997-04-17
* Mods in HTML.c, HTML.h, and LYMessages_en.h to issue an HTML stack
  overrun message only once per document, and as a statusline message
  if not in TRACE mode, and to check in HTML_end_element() for
  correspondence between the SGML and HTML stacks if an overrun should
  occur. - FM
* Corrections in HTML.c for the bounds checks associated with DIV and
  CENTER nesting levels, and for an HTML stack underrun. - KW
* Plugged a memory leak under case HTML_IMG: of HTML_start_element() in
  HTML.c, and removed an inappropriate if(){} in HText_endAnchor() of
  GridText.c. - FM & KW
* Modified the lead text created for bookmark files in LYBookmark.c so
  that it indicates that an editor can be used to delete or reorder
  the links, but that the format within lines should not be changed,
  nor other HTML markup added.  Note that the new lead text will be
  used only when new bookmark files are created via the 'a'dd bookmark
  link command.  A new bookmark file is not created if the one being
  sought already exists, so existing ones will still have the old
  lead text. - FM
1997-04-16
* Extensive changes to try to keep track of whether a document (or 
  a location within it) was reached by an internal (fragment-only)
  URL reference or not.  The basic idea is to be serious about I-D
  (currently) draft-fielding-url-syntax-04.txt.  
  URL references starting with '#' are always to the current
  document (from which the reference is made). This leads to a
  lot of hackery in HTML.c, LYMainLoop.c, LYHistory.c, etc. etc...
  to distinguish a doc that was reached by an "internal" reference
  from others.  But it seems necessary to keep track of how the
  reference to a fragment was specified, whether with a non-empty
  "real" URL (possibly relative) preceding the '#' or without it, 
  all the way way from the HTML parsing to the mainloop.  Only then
  can the mainloop decide to not start a new retrieval for an internal
  reference without skipping a new retrieval if a full URL reference
  with fragment is made to a location in the same document (which
  may be non-cachable or the result of a POST)...
  This code prevents unnecessary/inappropriate POST form resubmissions
  on following an internal link in a POST response, as they are
  present for example in WebTechs validation results. - KW
* A "Goto numbered link" feature.  The user interface could be improved...
  Start typing the link number, then add 'g' before hitting enter.
* Some improvements to WHEREIS search.  Will not always position
  found string on first line (details depend on whether anchors are
  present, usually will position in top third of screen), and avoid
  some unnecessary screen updates. - KW
1997-04-15
* Miscellaneous additional tweaks in HTML.c for more robust error recovery
  from bad HTML involving emphasis or style elements (B, BLINK, CITE, EM,
  FONT, I, STRONG, and U), or HREF-less NAME-ed Anchors without matching
  end tags. - FM
* Modified the declarations in HTMLDTD.c and code in SGML.C, HTML.c, and
  GridText.c to handle A, B, BLINK, CITE, EM, FONT, I, STRONG, and U
  container elements homologously to the modified handling of FORM (see
  1997-04-05 mods) so that if they are invalidly interdigitated or have
  spurious end tags in the markup, substitutions of the "expected" end
  tags by the SGML.c stack-based parser will not be made, and without
  messing up the HTML.c stack-based parser.  Appears to work reliably
  for all of the elements, and to be reasonably crash safe (hopefully
  as safe as the vanilla v2.7.1), but there are no guarantees. - FM
* Only *some* (most?) of the changes described in the above two
  entries are used, as far as they change HTML.c.  Not yet using the
  changes to HTMLDTD.c and SGML.c. - KW
* refined logic of SVr4 curses color support to test the no_color_video
  attribute - TD
* ifdef'd NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION logic to allow build with ncurses 1.9.4 - TD
* ifdef'd wgetbkgd misspelling to allow build with ncurses prior to 1.9.9g - TD
* document USE_MOUSE configuration-option - TD
* modify configure script and makefile.in templates to make BSDI_Makefile
  obsolete - TD
* rename config.h to lynx_cfg.h to minimize conflict when configuring against
  ncurses or slang in nonstandard locations - TD
* new autoconf macro CF_HEADER_PATH is used to make header-search for slang
  the same as ncurses - TD
* modify CF_CURSES_LIBS, CF_NCURSES_LIBS and CF_SLANG_LIBS to accommodate
  predefinition of $LIBS variable - TD
* corrected autoconf'd compiler flags for Ultrix - TD
* add config.guess & config.sub to allow specialized host-type checks - TD
* guard against redefinition of NO_FILIO_H - TD
* use new autoconf macro CF_SYSTEM_MAIL_FLAGS /jes
1997-04-14
* Tweaked LYAddImageMap() in LYMap.c so that it removes all pre-existing
  AREA element entries when updating MAP element content, and set the
  no_cache anchor element in LYLoadIMGmap() so that the updated MAPs
  always will be used when rendering. - FM
* Not using the no_cache change from last entry, until further 
  investigation. - KW
* Removed two spurious lines under case LYK_PRINT: in LYMainLoop.c
  (from an old cut and paste from case LYK_HISTORY: done too late
  at night 8-). - FM
1997-04-13
* Modified the handling of BASE for resolving HREFs in relation to MAP
  and AREA elements, and USEMAPs in IMG and OBJECT elements.  The
  formally released code was treating such links equivalently to the
  handling of fragments for positioning the display to ID-ed elements
  or NAME-ed Anchors, and assuming they're in the same document if the
  associated HREF value begins with a '#', rather than resolving versus
  the BASE, and was always resolving versus the BASE for MAP ID or NAME
  attributes, and for the AREA HREFs in MAP content.  We now always
  resolve the MAP ID or NAME attributes versus the current stream's
  address (since the MAP must be in it or we wouldn't be handling it)
  [...] According to the
  original draft and the current HTML 3.2 Proposed Standard,
  MAPs need not be in the same document as the IMG or OBJECT elements
  which specify links to the MAPs.  Because MAPs are "deferred objects",
  they logically should be placed above any IMG or OBJECT elements which
  reference them in the same document (as is done for SCRIPTs), but this
  isn't stated in the specs, nor always done in practice.  [...]
  ([A]uthors who place the MAPs further down in the same document should be
  informed about "deferred objects" and encouraged to move them up 8-). - FM
* Use logical extension of the rules for HREF references also for
  USEMAP references to MAPs: relative URL references are resolved with
  respect to a BASE element if one is present in the document where they
  occur, unless they are URL references without a URL, i.e. only a
  fragment starting with '#'.  In the latter case they are taken as
  internal references referring to a MAP in the same document where
  the USEMAP occurs, whether the MAP occurs before the USEMAP (as it
  should, according to previous entry) or after the USEMAP. 
  HREF's in AREA elements follow the same rules. - KW
* Fixed bug in HTML_free() for the case when LYMapsOnly is set.  We
  didn't create an HText structure for the stream (just scanned it for
  MAPs and processed them into LYMap.c's LynxMaps structure), nor do
  we want to create a blank one (as was being done) since we didn't
  render the stream, nor would we have a me->target set.  So we just
  free any me elements that might still be allocated (though they
  should have been freed already), and return rather than continuing
  through the rest of the HTML_free() code. - FM
1997-04-11
* Fixed bugs in Gridtext.c and HTML.c which could cause mishandling
  of anchors in LINKS_ARE_NUMBERS mode if a line wrap occurred in
  the numbered bracket or the anchor content following the bracket,
  and failures to suppress the numbered bracket if the anchor content
  was empty due to ALT="" in an IMG tag, or if Lynx was configured or
  toggled to suppress the link for the server-side image map if both
  ISMAP and USEMAP attibutes were present in the IMG tag. - FM
* Only using the number-removing code under additional conditions:
  ISMAPs which appear together with USEMAPs and which are suppressed
  with LYNoISMAPifUSEMAP in LINKS_ARE_NUMBERS mode. - KW
* Extended the disk_save restriction to the print menu as well as
  the download menu, and accordingly updated lynx.hlp, lynx.man, and
  Lynx_users_guide.html. -  HN & FM
1997-04-09
* Many changes to further the Win32 and 386 ports.  An emulation of
  the HTVMS_ calls was used to try and cover all the DOS'izms.
  A specialized ifdef for pdcurses color mapping added.  Some keypad
  tweaks.  More generalized process spawning.  .lynxrc is lynx.rc for 386.
  - WB
* Tweak to ensure that a newline isn't inserted by virtue of a
  FORM start tag if it's in the first line of a list element and
  no text precedes it other than a UL's bullet or OL's number
  on that line. -  FM
* Added pauses for the "Bad HTML" statusline messages under cases
  HTML_HTML and HTML_BODY in HTML_end_element(), and eliminated
  their checks for an unclosed FORM because we no longer expect
  that to cause a serious problem. - LE & FM
* Added a NO_ISMAP_IF_USEMAP configuration symbol and -ismap
  command line toggle for suppressing inclusion of a link for the
  server-side-image-map if an IMG or OBJECT element has both ISMAP
  and USEMAP attributes such that a client-side-image-map link is
  created.  Updated lynx.man, lynx.hlp and Lynx_users_guide.html
  accordingly. - FM
* Fixed a glitch in HText_endAnchor() of Gridtext.c which could
  cause dangling Anchors in LINKS_ARE_NUMBERED mode if the Anchor's
  content was handled in a manner which caused it to become zero
  length. - FM
* Moved handling for NEWS_POSTING in LYReadCFG.c to the right place,
  so that it can actually have an effect. - LWV
* Typo fixes for the comment concerning NO_ANONYMOUS_EMAIL in
  userdefs.h - HN & FM
1997-04-08
* New translation table koi8r_uni for KOI8-R charset.  Lynx can now
  translate between iso-8859-5 and KOI8-R, at least for the Cyrillic
  characters present in both. - KW
* New translation table def7_uni with default 7-bit mappings 
  (replacement representation).  Based on RFC1345 and mnemonic,ds
  from ftp://dkuug.dk/i18n/ and previous Lynx replacements
  in LYCharSets.c and IPA FAQ convention and stuff for Ethiopic and
  KOI8-R.  It maps many of the accented Latin characters present in
  Unicode to their unaccented counterparts.  This table is now
  used for the "7 bit approximations" display "character set". - KW
* Entities for Latin2 characters added to HTMLDTD.c  These also
  include many entity names for ASCII characters, and characters
  which are in both iso-8859-1 and iso-8859-2. - Hynek Med
* Changes to the non-chartrans translation tables in LYCharSets.c
  for &Dstrok;, &ETH;, and &eth;.  Treat &Dstrok; more like
  an entity for the (Latin-2) Unicode character U+0110, since
  that seems to be SGML standard usage. - KW
* Added mappings for some "smart quote" characters to several
  translation tables. - KW
* Make makeuctb slightly more flexible (accept unicode range for
  mapping to single code point). - KW
1997-04-07
* Took out special-case handling in the curses-color code for underlining 
  when lynx is running under Linux using the linux console with color.  
  The code was introduced on 1997-03-12 and would ignore "smul" capability
  info from terminfo or termcap under those circumstances, always using
  bold instead of underline. - KW
* Slightly modified the FORM handling patch of 1997-04-05, as follows:
  Use a generic test for a non-SGML_EMPTY element for bypassing the
  stack pop in HTML_end_element() of HTML.c instead of an explicit
  test for HTML_FORM. - KW
1997-04-06
* Patch for IMG elements which have both ISMAP and USEMAP in effect.
  In HTML_start_element() don't generate the "[ISMAP]-" string for 
  output in this case, unless clickable_images is set TRUE. - KW
1997-04-05
* Patch for Lynx v2.7.1 to handle invalidly interdigitated container
  elements or spurious container end tags without substitutions of
  "expected" FORM end tags by the SGML.c stack-based parser, and
  without messing up the HTML.c stack-based parser.  Reliably succeeds
  in not closing FORMs before all of the FORM elements, including
  submit buttons, have been processed.  Should be reasonably crash
  safe (hopefully as safe as the vanilla v2.7.1), but there are no
  guarantees. - FM
1997-04-04
============================================================================
---  Release of Lynx2-7 + BUGFIXES as Lynx v2.7.1 (April 4, 1997) by FM  ---
============================================================================
* Note that 2.7.1 was not a release from this code set, but all 2.7 -> 2.7.1
  bugfixes and other changes are also included in this code set, in either
  identical or equivalent form.  Therefore the entries below this point
  comprise the 2.7 -> 2.7.1 changes, and additionally other changes made to
  the development code set during that time. - KW
1997-04-02
* add Andrew Kuchling's patch to support mouse-clicks with ncurses. - TD
* refine tests that address porting problems to SCO (detecting struct winsize,
  workaround for misdefinition of 'remove')
* refine CF_COLOR_CURSES test to avoid ncurses 1.9.9e bugs. - TD
* refine CF_PATH_PROG to allow for machines that haven't the given programs,
  by using only the program name and added configure option
  --disable-full-paths to enforce this behavior. - TD
* fixes for some gcc compiler warnings (missing prototypes, unused variables,
  uninitialized variables, shadowed variables). - TD
* Fixed typos in LYHistory.c, LYMail.c and LYMain.c which caused
  failures of flag setting in the distributed code. - TD
* correct cast in HTFWriter.c that may break if atoi() is not prototyped. - TD
* add top-level makefile target 'maintainer-clean', use this to remove
  Lynx.prj - TD
1997-03-31
* Added a missing check for whether the fragment token is NULL in
  LYConvertToURL() of LYUtils.c.  Without the check, the for-Unix code
  could crash if a local file spec was entered as a startfile or goto
  with escaped characters. - KW
* Mod in HTML.c to retain "[INLINE]" as the default ALT string if an
  IMG element has an ISMAP attribute but is not in Anchor content such
  that it could not in fact function as a server-side image map. - FM
1997-03-27
* In mainloop(), after the call to HText_pageDisplay() following a change
  of the document view, ensure that curdoc.link does not remain set to -1 
  if there are any links on the screen.  This would otherwise happen if
  a document is pushed to the history stack while there are no links, and
  later popped (and refreshed) after one or more links have been created.
  This change prevents segmentation faults which occurred after creation
  of a new file in a previously empty directory via the DIRED menu.  The
  access to invalid memory only occurred if the screen showing the empty
  directory did not have a parent dir reference link (which is always the
  case if NO_PARENT_DIR_REFERENCE was specified at compilation time). - KW
* In LYLocal.c, modified the code handling DIRED_MENU to do more careful
  checking of the selected file.  In addition to "TAG", "FILE", and "DIR", 
  DIRED_MENU definitions in lynx.cfg now also recognize LINK as a type.
  DIRED_MENU definitions with a type field of "LINK" are only used if the
  current selection is a symbolic link ("FILE" and "DIR" definitions are
  not used in that case).  The default menu definitions have been updated
  to reflect this change, and to avoid the showing of menu items whose
  action would always fail - KW
* Some cleanup to eliminate compiler warnings, remove some unused 
  variables - KW
* Fixed a typo and added comments for the code in LYMainLoop.c which
  decides whether to load the URLs for homepage and/or startfile into
  the goto buffer at startup.  The typo in the distributed code caused
  the startfile URL always to be added to the goto buffer, even if
  it had POST content such that it could be resent inappropriately
  as a GET request via the goto buffer. - FM
* Added a bsdi-slang target to the Makefile. - Laura Eaves
1997-03-26
* Changed highlighting of strings found by a WHEREIS ('/') search.
  Now uses Christmas tree attribute combination ("all bits are on"),
  which with color support translates to COLOR:7. - KW
* Modified the HTStream structure and associated code in src/HTFWriter.c
  so that we save and use the relevant content of the associated
  HTPresentation structure as two HTFormat elements rather than via a
  pointer to the HTPresentation structure itself, because the latter
  structure might not be valid under some circumstances when
  HTFWriter_free() is called.  The distributed code might indirectly
  result in segmentation faults during downloading on Linux and some
  other flavors of Unix (though they don't occur for most flavors, or
  on VMS). - KW
1997-03-23
* Further reduction of top-level makefile.in by moving definitions out of
  WWW/Implementation/*/Makefile, so only one is needed for autoconfigured
  build (i.e., WWW/Implementation/unix/Makefile).  This highlights the
  remaining differences between the top-level targets - TD
* Make configure script generate Unix makefiles in subdirectories, a step
  toward being able to run make from any directory, for development - TD
* Add autoconf tests for paths of programs, including sendmail vs mmdf - TD
* Add configure script options for development (--disable-echo, --enable-debug,
  --enable-find-leaks, --enable-warnings) - TD
* Allow user to override search path for ncurses header by setting $CFLAGS or
  $CPPFLAGS - TD
* Correct array limit in LYCurses.c for SVr4 color support - TD
* Use addstr rather than printw in popup-forms to address concern about 8-bit
  characters - TD
1997-03-21
* Changes in auto config handling of ncurses header location, function
  used for reading terminal input, some other system dependent tweaks
  (including SCO broken remove, time.h) - TD
* Fix for popup handling with late ncurses versions (uses wprintw
  instead of waddstr in LYForms.c) - TD
* Mods in LYPrint.c to use ".txt" as the output file extension for
  all rendered text/html files regardless of their original extension.
  The distributed code was doing this only for ones with an extension
  of ".html".  The original extension still is retained if the file
  is being output as source. - FM
* Added protection against passing a NULL pointer for path_url to
  render_item() from dired_options() in LYLocal.c. - GN
1997-03-20
* Tweaked the protection against URLs directed to port 19 or port 25 so
  that it can't be circumvented via lead zeros in the port numbers. - FM
* Changed the compilation default so as not to send From MIME headers to
  http or https servers.  The default can still be changed via lynx.cfg.
  Replaced the -nofrom disabling switch to a -from switch for toggling
  the compilation or configuration default.  Sending the From header
  has become widely regarded as an invasion of privacy risk, particularly
  in conjunction with cookie support. - FM
* Corrected a typo in the lynx.cfg comments concerning TRUSTED_LYNXCGI
  rules. - KW
1997-03-17
* Mods of LYNews.c and LYMail.c to prepend a "-- " separator before
  appending the LYNX_SIG_FILE signature file to news and email
  messages. - FM
* Made the installation mode 755 in the top-level Makefile.  The
  distributed code used 555, and some install commands were unable
  to do the strip. - LWV
1997-03-14
* Corrected typos and expanded the comments concerning lynxcgi symbols
  in userdefs.h and lynx.cfg. - FM
* Modified SGML.c to handle the numeric character reference &#8482; as
  the named entity &trade; also in the non-chartrans case.  The
  trademark character (given by &#8482; or &trade;) will be shown as
  "(TM)" as the ASCII substitution unless the current display character
  has a code point for the trademark character or unless overridden by a
  chartrans translation table. The code of 1997-02-25 prevented showing
  the trademark sign as "(R)" but did not work in all non-chartrans
  cases. - KW
* Include time.h via tcp.h for SVR4 systems.  The tcp.h header does include
  sys/time.h for Unix systems, but this apparently doesn't get  struct tm 
  and  extern char * ctime()  declared for SVR4. - FM
1997-03-13
* Added protection in LYGetFile.c against connections to the port 25
  ESMTP service. - FM
1997-03-12
* (chartrans) Make compilation in src/chrtrans less verbose, no more 
  generating automatic *.h_old backup copies. - KW
* Refinement to the SVr4 (ncurses) color support, allowing it
  to more closely model the slang support. - TD
1997-03-11
* Tweak for command line parsing of files with no URL in LYUtils.c.
  Also added ability to pass partial domain names in the DJGPP version. - WB
* Added the closing function for Win32 TCP in LYExit.c (did anyone see a
  difference?!). - WB
* Altered LYCurses.c so that the DJGPP version could spawn other programs
  without certain death. - WB
* Ignoring the whole ~/lynx.cfg problem (expanding '~') entirely for the 
  Win32 version for now. - WB
* Some other tweaks for Win32 and DJGPP - WB
* Added protection in LYGetFile.c against denial of service attacks via
  the port 19 CHARGEN service.  The distributed code left Lynx or proxies
  vulnerable to such attacks via direct or redirection URLs. - FM
1997-03-10
* Fixed error in the handling of numeric character references with values
  greater than 255 in SGML.c.  The distributed code was breaking after
  substitutions instead of falling through to reset the string chunk and
  recycle the terminator if not a semi-colon. - FM
1997-03-09
* Integrated (simple) color, auto-configure patches with 2.7 following
  chrtrans patch - T.Dickey, J.Spath.
1997-03-08
* Fixed error in the switch positioning of checks for XLOADIMAGE_COMMAND
  and wais_proxy in LYReadCFG.c.  The distributed code had them reversed
  under case 'W' versus case 'X'. - PDS
* Expanded the copyright and licensing statements in the -version
  output. - FM
1997-03-04
* Corrected the offset computation in textsearch() of LYSearch.c so that
  WHEREIS searches repeated on a page with no links seek the target
  starting at the line immediately following the last displayed.  The
  distributed code was setting a greater offset. - JS
1997-03-02
* Don't entify post content for the showinfo display, now that we are
  making it an XMP block in that display to handle all of the supported
  enctypes. - FM
* Patches to fix mail and FTP for Win32 (LYMail.c, HTFile.c). - WB
* Makefiles to compile chartrans code for Win32. - WB
* (chartrans) Minor cleanups (makeuctb.c, chrtrans/Makefile, HTPlain.c)
  to enable successful compilation on Win32. - KW
1997-02-28
* Changed all references to "image/*" to just "image" in the userdefs.h
  and lynx.cfg comments about XLOADIMAGE_COMMAND.  The "/*" within the
  userdefs.h comments was generating warnings from some compilers. - FM
* Added a snake-slang target to the Makefile, and added -DUNIX to the
  LYFLAGS for the snake3 and snake3-slang targets (HP-UX apparently does
  not define "unix" itself with the -Ae switch, and thus needs to have
  that definition forced via -DUNIX). - HL
* Merged with patches and makefiles from Wayne Buttles 
  (buttles@wsb.champlain.edu) to enable compilation in two new environments: 
  Win32 (95/NT) with Borland C++ 4.52 compiler, and 386 DOS with DJGPP 
  compiler.  To add ports for Win32 (95/NT) and 386 DOS computers with a
  packet driver, four new defines were created: _WINDOWS (Defined for Win32
  specific code - Mostly TCP related), DJGPP (Defined for 386 specific code -
  Mostly TCP related), DOSPATH (Defined for any DOS'ish computer), and
  NOSIGHUP (Defined for computers not supporting sighup signal calls).
  Separate utility programs needed for compiling and running Lynx on those
  platforms are available from Wayne at
  <http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/wlynx/>. - WB, KW
* Fixed Telnet for Win32 - WB
* (chartrans) Small correction in SGML.c (set_chartrans_handling) - KW
1997-02-26
* Close both descriptors of the pipe() for the NSL_FORK enabled code
  in HTTCP.c.  The distributed code was closing only one of them on
  completed gethostbyname() calls, and neither on 'z'aps. - FM
* Changed the HREF for the "Lynx FAQ" link in the online 'h'elp to
  its new URL (http://www.slcc.edu/lynx/faq.html). - FM
1997-02-25
* More reverse engineering to cope with Netscape's bogus cookie header
  parsing.  The parser must not require an '=' between the expires
  attribute name and value, because Set-Cookie headers are being
  transmitted without it (e.g., by http://law.agps.gov.au).  So Lynx
  now treats that as another special case. - FM
* Cope with invalid use of expires attributes in Version 1 cookies.
  An -06 State Management draft recommends that for "backward
  compatibility", and has been severely criticized in the HTTP-WG,
  but it would be foolish not to assume Netscape will do that.  See the
  expanded comments in LYSetCookie() of LYCookie.c for more information.
  Note that "expires" thus cannot be used as a Version 1 cookie name, but
  a provider would be foolish to use that, anyway.  Note also that the
  possibility of using different header names for Version 1 versus
  Version 0 (a.k.a., "Netscape") cookies is being discussed in the
  HTTP-WG, which might have been better to do in the first place, but
  the -05 draft has been approved as RFC 2109:
    http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc2109.txt
  so it would be a while before that were done, if ever. - FM
* chartrans code for translation of character sets, handling of Unicode,
  and i18n updated for Lynx 2.7.  Support for CHARSET attribute on A
  tags.  New directory src/chrtrans with table files.  Compilation flags
  -DEXP_CHARTRANS, -DEXP_CHARTRANS_AUTOSWITCH (for Linux), 
  -DSLANG_MBCS_HACK (for raw unicode console).  
  New command line options when compiled with -DEXP_CHARTRANS: 
  -assume_charset, -assume_local_charset, -assume_unrec_charset.  
  See README.chartrans and README files in src/chrtrans for more info.
  INFO screen shows of effective charset even if not given explicitly.
  Translation routines in LYCharUtils.c not chartrans-ified at this point.
  - KW
* No showing of &trade; or &#8482; as (R) any more, use (TM) instead. - KW
* Prefer HTTP-EQUIV over NAME in META tags. - KW
1997-02-22
* Fixed a memory management glitch which could cause a crash if the
  MIME type of a reply to a FORM submission with METHOD=POST caused a
  download offer to be invoked. - FM
* Don't simplify ftp URLs by trimming trailing slashes if the URL is
  being proxied.  The Netscape proxy server for some unknown reason
  can return redirection for ftp URLs with the slash appended, and
  trimming it can result in a redirection loop.  Based on a posted
  patch from KW. - FM
* Fixed two typos in the checks for HTPassHighCtrlRaw in LYExpandString()
  of LYCharUtils.c. - KW
* Fixed typo in the equality check on line 1553 in HTGopher.c. - AM
1997-02-19
* Reset the host string after an '@', if present, when trimming default
  ":port" fields in the new code aimed at compliance with the Masinter
  and Fielding URL drafts, expected to replace RFCs 1738 and 1808.  The
  distributed code neglected to do that, and was ending up on a ":password"
  field, if present, instead of on the ":port" field, causing the username
  to be treated as the host name.  - FM
* Expand the default port trimming so as to include all of the registered
  URL schemes which support a port field in the v2.7 release. - FM
* Correctly uncache the current directory listing when invoking an 'u'pload,
  so that it will be updated to include the uploaded file if placed in the
  current directory.  The released code attempted to do this in a manner
  which prevented a pop, so that the directory listing couldn't be restored
  on return from the uploader menu. - FM
* Recognize a bookmark file used as the startfile, whether it resides in the
  home directory or in a subdirectory off home.  The released code failed if
  the file was in home, and not in a subdirectory, unless the -book switch
  was used instead of a startfile entry or WWW_HOME variable. - FM
