<h1>+++DEFAULT BINDING+++</h1>

Lynx invokes a built-in <em>Line Editor</em> for entering strings in
response to prompts, in forms, and for email messages if an external editor
has not been defined.  Alternative key bindings can be offered
by configuring with --enable-alt-bindings or by adding them in LYEditmap.c
before compiling Lynx.  If available, they may
be selected via the 'o'ptions menu, or by editing lineedit_mode in the
'.lynxrc' file.

<p>Two such alternative key bindings, which may be available on your system,
are the <A HREF="alt_edit_help.html">Alternative Binding</A> keymap and the
<A HREF="bashlike_edit_help.html">Bash-like Binding</A> keymap.

<p>Note: setting emacs/vi keys ON has no effect on line-editor bindings.

<p>This is the <em>Default Binding</em> keymap:

     cursor.
