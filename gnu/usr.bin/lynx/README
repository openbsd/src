Lynx Version 2.8 is the latest "official" release.  This release is based on
the lynx2.7.1ac-0.118 development code set, and includes bug fixes through
March 8, 1998.  See the CHANGES2.8 file in the docs subdirectory for a complete
record of all changes and bug fixes in this release.  New releases are
announced on the lynx-dev mailing list (see below).


WHAT IS LYNX?

   Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
   cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices such as vt100
   terminals, vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any other
   character-cell display. It will display Hypertext Markup Language
   (HTML) documents containing links to files on the local system, as
   well as files on remote systems running http, gopher, ftp, wais, nntp,
   finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and services accessible via logins to
   telnet, tn3270 or rlogin accounts.  Current versions of Lynx run on
   Unix, VMS, Windows95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.

   Lynx can be used to access information on the WWW, or to establish
   information systems intended primarily for local access. Lynx has been
   used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  Lynx can
   also be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.

   Lynx is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) without
   restrictions on usage or redistribution.  The Lynx copyright statement,
   "COPYHEADER", and GNU GPL, "COPYING", are included in the top-level
   directory of the distribution.  Lynx is supported by the Lynx user
   community, an entirely volunteer (and unofficial) organization.

   Certain portions of the Lynx source distribution were originally
   created by CERN and have been modified during the development of
   Lynx.  See WWW/Copyright.txt for copyright info regarding CERN
   products used in Lynx.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

   We believe Lynx works properly for the Year 2000 issues, since it does
   not store dates in 2-digit form.  Since it must communicate with a wide
   range of web servers, it interprets dates in a variety of formats.  In
   particular, if Lynx receives a date with a 2-digit year, it assumes that
   values less than 70 are in the range 2000-2069.

DOCUMENTATION

   A users guide is included in this distribution along with a man page
   for Unix systems and a help file for VMS systems. All documentation is
   contained in the top directory and the docs, samples and lynx_help
   subdirectories.

   While running Lynx, type 'h', 'H', or '?' to invoke the help menu
   system. From the help menu you may access several useful documents
   pertaining to Lynx and the World Wide Web. The most important of
   these is the Lynx Users Guide. By default, Lynx will use the Lynx
   Enhanced Pages, which includes http links for help and FAQs concerning
   Lynx. It is recommended that you install your own help menu system at
   your site in order to lessen the load on http servers. This also will
   allow you to customize the help menu system for your site and greatly
   speed up access for those using Lynx over a slow connection.

   For Unix and related systems which support the autoconf configure script,
   the help menu system is installed by the "make install-help" command.

   For other systems (such as VMS), copy COPYHEADER and COPYING into the
   lynx_help/ subdirectory.  Then copy the lynx_help subdirectory to a public
   place on your system, or into your $HOME directory if you are a single
   user.  Finally, edit the lynx.cfg file  so that the HELPFILE line is
   defined as follows:

      HELPFILE:file://localhost/[public_path]/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html

   where [public_path] is the absolute path to the lynx_help directory.
   Customizing the help menu system is just a matter of editing a set of
   HTML files.  Additional information about installing and customizing
   the help file set is available at <URL:http://www.irm.nara.kindai.ac.jp/
   lynxdev/README.help>.
