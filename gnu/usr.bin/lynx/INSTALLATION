                      Lynx Installation Guide

This file describes how to compile and install Lynx.  A description of
Lynx can be found in the README file.  Lynx has been ported to UN*X, VMS,
Win32 and 386DOS.  The procedures for compiling these ports are quite
divergent, and are detailed respectively in Sections II, III, IV and V.

First, however, you must configure Lynx for your system regardless of the
port you will be using.  Follow the instructions given immediately below to
configure for your system, and then go to the respective section concerning
the port you wish to compile.  General installation, problem solving, and
environment variables are covered in Sections VI and VII.


I. General configuration instructions (all ports).

Step 1. (define compile-time variables -- See the userdefs.h file.)
    There are a few variables that MUST be defined, or Lynx will not build.
    There are a few more that you will probably want to change.  The variables
    that must be changed are marked as such in the userdefs.h file.  Just edit
    this file, and the changes should be straight forward.  Many of the
    variables in "userdefs.h" are now configurable in the lynx.cfg file, so
    you may set them at run-time if you wish.  If you compile using auto-
    configure, you would not absolutely need to edit "userdefs.h".  Check
    LYMessages_en.h for tailoring the Lynx statusline prompts, messages and
    warnings to the requirements of your site.  The strings in LYMessages_en.h
    may be translated into a language of your choice.  If you rename the file,
    be sure to change the definition in "userdefs.h".

Step 2. (define run-time variables -- See the lynx.cfg file for details.)
    Set up local printers, downloaders, assumed character set, key mapping,
    and colors in the lynx.cfg file.  Please read "lynx.cfg" thoroughly as
    many of the features of Lynx, and how to use them, are explained.  Also
    see the example mime.types, mailcap and jumps files in the samples
    subdirectory.  Lynx must be able to find the lynx.cfg file at start-up.
    The location of the lynx.cfg file may be compiled in with the LYNX_CFG_FILE
    defined in userdefs.h (or with the configure option explained in the Unix
    section below), specified with an environment variable, LYNX_CFG, or
    specified with the "-cfg" command line option.

Step 3. (You may skip this step if you only use English and are not
    interested in any special characters, or if your display and local files
    will all use the ISO-8859-1 "ISO Latin 1" Western European character set.)
    People who will be running Lynx in an environment with different and
    incompatible character sets should configure CHARACTER_SET (the Display
    character set) and ASSUME_LOCAL_CHARSET to work correctly for them before
    creating bookmark files et cetera.  Please read "lynx.cfg" for detailed
    instructions.  Additional character sets and their properties may be
    defined with tables in the src/chrtrans directory, see the README.* files
    therein.

Step 4. (optional -- news for UNIX and VMS)
    Set NNTPSERVER in "lynx.cfg" to your site's NNTP server, or set the
    environment variable externally.  (See "VII. Setting environment
    variables before running Lynx" for help on setting this and other
    environment variables which affect Lynx.)  For news posting ability
    to be enabled in Lynx, in userdefs.h (and optionally in lynx.cfg) the
    NEWS_POSTING symbol must be defined to TRUE.  Also define LYNX_SIG_FILE
    in userdefs.h or lynx.cfg so that it points to users' signature files
    for appending to posted messages.

Step 5. (optional -- UNIX only)
    To add direct WAIS support, get the freeWAIS distribution from
    "ftp://ftp.cnidr.org/pub/NIDR.tools/freewais", and compile it.  The compile
    process will create the libraries you will need, wais.a and client.a.  Edit
    the Makefile in the top level directory and add the library locations under
    the DIRECT WAIS ACCESS heading.  Edit the Makefile for the WWW Library in
    "WWW/Library/Implementation/CommonMakefile" to point to the include
    directory for the freewais distribution.  Precompiled libraries are
    available for many platforms if you don't wish to compile one yourself.

Step 6. (Anonymous account -- VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! -- )
    If you are building Lynx for your personal use only you may skip this
    step. If you are setting up an anonymous account with Lynx, you are
    STRONGLY advised to use the -anonymous command line option.  If you do
    not use this option, users may be able to gain access to all readable
    files on your machine!  ALSO NOTE that many implementations of telnetd
    allow passing of environment variables, which might be used by
    unscrupulous people to modify the environment in anonymous accounts.
    When making Lynx and Web access publicly available via anonymous
    accounts intended to run Lynx captively, be sure the wrapper uses the
    -cfg switch to specify the startfile, rather than relying on the
    LYNX_CFG, LYNX_CFG_FILE, or WWW_HOME variables.


II. Compile instructions -- UNIX

1a. Auto-configure.  The auto-configure script uses autoconf2.12 to generate a
    Bourne shell script, configure, which creates "makefile" and "lynx_cfg.h".

    If you are on a UNIX platform, the easiest way to build Lynx is to type:

	    ./configure
    and
	    make

    NOTE:  Configure has a number of useful options.  Please see below.

    NOTE:  The 'configure' script generates auxiliary files "config.status"
    "config.cache" and "config.log".  Normally you will not notice these;
    they are created automatically and removed by a "make distclean".
    
	+ If you wish to rebuild Lynx with a new host, or change ANY of the
	  parameters which are stored in config.cache, you MUST first remove
	  the config.cache file before running configure; its options do NOT
	  override the settings in that file.
    
	+ The config.status file is a script which creates (or regenerates)
	  the files created by the configure script.

    Please report problems in the configure/make process by including a copy
    of config.status, config.cache and config.log, as well as the pertinent
    compiler diagnostics.

    NOTE:  Lynx is a curses-based application, so you must have a curses
    library available to link to.  Native curses (on the system when it was
    installed) are often broken, so you may get superior performance if you
    have either "ncurses" ("ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/dickey/ncurses") or "slang"
    ("ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang").  If you install these libraries
    in your home directory or a non-default location, you may need to set the
    CPPFLAGS (full path to include files) and LIBS (full path to library files)
    environment variables BEFORE running configure.  See "1d. Environment".
    Use the "--with-screen=ncurses" or "--with-screen=slang" option.

1b. Platforms.  Configure should work properly on any Unix-style system.
    It has been tested on the following platforms.

	AIX 3.2.5 (cc w/ curses)	CLIX (cc w/ curses & ncurses)
	DGUX
	Digital Unix 3.2C and 4.0 (gcc & cc w/ curses, ncurses & slang)
	FreeBSD 2.1.5 (gcc 2.6.3 w/ curses & ncurses)
	HP-UX (K&R and ANSI cc, gcc w/ curses, ncurses & slang)
	IRIX 5.2 and 6.2 (cc & gcc w/ curses, ncurses & slang)
	Linux 2.0.0 (gcc 2.7.2 w/ curses, ncurses & slang)
	MkLinux 2.1.5 (gcc 2.7.2.1)	NetBSD
	OS/2 EMX 0.9b			SCO (cc w/ curses)
	Solaris 2.5 & 2.6 (cc & gcc w/ curses, ncurses & slang)
	SunOS 4.1 (cc w/ curses, gcc w/ ncurses & slang)

    NOTE:  SunOS and HP-UX come with a bundled K&R compiler, which is only
    useful for compiling with the bundled curses.  Both ncurses and slang
    require a compiler that recognizes prototypes.

1c. Options
    To get a list of the configure script's options, type "./configure --help".
    Below is an alphabetical listing of the Lynx-specific options.  The actual
    order shown by the -help option is different.  See "docs/README.defines"
    for information on defines for which there are no option switches.

  --disable-dired			(defines DIRED_SUPPORT)
	Use this option to disable the optional directory-editor.

	Lynx supports directory editing (DirEd) for local directories.
	This allows users to do things like view, copy and remove files
	using a tabular display of the directory and single-keystroke
	commands instead of using the command line.  From inside Lynx, the
	keystroke sequence "g.<enter>" switches Lynx to DirEd mode on the
	current directory.  If you're building a Lynx that is to be used as
	a kind of restricted shell for users who do not have access to the
	command line and should not have access to equivalent capabilities,
	you must disable DirEd with this option.  You can also disable some
	DirEd functions while allowing others.  If you have disabled DirEd
	completely, you can ignore all the other DirEd options.

	All DirEd functions that were enabled on compilation can be disabled
	or modified at run time via DIRED_MENU symbols in lynx.cfg.

  --disable-dired-archive		(define ARCHIVE_ONLY)
	Use this option to prevent DirEd from extracting files from an
	archive file.

  --disable-dired-gzip			(prevent defining OK_GZIP)
	Use this option to prevent DirEd from using gzip and gunzip.

  --disable-dired-override		(prevent defining OK_OVERRIDE)
	Lynx users can customize their keymaps by creating private
	versions of lynx.cfg and modifying them to override the default
	keymap.  Use this option to prevent DirEd keymap overriding.

  --disable-dired-permit		(prevent defining OK_PERMIT)
	Use this option to prevent DirEd from changing the permissions
	on directories or files (i.e., from doing what the Unix chmod
	command or the DOS attrib command does).

  --disable-dired-tar			(prevent defining OK_TAR)
	Use this option to prevent DirEd from using the tar program.

  --disable-dired-uudecode		(prevent defining OK_UUDECODE)
	Use this option to prevent DirEd from using uudecode.

  --disable-dired-xpermit		(define NO_CHANGE_EXECUTE_PERMS)
	Use this option if you do not disable out the dired-permit
	option, but want to restrict changes of the eXecute permission
	to directories (i.e., not allow it to be changed for files).  If
	you don't do this, you can still block changes of the eXecute
	permission for files but not directories via the
	"change_exec_perms" command line restriction.

  --disable-dired-zip			(prevent defining OK_ZIP)
	Use this option to prevent DirEd from using zip and unzip.

  --disable-echo
  	Use this option to suppress the "compiling" commands during a build.
	Doing this makes it easier to find and read warning messages.

  --disable-extended-dtd		(define NO_EXTENDED_HTMLDTD)
	disable extended HTML DTD logic.  This should revert to old-style
	(2.7.1/2.7.2) behavior, but is not well-tested.

  --disable-full-paths
  	Use this option to control whether full utility pathnames are used.
	By default, configure substitutes full pathnames.

  --disable-long-list			(prevent defining LONG_LIST)
  	Use this option to disable long "ls -l" directory listings.

  --disable-parent-dir-refs		(define NO_PARENT_DIR_REFERENCE)
  	Use this option to disable "Up-to" parent-links in directory listings.

  --enable-8bit-toupper			(define EXP_8BIT_TOUPPER)
	use experimental 8-bit case-conversion, e.g., for case-insensitive
	searches in non-ASCII character set.

  --enable-color-style			(define USE_COLOR_STYLE)
  	Use this option to enable optional and *experimental* color style.
	(Also defines USE_HASH, LINKEDSTYLES)

  --enable-debug			(The symbol DEBUG is always defined.)
  	Use this option to compile-in support for debugging.

  --enable-default-colors		(define USE_DEFAULT_COLORS)
  	enable use of default-color background (ncurses/slang).  Either
	configuration supports the use of 'default' for colors even without
	this option.

  --enable-externs			(define USE_EXTERNALS)
	Use this option to enable external application support. (See lynx.cfg.)

  --enable-find-leaks			(define LY_FIND_LEAKS)
	Use this option to compile-in logic for testing memory leaks.

  --enable-font-switch			(define EXP_CHARTRANS_AUTOSWITCH)
	Allow Lynx to automatically change the Linux console state (switch
	fonts) according to the current Display Character Set.  (Linux console
        only.  *Use with discretion.*  See docs/README.chartrans.)

  --enable-internal-links		(define DONT_TRACK_INTERNAL_LINKS)
	Disabled by default, this option allows tracking of internal links,
	a feature which could, however, compromise a secure transaction by
	forcing inappropriate resubmission of form content.

  --enable-nsl-fork			(define NSL_FORK)
	Use this option to allow NSL requests to be aborted at will.

  --enable-underlines			(define UNDERLINE_LINKS)
	Use this option underline links rather than using boldface.

  --enable-warnings
	Use this option to turn on GCC compiler warnings.

  --libdir				(affect LYNX_CFG_FILE)
	Defines the location where you want the lynx.cfg file installed.
	The configure script defines the symbol LYNX_CFG_FILE to correspond
	with the $libdir environment variable.  (For platforms which do not
	support a configure script, such as MS-DOS, Win32 and VMS, you must
	edit userdefs.h if you wish to specify the location of lynx.cfg).

  --with-screen=XXX
	Use this option to select the screen type.  The option value,
	XXX must be one of curses (the default), ncurses or slang.
	Specifying a screen type causes the configure script to look in
	standard locations for the associated header and library files,
	unless you have preset the $CFLAGS and $LIBS variables.

	--with-screen=ncurses		(define NCURSES)
	--with-screen=slang		(define USE_SLANG)

   --with-zlib				(define USE_ZLIB)
	Use zlib for decompression of some gzip files.

1d. Environment variables
    The configure script looks for programs and libraries in known/standard
    locations.  You can override the behavior of the script by presetting
    environment variables.  If they are set, the script will try to use these
    values rather than computing new ones.  Useful variables include:

	CC - the C compiler.  If you do not override this, configure
		will try to use gcc.

	CFLAGS - the C compiler options.  These also include C
		preprocessor options (such as -I), since the $CFLAGS and
		$CPPFLAGS variables are maintained separately.

	CPPFLAGS - the C preprocessor options.  For some configuration
		tests, you may need to set both $CFLAGS and $CPPFLAGS if
		you are compiling against header files in nonstandard
		locations.

	LDFLAGS - linker/loader options.

	LIBS - the libraries to be linked, with -L and -l options.  If
		you are linking against libraries in nonstandard locations
		unrelated to the install prefix (that you can specify in
		the configure script) you may have to specify these via
		the $LIBS variable.

-- 1997/7/27 - T. Dickey <dickey@clark.net>

1e. Examples
    If you are compiling Lynx for your personal use and are restricted to your
    home directory, a simple method for building would be to choose some
    directory, say ".lynx", and then type:

	./configure --prefix=~/.lynx --exec-prefix=~/.lynx
    and
	make install

    Now you only need to add "~/.lynx/bin" to your PATH and edit "~/.lynx/lib/
    lynx.cfg" as described above.

    I personally use the following csh shell script to set environment
    variables and configure options rather than type them each time.
	setenv RESOLVLIB -lbind

	#!/bin/csh -f
	setenv CPPFLAGS "-SYSLOG_REQUESTED_URLS -I$HOME/slang \
		-I$HOME/.usr/include"
	setenv LIBS "-L$HOME/.slang/lib -L$HOME/.usr/lib"
	./configure --exec-prefix=$HOME --bindir=$HOME/.lynx \
		--mandir=$HOME/.usr/man --libdir=$HOME/.usr/lib \
		--with-screen=slang --with-zlib

    The syntax for setting environment variables depends upon your shell.  I
    use the libbind.a resolver library, not libresolv.a.  Setting RESOLVLIB to
    -lbind defines this environment variable for `make', and thus must be set
    in the same shell that `make' will be run.  CPPFLAGS in this example
    predefines SYSLOG_REQUESTED_URLS for the configure script, since it is not
    defined by default, and has no option switch (see "docs/README.defines").
    CPPFLAGS also defines the full path to the slang and zlib header files,
    which are not kept in standard directories.  Likewise, LIBS defines the
    nonstandard locations of libslang.a and libz.a.  Setting the option
    --bindir tells the configure script where I want to install the lynx
    binary; setting --mandir tells it where to put the lynx.1 man page, and
    setting --libdir tells it (while at the same time defining LYNX_CFG_FILE)
    where to put the configuration file "lynx.cfg", when I type "make install".
    The --with-screen=slang and --with-zlib options are explained above.

2. Manual compile
    If auto-configure does not work for you, or you prefer to compile
    Lynx manually, "docs/Makefile.old" will serve as a template for the
    top-level Makefile, and instructions on how to compile are given in
    "docs/INSTALLATION.old".


III. Compile instructions -- VMS

Step 1.  Downloading binary files.
    Lynx must handle all IO as streams, and on VMS, output files are always
    created with Stream_LF format via the C RTL's fopen().  The file headers
    indicate Implied Carriage Control, even when the transfer was in binary
    mode, which can confuse downloading software and cause corruption of
    the file contents.  To deal with this, you should define the symbol
    USE_FIXED_RECORDS as TRUE in userdefs.h and/or lynx.cfg.  This will
    instruct Lynx to correct the header information to indicate FIXED 512
    records, with No Implied Carriage Control.  If Lynx fails to do the
    conversion (because the file wasn't mapped to a binary MIME type) you can
    execute FIXED512.COM externally to correct the header information.  The
    command file uses Joe Meadow's FILE utility, or the SET FILE/ATTRIBUTES
    command on current versions of VMS, to modify the headers.  See the
    comments in FIXED512.COM, userdefs.h and lynx.cfg for more information.

Step 2.  Passive FTP
    If your system requires the PASV FTP code instead of the standard
    PORT FTP code (e.g., to deal with a firewall) then edit "WWW/Library/
    Implementation/HTFTP.c" and comment out line 43 like so:
             /*  #define LISTEN   /* @@@@ Test LJM */.

Step 3a.
    Lynx uses the VMS port of gzip for uncompressing streams which have
    Content-Encoding headers indicated compression with gzip or the
    Unix compress.  If you do not have gzip installed on your system
    you can get it from "ftp://ftp.wku.edu/" in the fileserv directory.
    The command Lynx uses to uncompress on VMS is "gzip -d".

    If you are using the SOCKETSHR library, read SOCKETSHR.announce and
    make sure you have defined SOCKETSHR and SOCKETSHR_LIBRARY as explained
    therein.

    A "build.com" and "build-slang.com" script for building Lynx with curses
    or slang is in the top level directory.  All you have to do is type
    "@build" or "@build-slang" and answer its prompt for your system's TCP-IP
    software.  Current choices are:
           MULTINET (default)
	   UCX
	   WIN_TCP
           CMU_TCP
	   SOCKETSHR_TCP
	   TCPWARE
    It will autosense whether you have VAXC, DECC or GNUC on VAX or AXP and
    build appropriately.  If a WWWLib already exists for that TCP-IP software,
    it will prompt you for whether you want to rebuild it.  If you want to
    build a WWWLib separately, you can type "@libmake.com" with your default
    directory set to [.WWW.Library.vms] instead doing it via "build.com" in
    the top directory.  You may need to modify "build-slang.com", as described
    in its header, so that it can find slang.olb on your system.  If you have
    both DECC and VAXC, it will use DECC to benefit from the newer and more
    efficient memory management functions.

Step 3b.  (optional compilation method)
    If you have and want to use MMS, read the header of descrip.mms in the
    top directory and be sure you include the appropriate macro definitions
    when you invoke it:

	$ MMS /Macro = (MULTINET=1)		for VAXC - MultiNet
	$ MMS /Macro = (WIN_TCP=1)		for VAXC - Wollongong TCP/IP
	$ MMS /Macro = (UCX=1)			for VAXC - UCX
	$ MMS /Macro = (CMU_TCP=1)		for VAXC - OpenCMU TCP/IP
	$ MMS /Macro = (SOCKETSHR_TCP=1)	for VAXC - SOCKETSHR/NETLIB
	$ MMS /Macro = (TCPWARE=1)		for VAXC - TCPWare TCP/IP

	$ MMS /Macro = (MULTINET=1, DEC_C=1)	for DECC - MultiNet
	$ MMS /Macro = (WIN_TCP=1, DEC_C=1)	for DECC - Wollongong TCP/IP
	$ MMS /Macro = (UCX=1, DEC_C=1)		for DECC - UCX
	$ MMS /Macro = (CMU_TCP=1, DEC_C=1)	for DECC - OpenCMU TCP/IP
	$ MMS /Macro = (SOCKETSHR_TCP=1,DEC_C=1) for DECC - SOCKETSHR/NETLIB
	$ MMS /Macro = (TCPWARE=1, DEC_C=1)	for DECC - TCPWare TCP/IP

	$ MMS /Macro = (MULTINET=1, GNU_C=1)	for GNUC - MultiNet
	$ MMS /Macro = (WIN_TCP=1, GNU_C=1)	for GNUC - Wollongong TCP/IP
	$ MMS /Macro = (UCX=1, GNU_C=1)		for GNUC - UCX
	$ MMS /Macro = (CMU_TCP=1, GNU_C=1)	for GNUC - OpenCMU TCP/IP
	$ MMS /Macro = (SOCKETSHR_TCP=1,GNU_C=1) for GNUC - SOCKETSHR/NETLIB
	$ MMS /Macro = (TCPWARE=1, GNU_C=1)	for GNUC - TCPWare TCP/IP

    If you just type "MMS" it will default to the MULTINET and VAXC
    configuration.  MMS will build the WWW library and Lynx sources, and
    link the executable.  However, not all of the header dependencies are
    specified.  If you are not a developer, and need a clean build, you
    should use build.com instead of the MMS utility.

    If you want SOCKS support on VMS, you must add SOCKS as a compilation
    definition, and the SOCKS library to the link command.  However, instead
    of SOCKSifying Lynx for use behind a firewall, you are better off if you
    build Lynx normally, and set up Lynx to use a proxy server (see below).
    You instead can SOCKSify the proxy server, and it will handle all clients,
    not just Lynx.


IV. Compile instructions -- Win32 (Windows95/NT)

    The original Win32 port was built with Borland C++ 4.52, but later
    versions reportedly can be used.  Before compiling the Lynx sources, you
    need a curses library, and it is recommended that you have the zlib
    library.  Get pdcurses2.3 from "http://www.lightlink.com/hessling/".  I
    have modified it so that mouse support is no longer broken for Lynx (see
    "http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/").  You will want to get zlib from
    "http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/".  Compile these libraries, and
    put them in a convenient place (pdcurses inside the Lynx directory).

    Unpack the latest Lynx source distribution, and make an obj directory
    under the source root to contain the compile output.  Copy in your
    IDE file.  A sample IDE file and helper libraries are available at
    "http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/wlynx/source/".

    First build the .h files in src\chrtrans using "MAKEW32.BAT".  Double
    check for new .tbl files; hand edit in any new ones, and then do "makew32".
    Jump into Borland C++, load the project (IDE file) and compile Lynx.
    Alternately, after compiling the chartrans tables, you can come back to
    the top directory and compile manually, i.e., do "make -f makefile.w32".

    I also have a binary available at "http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/".  This
    binary was compiled with pdcurses 2.3, hacked so win32 mouse support works,
    and with zlib, so Lynx can do gzip routines internally.  More hints and
    information can be found in "http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/lynxport.htm".

-- 1997/10/12 - W. Buttles <lynx-port@fdisk.com>

    It is possible to compile under the cygwin32 system, which will allow you
    to use the configure script described above for Unix.  Type, for example,
    "./configure --with-screen=slang --with-libz" in a Dos window running the
    cygwin bash$ shell.  You also have the choice of using either pdcurses or
    slang.  See "http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month1097/msg00559.html"
    and "http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month1097/msg00186.html", and other
    messages along those threads.  You will have to make a minor alteration to
    HTTCP.c (change delay to 30 seconds) and modify HTFILE.c (concerning
    getgroups).  You will need a launch program to call helper applications.


V. Compile instructions -- 386 DOS

    Compiling for DOS with DJGPP is a multistep procedure.  First install
    the c compiler and its libraries.  DJGPP, as distributed from the
    usual DJGPP archives, will not successfully compile lynx.  You need to
    "stubedit" your "cc1.exe" file.  The following parameters have worked
    successfully:  minstack=800k, bufsize=64k.  To accomplish this, move to
    the djgpp\bin directory and type the command:
        "stubedit cc1.exe bufsize=64k minstack=800k".
    Or do it interactively with the command: "stubedit cc1.exe".
    (see "http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month0897/msg00145.html").

    Unpack the source code using a DOS program like UNZIP386.  If you are
    using PKUNZIP to unpack the .zip archive, you must use the -d command
    line switch to restore the directory structure contained in the archive,
    i.e., do "pkunzip -d lynx-cur.zip".  No switch is required if you use
    unzip386 or unzip.  If you are trying to compile the 386DOS port under a
    Win95/NT DOS shell, be sure to unpack the source with a DOS program so
    that all directories will be adjusted to the DOS 8.3 file format necessary
    for compiling with DJGPP.  Do NOT use Winzip, because that will create
    long filenames that will not be recognized by DJGPP tools.

    If you wish to compile with "USE_ZLIB" (recommended), you must have the
    zlib library.  Get the source from "http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/"
    and compile it.  Put libz.a in the lib subdirectory of DJGPP, and put
    zlib.h and zconf.h in the include subdirectory.

    In addition to the files in the Lynx distribution, you will need a
    curses package and a TCP package.  You can use PDCurses (available at
    "http://www.lightlink.com/hessling/") and the DJGPP port of WATTCP
    (available in two different versions at "ftp://neonatal.sm.ic.ac.uk/"
    and in "http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/wlynx/source/djgpp.zip").
    You can also use slang ("ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang") as your
    curses library.  It has not been fully ported to DOS yet, however.
    See "http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month1097/msg00390.html".  You
    need to compile these before you go any further. If you wish to use the
    beta version of PDCurses 2.3, you need to first apply a patch (available at
    "http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month0997/msg00441.html").  If you have
    trouble applying the patch, we recommend that you use the "patch" program,
    ("http://www.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/pat25b.zip").  To
    read the Unix man style documentation, use, for example, "less"
    ("http://www.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/lss332b.zip").
    Compile or place your compiled PDCurses library in lynx2-*/curses, and
    compile or place your compiled WATTCP library in lynx2-*/djgpp/tcplib.

    Move to the "lynx2-*/WWW/Library/djgpp" directory and do "make".  This
    should compile libwww.a.  Next move to the "lynx2-*/src/chrtrans"
    directory and do "make -f makefile.dos" to compile the character tables.
    Then move to the "lynx2-*/src" directory and do "make -f makefile.dos".
    If all goes well, you will have a lynx.exe file.  If you have trouble,
    check to be sure djgpp.env is the way it came in the original package.

    To test Lynx_386 you must have a packet driver installed.  The simplest
    method is to use a null packet driver that just allows Lynx to start up,
    but doesn't do anything else.  One such executable driver has been posted,
    uuencoded, to the lynx-dev mailing list: "msg00031.html", "msg00057.html",
    and "msg00066.html" under "http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month0198/".
    Start the dummy packet driver with "nullpkt 0x60", and take it out of
    memory with "nullpkt -u".  You can also use slip8250.com.  See the CRYNWR
    package "http://www.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/pktdrvr/pktd11.zip".
    Usage is "slip8250 0x60", but you may have to invoke it as, for example,
    "slip8250  0x60 6 3 0x2F8" so that it uses COM2 and IRQ 3, in order to
    avoid an IRQ conflict with a mouse or some other device.  Another packet
    driver is slipper.exe, which is available from many sites, including
    "ftp://jazz.trumpet.com.au/slipper".  To remove it from memory use
    termin.com (usage "termin 0x60"), available in the CRYNWR package.  To
    connect over a dialup PPP connection you need dosppp or klos' pppshare.
    (Find at "http://www.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/pktdrvr/dosppp05.zip"
    and "ftp://ftp.klos.com/demo/pppshare.exe".)

    See "http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/lynxport.htm" for more hints and some
    precompiled libraries.  One problem you can run into is when editing
    userdefs.h and lynx.cfg, which have unix-style end of lines.  You would be
    well advised to use an editor that can handle end of lines terminated with
    a single LF character.  You can also unpack the source code using unzip386
    or unzip with the -a switch to convert unix LF to dos CRLF.  That will make
    texts more readable under DOS.  If you compile lynx regularly, you may
    automate the procedure by creating a batch file such as the following.

	cd djgpp\tcplib\obj
	make
	cd ..\..\www\library\djgpp
	make
	cd ..\..\..\src\chrtrans
	make -f makefile.dos
	cd ..\..\..\src
	make -f makefile.dos
	strip lynx.exe
	cd ..

    This batch file expects the DJGPP port of WATTCP to be installed in the
    lynx2-* directory.  Place a copy of this batch file, named "djgpp.bat",
    in the lynx2-* directory, move to that directory and type "djgpp".  A more
    complete batch file with error checking and annotation can be found at:
    "http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month1197/msg00250.html".

VI. General installation instructions

    Once you have compiled Lynx, test it out on "lynx_help/about_lynx.html".
    You shouldn't need to install Lynx to test it.  Once you are satisfied
    that it works, go ahead and install Lynx.  For Unix, type "make install".

    For VMS, you need to have the executable in a public place, make it
    accessible, define it as a foreign command, and copy lynx.cfg to
    "Lynx_Dir".  Look at lynx.com in the samples directory as a model for
    installing Lynx.  To include lynx.hlp in the system HELP library, use
    the command: "$ library/replace sys$help:helplib.hlb lynx.hlp".

    Local copies of the Lynx online help should be made accessible in response
    to the Lynx 'h'elp command by defining HELPFILE in userdefs.h and/or
    lynx.cfg to an appropriate file://localhost/path URL.  On Unix, all you
    need to do is type "make install-help."  If you are installing manually,
    copy the files "COPYHEADER" and "COPYING" into the lynx_help directory
    BEFORE moving the lynx_help tree to its final location.  These files are
    referenced hypertextually from help documents.  Find tips for installing
    the help files at "http://www.irm.nara.kindai.ac.jp/lynxdev/README.help".

    If you have old, pre-existing bookmark files from earlier versions of
    Lynx, those files may have to be updated.  Conversion may just consist
    of adding one META line near the top, or may require creating new book-
    mark files and editing in bookmarks from outdated files.

    IMPORTANT!  Be sure you have read the warnings about setting up an
    anonymous account with Lynx if you plan to give public access to Lynx.

    After applying patches or editing files to correct for an unsuccessful
    build, be certain to do a "make clean" (or "make distclean" for those
    using auto-configure) before attempting to compile again.

    If something doesn't work, or you can't get Lynx to even compile, or you
    don't understand what one of the defines means, read the PROBLEMS file,
    and the README.defines and *.announce files in the docs subdirectory.
    The docs/CHANGES* files record the entire development history of Lynx
    and are an invaluable resource for understanding how Lynx should perform.

    If you still have difficulties, send an email message to the Lynx-Dev
    mailing list (see the README file).  Try to include pertinent information
    about your system, the OS you are using, the name and version of your
    compiler, which curses library you are using and the compile-time errors.
    Be sure to say what version and image-number (alternately the top date
    of the CHANGES file) of Lynx you are trying to build.


VII. Setting environment variables before running Lynx (optional)

1. Unix and VMS
    To set your site's NTTP server as the default host for news reading
    and posting via Lynx, set the environment variable NNTPSERVER so that
    it points to its Internet address.  The variable "NNTPSERVER" is used
    to specify the host which will be used as the default for news URLs.

	UNIX
		setenv NNTPSERVER "news.server.dom"

	VMS
		define/system NNTPSERVER "news.server.dom"

    The environment variables "ORGANIZATION" or "NEWS_ORGANIZATION", if set,
    will be used for the Organization: header in news postings.  (On Unix,
    Lynx also checks for an /etc/organization file.)

    The environment variable "LYNX_CFG", if set, will override the default
    location and name of the global configuration file (lynx.cfg) that was
    defined via the constant "LYNX_CFG_FILE" in userdefs.h.  See userdefs.h
    for more information.

    The environment variable "LYNX_TEMP_SPACE", if set, will override the
    default path prefix for temporary files that was defined via the constant
    "TEMP_SPACE" in userdefs.h.  See userdefs.h for more information.

    The environment variable "LYNX_SAVE_SPACE", if set, will override the
    default path prefix for files saved to disk that was defined via the
    constant "SAVE_SPACE" in lynx.cfg.  See lynx.cfg for more information.

    The variable "WWW_HOME", if set, will override the default startup
    URL specified in any of the configuration files.

    Lynx still supports use of gateway servers, with the servers specified
    via the variables "WWW_access_GATEWAY", where "access" is lower case
    and can be "http", "ftp", "gopher" or "wais".  Most of the gateway
    servers have been discontinued, but "http://www.w3.org:8001" is
    available for wais searches (note that you do not include a terminal
    '/' for gateways, but do for proxies; see below).

    Lynx version 2.2 and beyond supports the use of proxy servers that can
    act as firewall gateways and caching servers.  They are preferable to
    the older gateway servers.  Each protocol used by Lynx can be mapped
    separately using PROTOCOL_proxy environment variables of the form:

        UNIX
                setenv http_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv https_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv ftp_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv gopher_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv news_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv newspost_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv newsreply_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv snews_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv snewspost_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv snewsreply_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv nntp_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv wais_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv finger_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                setenv cso_proxy "http://some.server.dom:port/"

        VMS
                define "http_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "https_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "ftp_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "gopher_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "news_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "newspost_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "newsreply_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "snews_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "snewspost_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "snewsreply_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "nntp_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "wais_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "finger_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                define "cso_proxy" "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                (Encase *BOTH* strings in double-quotes to maintain
		 lower case for the PROTOCOL_proxy variable and for
		 the http access type; include /system if you want
		 proxying for all clients on your system.)

    If you wish to override the use of a proxy server for specific hosts or
    entire domains you may use the "no_proxy" environment variable. Here is
    an example use of "no_proxy":

        UNIX
                setenv no_proxy "host.domain.dom, domain1.dom, domain2"

        VMS
                define "no_proxy" "host.domain.dom, domain1.dom, domain2"

    You can include a port number in the no_proxy list to override use
    of a proxy server for the host accessed via that port, but not via
    other ports.  For example, if you use "host.domain.dom:119" and/or
    "host.domain.dom:210", then news (port 119) URLs and/or any wais
    (port 210) searches on that host would be excluded, but http, ftp,
    and gopher services (if normally proxied) would still be included,
    as would any news or wais services on other hosts.

    If you wish to override the use of a proxy server completely (i.e.,
    globally override any existing proxy variables), set the value of
    "no_proxy" to "*".

    Note that Lynx treats file URLs on the local host as requests for
    direct access to the file, and does not attempt ftp if that fails.
    It treats both ftp URLs and file URLs on remote hosts as ftp URLs,
    and does not attempt direct file access for either.  If ftp URLs are
    being proxied, file URLs on a remote host will be converted to ftp
    URLs before submission by Lynx to the proxy server, so no special
    procedure for inducing the proxy server to handle them is required.
    Other WWW clients may require that the http server's configuration
    file have "Map file:* ftp:*" in it to perform that conversion.

    The proxy and no_proxy variables also can be set at run time via
    lynx.cfg.

2. Win32 (95/NT) and 386 DOS (adapted from "readme.txt" by Wayne Buttles)

    HOME         Where to keep the bookmark file and personal config files.
    LYNX_CFG     The full path and filename for lynx.cfg
    TEMP or TMP  Bookmarks are kept here with no HOME.  Temp files here.
    TERM         Set TERM=vt100 to stop that annoying terminal type message.
    USER         Tells Lynx you are real instead of an anonymous user(?)

    386 version only:
    WATTCP.CFG   Where to find the wattcp.cfg file.
    (Depending on how you compiled libtcp.a, you may have to use WATCONF.)

    Define these in your batch file for running Lynx.  For example, if your
    application line is "D:\win32\lynx.bat", lynx.bat may look like:
	@ECHO OFF
	set home=d:\win32
	set temp=d:\tmp
	set lynx_cfg=d:\win32\lynx.cfg
	d:\win32\lynx.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 %5
