 * Routines that combine the two diffs together into one.  The
 * algorithm used follows:
 *
 *   File2 is shared in common between the two diffs.
 *   Diff02 is the diff between 0 and 2.
 *   Diff12 is the diff between 1 and 2.
 *
 *	1) Find the range for the first block in File2.
 *	    a) Take the lowest of the two ranges (in File2) in the two
 *	       current blocks (one from each diff) as being the low
 *	       water mark.  Assign the upper end of this block as
 *	       being the high water mark and move the current block up
 *	       one.  Mark the block just moved over as to be used.
 *	    b) Check the next block in the diff that the high water
 *	       mark is *not* from.
 *
 *	       *If* the high water mark is above
 *	       the low end of the range in that block,
 *
 *		   mark that block as to be used and move the current
 *		   block up.  Set the high water mark to the max of
 *		   the high end of this block and the current.  Repeat b.
 *
 *	 2) Find the corresponding ranges in File0 (from the blocks
 *	    in diff02; line per line outside of diffs) and in File1.
 *	    Create a diff3_block, reserving space as indicated by the ranges.
 *
 *	 3) Copy all of the pointers for file2 in.  At least for now,
 *	    do memcmp's between corresponding strings in the two diffs.
 *
 *	 4) Copy all of the pointers for file0 and 1 in.  Get what you
 *	    need from file2 (when there isn't a diff block, it's
 *	    identical to file2 within the range between diff blocks).
 *
 *	 5) If the diff blocks you used came from only one of the two
 *	    strings of diffs, then that file (i.e. the one other than
 *	    the common file in that diff) is the odd person out.  If you used
 *	    diff blocks from both sets, check to see if files 0 and 1 match:
 *
 *		Same number of lines?  If so, do a set of memcmp's (if a
 *	    memcmp matches; copy the pointer over; it'll be easier later
 *	    if you have to do any compares).  If they match, 0 & 1 are
 *	    the same.  If not, all three different.
 *
 *   Then you do it again, until you run out of blocks.
