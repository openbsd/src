1998-03-22  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* pubscc.h: Describe how SccGetCommandOptions works.

1998-03-10  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.txt: Update and clarify various minor points.

Tue Jan 27 12:54:05 1998  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.txt: Update bug-cvs address to gnu.org.

Thu Dec 11 22:17:45 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.txt: Add Access to list of development environments which
	implement SCC.

Wed Oct 29 11:45:20 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.txt: CVSwiz runs the command line CVS; it is not an
	independent implementation of the protocol.

Sun Oct 26 14:57:33 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.txt: Add section "OTHER INTERFACES".

Tue Oct 21 23:25:43 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.txt (TOOLS IMPLEMENTING THE SCC): Add comment about
	Powerbuilder versions.

Mon Sep  8 08:52:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.txt (TOOLS IMPLEMENTING THE SCC): Be a little more
	specific about Powersoft and CodeWright.

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add pubscc.h.  Thanks to Frederic Van
	Haren for pointing this out.

Tue Sep  2 13:39:17 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.txt (SPECIFICATIONS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS DESCRIBING THE
	SCC): New section.

Mon Aug  4 10:46:59 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* pubscc.h: Add comment listing new CodeWright 5.00c functions.
	Add comment about CodeWright calling SccQueryInfo without
	SCC_cap_QueryInfo set.  Thanks to Frederic Van Haren for
	pointing out these issues.

4 Aug 1997  Jim Kingdon

	Changes for Visual C++ 5.0:
	* SCC.dsp: New file.
	* .cvsignore: add SCC.dsw SCC.opt SCC.plg Release.

	* scc.c (SccGet): Replace #if 0'd code with a comment and
	adjust to avoid compiler warning.

Mon Aug  4 09:58:11 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* scc.c: Split out the interface declarations into a new file
	pubscc.h.  This should make it easier to handle multiple
	scc.c-equivalents.

Mon Jul 14 15:58:25 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* scc.c: Add many comments and defines to document additional
	aspects of the SCC API.

7 Jul 1997  Frederic Van Haren  <Frederic.Van.Haren@lhs.be>

	* scc.c (SccHistory): file_names is LPSTR * not LPSTR.

Mon Jul  7 16:45:16 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* scc.c (SccGetVersion): Change arguments from () to (void).
	Clarify context_arg.  Also document 'window' arg.

Sat Jul  5 13:01:51 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.txt: PowerJ and Power++ are also said to implement SCC.

21 Mar 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* scc.c (SccCheckout): Write to debuglog and return
	-11 instead of -14.  I though maybe that this may be
	related to the crashes I've been seeing, but those
	crashes persisted when I deinstalled the SCC DLL.

14 Mar 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* scc.c: Go back to using debuglog not outproc for
	most debugging messages.  Developer Studio tends to
	erase the outproc messages on an error.
	More playing around with projects.
	* README.txt: Describe results of this.  I am making
	grey (source controlled) file icons appear, which is
	exciting.

4 Mar 1997  Jim Kingdon

	Still some distance from being able to open a
	project, but that's what I'm playing with:
	* scc.c (SccOpenProject): Use outproc not debuglog
	for debugging messages.
	(SccGet): Add debugging messages.
	(SccAddFromScc): Implemented.
	(SccInitialize): Return AddFromScc in capabilities.
	* scc.c: Change out_proc to outproc for consistency.

2 Mar 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* scc.c: Add a bunch of things, to SccOpenProject,
	SccGetProjPath, and perhaps elsewhere.  The project
	stuff doesn't really work yet, but the outproc does.

27 Feb 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* scc.c (SCC_max_init_path, SCC_max_name): Added.
	(SccInitialize): Set and use more arguments.
	(SccUninitialize): Might want to check ferror here.
	(SccOpenProject): Print to debug log if we get here.

Thu Feb 27 19:02:50 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.txt (TOOLS IMPLEMENTING THE SCC): New section.

Wed Feb 26 22:55:43 1997  David H. Hovemeyer <Hovemeyer_D@mediasoft.net>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* scc.c (SccGetVersion): Return the version number of the SCC
	spec; we don't get to pick what to return here.
	* README.txt: Update with current status.

Sat Feb 15 15:19:41 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: New file.

	* README.txt: Clarify a little more what this stuff does (and more
	the point, does not) do.
