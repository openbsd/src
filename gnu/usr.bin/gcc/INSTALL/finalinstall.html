<h1 class="settitle">Installing GCC: Final installation</h1>
Now that GCC has been built (and optionally tested), you can install it with
<pre class="example">     cd <var>objdir</var>; make install
</pre>
   <p>We strongly recommend to install into a target directory where there is
no previous version of GCC present.

   <p>That step completes the installation of GCC; user level binaries can
be found in <var>prefix</var><span class="file">/bin</span> where <var>prefix</var> is the value you
specified with the <span class="option">--prefix</span> to configure (or <span class="file">/usr/local</span>
by default).  (If you specified <span class="option">--bindir</span>, that directory will
be used instead; otherwise, if you specified <span class="option">--exec-prefix</span>,
<var>exec-prefix</var><span class="file">/bin</span> will be used.)  Headers for the C++ and
Java libraries are installed in <var>prefix</var><span class="file">/include</span>; libraries
in <var>libdir</var> (normally <var>prefix</var><span class="file">/lib</span>); internal
parts of the compiler in <var>libdir</var><span class="file">/gcc-lib</span>; documentation in
info format in <var>infodir</var> (normally <var>prefix</var><span class="file">/info</span>).

   <p>When installing cross-compilers, GCC's executables
are not only installed into <var>bindir</var>, that
is, <var>exec-prefix</var><span class="file">/bin</span>, but additionally into
<var>exec-prefix</var><span class="file">/</span><var>target-alias</var><span class="file">/bin</span>, if that directory
exists.  Typically, such <dfn>tooldirs</dfn> hold target-specific
binutils, including assembler and linker.

   <p>Installation into a temporary staging area or into a <span class="command">chroot</span>
jail can be achieved with the command

<pre class="example">     make DESTDIR=<var>path-to-rootdir</var> install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>path-to-rootdir</var> is the absolute path of
a directory relative to which all installation paths will be
interpreted.  Note that the directory specified by <code>DESTDIR</code>
need not exist yet; it will be created if necessary.

   <p>There is a subtle point with tooldirs and <code>DESTDIR</code>:
If you relocate a cross-compiler installation with
e.g. <span class="samp">DESTDIR=</span><var>rootdir</var>, then the directory
<var>rootdir</var><span class="file">/</span><var>exec-prefix</var><span class="file">/</span><var>target-alias</var><span class="file">/bin</span> will
be filled with duplicated GCC executables only if it already exists,
it will not be created otherwise.  This is regarded as a feature,
not as a bug, because it gives slightly more control to the packagers
using the <code>DESTDIR</code> feature.

   <p>If you built a released version of GCC using <span class="samp">make bootstrap</span> then please
quickly review the build status page for your release, available from
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html</a>. 
If your system is not listed for the version of GCC that you built,
send a note to
<a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a> indicating
that you successfully built and installed GCC. 
Include the following information:

     <ul>
<li>Output from running <var>srcdir</var><span class="file">/config.guess</span>.  Do not send us
that file itself, just the one-line output from running it.

     <li>The output of <span class="samp">gcc -v</span> for your newly installed gcc. 
This tells us which version of GCC you built and the options you passed to
configure.

     <li>Whether you enabled all languages or a subset of them.  If you used a
full distribution then this information is part of the configure
options in the output of <span class="samp">gcc -v</span>, but if you downloaded the
&ldquo;core&rdquo; compiler plus additional front ends then it isn't apparent
which ones you built unless you tell us about it.

     <li>If the build was for GNU/Linux, also include:
          <ul>
<li>The distribution name and version (e.g., Red Hat 7.1 or Debian 2.2.3);
this information should be available from <span class="file">/etc/issue</span>.

          <li>The version of the Linux kernel, available from <span class="samp">uname --version</span>
or <span class="samp">uname -a</span>.

          <li>The version of glibc you used; for RPM-based systems like Red Hat,
Mandrake, and SuSE type <span class="samp">rpm -q glibc</span> to get the glibc version,
and on systems like Debian and Progeny use <span class="samp">dpkg -l libc6</span>. 
</ul>
     For other systems, you can include similar information if you think it is
relevant.

     <li>Any other information that you think would be useful to people building
GCC on the same configuration.  The new entry in the build status list
will include a link to the archived copy of your message. 
</ul>

   <p>We'd also like to know if the
<a href="specific.html">host/target specific installation notes</a>
didn't include your host/target information or if that information is
incomplete or out of date.  Send a note to
<a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a> telling us how the information should be changed.

   <p>If you find a bug, please report it following our
<a href="../bugs.html">bug reporting guidelines</a>.

   <p>If you want to print the GCC manuals, do <span class="samp">cd </span><var>objdir</var><span class="samp">; make
dvi</span>.  You will need to have <span class="command">texi2dvi</span> (version at least 4.2)
and TeX installed.  This creates a number of <span class="file">.dvi</span> files in
subdirectories of <var>objdir</var>; these may be converted for
printing with programs such as <span class="command">dvips</span>.  You can also
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/order.html">buy printed manuals from the Free Software Foundation</a>, though such manuals may not be for the most
recent version of GCC.
