This is a beta release of a completely rewritten binutils distribution.
(Rewritten since binutils 1.x, that is.)

The linker (ld) has been moved into a separate directory, which should be
../ld.  Linker-specific notes are in ../ld/README.

As of version 2.5, the assembler (as) is also included in this package, in
../gas.  Assembler-specific notes can be found in ../gas/README.

These programs have been tested on various architectures.
However, since this is a beta release taken directly from an
evolving source tree, there might be some problems.  In particular,
the programs have not been ported to as many machines as the
old binutils.  There are also features of the old versions
that are missing on the new programs.  We would appreciate
patches to make things run on other machines; especially welcome
are fixes for what used to work on the old programs!
(See ./TODO, as well a ../bfd/TODO and ../ld/TODO.)

Recent changes are in ./NEWS, ../ld/NEWS, and ../gas/NEWS.

Unpacking and Installation -- quick overview
==========================

In this release, the binary utilities, the linker, the generic GNU include
files, the BFD ("binary file description") library, gprof, and getopt all
have directories of their own underneath the binutils-2.5 directory.
The idea is that a variety of GNU tools can
share a common copy of these things.  Configuration scripts and
makefiles exist to cruise up and down this directory tree and
automatically build all the pieces in the right order.

When you unpack the binutils-2.5.tar.gz file, you'll get a directory
called something like `binutils-2.5', which contains:

	COPYING          bfd/             configure*       libiberty/
	COPYING.LIB      binutils/        configure.in     move-if-change*
	CYGNUS           build-all.mk     etc/             opcodes/
	ChangeLog        config/          gprof/           test-build.mk
	Makefile.in      config.guess*    inc

To build binutils, you can just do:

	cd binutils-2.5
	./configure [ --enable-targets='target1,target2...' ]
	make
	make install # copies the programs files into /usr/local/bin
		     # by default.

This will configure and build all the libraries as well as binutils
and the linker.

The --enable-targets option adds support for more binary file
formats besides the default.  By default, support for only the
selected target file format is compiled in.  To add support for more
formats, list them as the argument to --enable-targets, separated by
commas.  For example:

	./configure --enable-targets=sun3,rs6000-aix,decstation

The name 'all' compiles in support for all valid BFD targets (this was
the default in previous releases):

	./configure --enable-targets=all

The binutils can be used in a cross-development environment.
The file etc/configure.texi contains more information.

Porting
=======
Binutils-2.5 supports many different architectures, but there
are many more not supported, including some that were supported
by earlier versions.  We are hoping for volunteers to
improve this situation.

The major effort in porting binutils to a new host and/or target
architecture involves the BFD library.  There is some documentation
in ../bfd/doc.  The file ../gdb/doc/gdbint.texinfo (distributed
with gdb-4.x) may also be of help.

If your system uses some variant of old-style a.out-format,
you can start with a copy of bfd/newsos3.c, and edit it to fit.
(You may also need to tweak bfd/aout-target.h.)
Alternatively, you could use the host-aout.c target.  This is a
special kludge that only works for native (non-cross) configurations.

Reporting bugs
==============
If you can't track down a bug and send suggestions/patches
for fixes, you should probably *not* be using this release.
We have little time to spend tracking down whatever random bugs you
may run into (except for configurations that Cygnus supports for
its customers).  The general place to send bug reports or patches
is to bug-gnu-utils@ai.mit.edu; you can also send them directly to
raeburn@cygnus.com or ian@cygnus.com.
