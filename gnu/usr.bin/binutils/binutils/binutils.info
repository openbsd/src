     ar [-]P[MOD [RELPOS]] ARCHIVE [MEMBER...]
     ar -M [ <mri-script ]

   The GNU `ar' program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives.
An "archive" is a single file holding a collection of other files in a
structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual
files (called "members" of the archive).

   The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner,
and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on
extraction.

   GNU `ar' can maintain archives whose members have names of any
length; however, depending on how `ar' is configured on your system, a
limit on member-name length may be imposed for compatibility with
archive formats maintained with other tools.  If it exists, the limit
is often 15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16
characters (typical of formats related to coff).

   `ar' is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort
are most often used as "libraries" holding commonly needed subroutines.

   `ar' creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable object
modules in the archive when you specify the modifier `s'.  Once
created, this index is updated in the archive whenever `ar' makes a
change to its contents (save for the `q' update operation).  An archive
with such an index speeds up linking to the library, and allows
routines in the library to call each other without regard to their
placement in the archive.

   You may use `nm -s' or `nm --print-armap' to list this index table.
If an archive lacks the table, another form of `ar' called `ranlib' can
be used to add just the table.

   GNU `ar' is designed to be compatible with two different facilities.
You can control its activity using command-line options, like the
different varieties of `ar' on Unix systems; or, if you specify the
single command-line option `-M', you can control it with a script
supplied via standard input, like the MRI "librarian" program.

Controlling `ar' on the command line
====================================

     ar [-]P[MOD [RELPOS]] ARCHIVE [MEMBER...]

   When you use `ar' in the Unix style, `ar' insists on at least two
arguments to execute: one keyletter specifying the *operation*
(optionally accompanied by other keyletters specifying *modifiers*),
and the archive name to act on.

   Most operations can also accept further MEMBER arguments, specifying
particular files to operate on.

   GNU `ar' allows you to mix the operation code P and modifier flags
MOD in any order, within the first command-line argument.

   If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a
dash.

   The P keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may be any
of the following, but you must specify only one of them:

`d'
     *Delete* modules from the archive.  Specify the names of modules to
     be deleted as MEMBER...; the archive is untouched if you specify
     no files to delete.

     If you specify the `v' modifier, `ar' lists each module as it is
     deleted.

`m'
     Use this operation to *move* members in an archive.

     The ordering of members in an archive can make a difference in how
     programs are linked using the library, if a symbol is defined in
     more than one member.

     If no modifiers are used with `m', any members you name in the
     MEMBER arguments are moved to the *end* of the archive; you can
     use the `a', `b', or `i' modifiers to move them to a specified
     place instead.

`p'
     *Print* the specified members of the archive, to the standard
     output file.  If the `v' modifier is specified, show the member
     name before copying its contents to standard output.

     If you specify no MEMBER arguments, all the files in the archive
     are printed.

`q'
     *Quick append*; add the files MEMBER... to the end of ARCHIVE,
     without checking for replacement.

     The modifiers `a', `b', and `i' do *not* affect this operation;
     new members are always placed at the end of the archive.

     The modifier `v' makes `ar' list each file as it is appended.

     Since the point of this operation is speed, the archive's symbol
     table index is not updated, even if it already existed; you can
     use `ar s' or `ranlib' explicitly to update the symbol table index.

`r'
     Insert the files MEMBER... into ARCHIVE (with *replacement*). This
     operation differs from `q' in that any previously existing members
     are deleted if their names match those being added.

     If one of the files named in MEMBER... does not exist, `ar'
     displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any existing
     members of the archive matching that name.

     By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but you
     may use one of the modifiers `a', `b', or `i' to request placement
     relative to some existing member.

     The modifier `v' used with this operation elicits a line of output
     for each file inserted, along with one of the letters `a' or `r'
     to indicate whether the file was appended (no old member deleted)
     or replaced.

`t'
     Display a *table* listing the contents of ARCHIVE, or those of the
     files listed in MEMBER... that are present in the archive.
     Normally only the member name is shown; if you also want to see
     the modes (permissions), timestamp, owner, group, and size, you can
     request that by also specifying the `v' modifier.

     If you do not specify a MEMBER, all files in the archive are
     listed.

     If there is more than one file with the same name (say, `fie') in
     an archive (say `b.a'), `ar t b.a fie' lists only the first
     instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete listing--in
     our example, `ar t b.a'.

`x'
     *Extract* members (named MEMBER) from the archive.  You can use
     the `v' modifier with this operation, to request that `ar' list
     each name as it extracts it.

     If you do not specify a MEMBER, all files in the archive are
     extracted.

   A number of modifiers (MOD) may immediately follow the P keyletter,
to specify variations on an operation's behavior:

`a'
     Add new files *after* an existing member of the archive.  If you
     use the modifier `a', the name of an existing archive member must
     be present as the RELPOS argument, before the ARCHIVE
     specification.

`b'
     Add new files *before* an existing member of the archive.  If you
     use the modifier `b', the name of an existing archive member must
     be present as the RELPOS argument, before the ARCHIVE
     specification.  (same as `i').

`c'
     *Create* the archive.  The specified ARCHIVE is always created if
     it did not exist, when you request an update.  But a warning is
     issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it,
     by using this modifier.

`f'
     Truncate names in the archive.  GNU `ar' will normally permit file
     names of any length.  This will cause it to create archives which
     are not compatible with the native `ar' program on some systems.
     If this is a concern, the `f' modifier may be used to truncate file
     names when putting them in the archive.

`i'
     Insert new files *before* an existing member of the archive.  If
     you use the modifier `i', the name of an existing archive member
     must be present as the RELPOS argument, before the ARCHIVE
     specification.  (same as `b').

`l'
     This modifier is accepted but not used.

`o'
     Preserve the *original* dates of members when extracting them.  If
     you do not specify this modifier, files extracted from the archive
     are stamped with the time of extraction.

`s'
     Write an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing
     one, even if no other change is made to the archive.  You may use
     this modifier flag either with any operation, or alone.  Running
     `ar s' on an archive is equivalent to running `ranlib' on it.

`u'
     Normally, `ar r'... inserts all files listed into the archive.  If
     you would like to insert *only* those of the files you list that
     are newer than existing members of the same names, use this
     modifier.  The `u' modifier is allowed only for the operation `r'
     (replace).  In particular, the combination `qu' is not allowed,
     since checking the timestamps would lose any speed advantage from
     the operation `q'.

`v'
     This modifier requests the *verbose* version of an operation.  Many
     operations display additional information, such as filenames
     processed, when the modifier `v' is appended.

`V'
     This modifier shows the version number of `ar'.

Controlling `ar' with a script
==============================

     ar -M [ <SCRIPT ]

   If you use the single command-line option `-M' with `ar', you can
control its operation with a rudimentary command language.  This form
of `ar' operates interactively if standard input is coming directly
from a terminal.  During interactive use, `ar' prompts for input (the
prompt is `AR >'), and continues executing even after errors.  If you
redirect standard input to a script file, no prompts are issued, and
`ar' abandons execution (with a nonzero exit code) on any error.

   The `ar' command language is *not* designed to be equivalent to the
command-line options; in fact, it provides somewhat less control over
archives.  The only purpose of the command language is to ease the
transition to GNU `ar' for developers who already have scripts written
for the MRI "librarian" program.

   The syntax for the `ar' command language is straightforward:
   * commands are recognized in upper or lower case; for example, `LIST'
     is the same as `list'.  In the following descriptions, commands are
     shown in upper case for clarity.

   * a single command may appear on each line; it is the first word on
     the line.

   * empty lines are allowed, and have no effect.

   * comments are allowed; text after either of the characters `*' or
     `;' is ignored.

   * Whenever you use a list of names as part of the argument to an `ar'
     command, you can separate the individual names with either commas
     or blanks.  Commas are shown in the explanations below, for
     clarity.

   * `+' is used as a line continuation character; if `+' appears at
     the end of a line, the text on the following line is considered
     part of the current command.

   Here are the commands you can use in `ar' scripts, or when using
`ar' interactively.  Three of them have special significance:

   `OPEN' or `CREATE' specify a "current archive", which is a temporary
file required for most of the other commands.

   `SAVE' commits the changes so far specified by the script.  Prior to
`SAVE', commands affect only the temporary copy of the current archive.

`ADDLIB ARCHIVE'
`ADDLIB ARCHIVE (MODULE, MODULE, ... MODULE)'
     Add all the contents of ARCHIVE (or, if specified, each named
     MODULE from ARCHIVE) to the current archive.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`ADDMOD MEMBER, MEMBER, ... MEMBER'
     Add each named MEMBER as a module in the current archive.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`CLEAR'
     Discard the contents of the current archive, cancelling the effect
     of any operations since the last `SAVE'.  May be executed (with no
     effect) even if  no current archive is specified.

`CREATE ARCHIVE'
     Creates an archive, and makes it the current archive (required for
     many other commands).  The new archive is created with a temporary
     name; it is not actually saved as ARCHIVE until you use `SAVE'.
     You can overwrite existing archives; similarly, the contents of any
     existing file named ARCHIVE will not be destroyed until `SAVE'.

`DELETE MODULE, MODULE, ... MODULE'
     Delete each listed MODULE from the current archive; equivalent to
     `ar -d ARCHIVE MODULE ... MODULE'.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`DIRECTORY ARCHIVE (MODULE, ... MODULE)'
`DIRECTORY ARCHIVE (MODULE, ... MODULE) OUTPUTFILE'
     List each named MODULE present in ARCHIVE.  The separate command
     `VERBOSE' specifies the form of the output: when verbose output is
     off, output is like that of `ar -t ARCHIVE MODULE...'.  When
     verbose output is on, the listing is like `ar -tv ARCHIVE
     MODULE...'.

     Output normally goes to the standard output stream; however, if you
     specify OUTPUTFILE as a final argument, `ar' directs the output to
     that file.

`END'
     Exit from `ar', with a `0' exit code to indicate successful
     completion.  This command does not save the output file; if you
     have changed the current archive since the last `SAVE' command,
     those changes are lost.

`EXTRACT MODULE, MODULE, ... MODULE'
     Extract each named MODULE from the current archive, writing them
     into the current directory as separate files.  Equivalent to `ar -x
     ARCHIVE MODULE...'.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`LIST'
     Display full contents of the current archive, in "verbose" style
     regardless of the state of `VERBOSE'.  The effect is like `ar tv
     ARCHIVE').  (This single command is a GNU `ld' enhancement, rather
     than present for MRI compatibility.)

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`OPEN ARCHIVE'
     Opens an existing archive for use as the current archive (required
     for many other commands).  Any changes as the result of subsequent
     commands will not actually affect ARCHIVE until you next use
     `SAVE'.

`REPLACE MODULE, MODULE, ... MODULE'
     In the current archive, replace each existing MODULE (named in the
     `REPLACE' arguments) from files in the current working directory.
     To execute this command without errors, both the file, and the
     module in the current archive, must exist.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`VERBOSE'
     Toggle an internal flag governing the output from `DIRECTORY'.
     When the flag is on, `DIRECTORY' output matches output from `ar
     -tv '....

`SAVE'
     Commit your changes to the current archive, and actually save it
     as a file with the name specified in the last `CREATE' or `OPEN'
     command.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

   GNU `nm' lists the symbols from object files OBJFILE....  If no
object files are listed as arguments, `nm' assumes `a.out'.

   For each symbol, `nm' shows:

   * The symbol value, in the radix selected by options (see below), or
     hexadecimal by default.

   * The symbol type.  At least the following types are used; others
     are, as well, depending on the object file format.  If lowercase,
     the symbol is local; if uppercase, the symbol is global (external).

    `A'
          Absolute.

    `B'
          BSS (uninitialized data).

    `C'
          Common.

    `D'
          Initialized data.

    `I'
          Indirect reference.

    `T'
          Text (program code).

    `U'
          Undefined.

   * The symbol name.

   The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.

`-A'
`-o'
`--print-file-name'
     Precede each symbol by the name of the input file (or archive
     element) in which it was found, rather than identifying the input
     file once only, before all of its symbols.

`-a'
`--debug-syms'
     Display all symbols, even debugger-only symbols; normally these
     are not listed.

`-B'
     The same as `--format=bsd' (for compatibility with the MIPS `nm').

`-C'
`--demangle'
     Decode ("demangle") low-level symbol names into user-level names.
     Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system,
     this makes C++ function names readable.  *Note c++filt::, for more
     information on demangling.

`--no-demangle'
     Do not demangle low-level symbol names.  This is the default.

`-D'
`--dynamic'
     Display the dynamic symbols rather than the normal symbols.  This
     is only meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of
     shared libraries.

`-f FORMAT'
`--format=FORMAT'
     Use the output format FORMAT, which can be `bsd', `sysv', or
     `posix'.  The default is `bsd'.  Only the first character of
     FORMAT is significant; it can be either upper or lower case.

`-g'
`--extern-only'
     Display only external symbols.

`-n'
`-v'
`--numeric-sort'
     Sort symbols numerically by their addresses, rather than
     alphabetically by their names.

`-p'
`--no-sort'
     Do not bother to sort the symbols in any order; print them in the
     order encountered.

`-P'
`--portability'
     Use the POSIX.2 standard output format instead of the default
     format.  Equivalent to `-f posix'.

`-s'
`--print-armap'
     When listing symbols from archive members, include the index: a
     mapping (stored in the archive by `ar' or `ranlib') of which
     modules contain definitions for which names.

`-r'
`--reverse-sort'
     Reverse the order of the sort (whether numeric or alphabetic); let
     the last come first.

`--size-sort'
     Sort symbols by size.  The size is computed as the difference
     between the value of the symbol and the value of the symbol with
     the next higher value.  The size of the symbol is printed, rather
     than the value.

`-t RADIX'
`--radix=RADIX'
     Use RADIX as the radix for printing the symbol values.  It must be
     `d' for decimal, `o' for octal, or `x' for hexadecimal.

`--target=BFDNAME'
     Specify an object code format other than your system's default
     format.  *Note Target Selection::, for more information.

`-u'
`--undefined-only'
     Display only undefined symbols (those external to each object
     file).

`-V'
`--version'
     Show the version number of `nm' and exit.

`--help'
     Show a summary of the options to `nm' and exit.

             INFILE [OUTFILE]

   The GNU `objcopy' utility copies the contents of an object file to
another.  `objcopy' uses the GNU BFD Library to read and write the
object files.  It can write the destination object file in a format
different from that of the source object file.  The exact behavior of
`objcopy' is controlled by command-line options.

   `objcopy' creates temporary files to do its translations and deletes
them afterward.  `objcopy' uses BFD to do all its translation work; it
has access to all the formats described in BFD and thus is able to
recognize most formats without being told explicitly.  *Note BFD:
(ld.info)BFD.

   `objcopy' can be used to generate S-records by using an output
target of `srec' (e.g., use `-O srec').

   `objcopy' can be used to generate a raw binary file by using an
output target of `binary' (e.g., use `-O binary').  When `objcopy'
generates a raw binary file, it will essentially produce a memory dump
of the contents of the input object file.  All symbols and relocation
information will be discarded.  The memory dump will start at the
virtual address of the lowest section copied into the output file.

   When generating an S-record or a raw binary file, it may be helpful
to use `-S' to remove sections containing debugging information.  In
some cases `-R' will be useful to remove sections which contain
information which is not needed by the binary file.

`INFILE'
`OUTFILE'
     The source and output files, respectively.  If you do not specify
     OUTFILE, `objcopy' creates a temporary file and destructively
     renames the result with the name of INFILE.

`-I BFDNAME'
`--input-target=BFDNAME'
     Consider the source file's object format to be BFDNAME, rather than
     attempting to deduce it.  *Note Target Selection::, for more
     information.

`-O BFDNAME'
`--output-target=BFDNAME'
     Write the output file using the object format BFDNAME.  *Note
     Target Selection::, for more information.

`-F BFDNAME'
`--target=BFDNAME'
     Use BFDNAME as the object format for both the input and the output
     file; i.e., simply transfer data from source to destination with no
     translation.  *Note Target Selection::, for more information.

`-R SECTIONNAME'
`--remove-section=SECTIONNAME'
     Remove any section named SECTIONNAME from the output file.  This
     option may be given more than once.  Note that using this option
     inappropriately may make the output file unusable.

`-S'
`--strip-all'
     Do not copy relocation and symbol information from the source file.

`-g'
`--strip-debug'
     Do not copy debugging symbols from the source file.

`--strip-unneeded'
     Strip all symbols that are not needed for relocation processing.

`-K SYMBOLNAME'
`--keep-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     Copy only symbol SYMBOLNAME from the source file.  This option may
     be given more than once.

`-N SYMBOLNAME'
`--strip-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     Do not copy symbol SYMBOLNAME from the source file.  This option
     may be given more than once, and may be combined with strip options
     other than `-K'.

`-x'
`--discard-all'
     Do not copy non-global symbols from the source file.

`-X'
`--discard-locals'
     Do not copy compiler-generated local symbols.  (These usually
     start with `L' or `.'.)

`-b BYTE'
`--byte=BYTE'
     Keep only every BYTEth byte of the input file (header data is not
     affected).  BYTE can be in the range from 0 to INTERLEAVE-1, where
     INTERLEAVE is given by the `-i' or `--interleave' option, or the
     default of 4.  This option is useful for creating files to program
     ROM.  It is typically used with an `srec' output target.

`-i INTERLEAVE'
`--interleave=INTERLEAVE'
     Only copy one out of every INTERLEAVE bytes.  Select which byte to
     copy with the -B or `--byte' option.  The default is 4.  `objcopy'
     ignores this option if you do not specify either `-b' or `--byte'.

`--gap-fill VAL'
     Fill gaps between sections with VAL.  This is done by increasing
     the size of the section with the lower address, and filling in the
     extra space created with VAL.

`--pad-to ADDRESS'
     Pad the output file up to the virtual address ADDRESS.  This is
     done by increasing the size of the last section.  The extra space
     is filled in with the value specified by `--gap-fill' (default
     zero).

`--set-start VAL'
     Set the address of the new file to VAL.  Not all object file
     formats support setting the start address.

`--adjust-start INCR'
     Adjust the start address by adding INCR.  Not all object file
     formats support setting the start address.

`--adjust-vma INCR'
     Adjust the address of all sections, as well as the start address,
     by adding INCR.  Some object file formats do not permit section
     addresses to be changed arbitrarily.  Note that this does not
     relocate the sections; if the program expects sections to be
     loaded at a certain address, and this option is used to change the
     sections such that they are loaded at a different address, the
     program may fail.

`--adjust-section-vma SECTION{=,+,-}VAL'
     Set or adjust the address of the named SECTION.  If `=' is used,
     the section address is set to VAL.  Otherwise, VAL is added to or
     subtracted from the section address.  See the comments under
     `--adjust-vma', above.  If SECTION does not exist in the input
     file, a warning will be issued, unless `--no-adjust-warnings' is
     used.

`--adjust-warnings'
     If `--adjust-section-vma' is used, and the named section does not
     exist, issue a warning.  This is the default.

`--no-adjust-warnings'
     Do not issue a warning if `--adjust-section-vma' is used, even if
     the named section does not exist.

`--set-section-flags SECTION=FLAGS'
     Set the flags for the named section.  The FLAGS argument is a
     comma separated string of flag names.  The recognized names are
     `alloc', `load', `readonly', `code', `data', and `rom'.  Not all
     flags are meaningful for all object file formats.

`--add-section SECTIONNAME=FILENAME'
     Add a new section named SECTIONNAME while copying the file.  The
     contents of the new section are taken from the file FILENAME.  The
     size of the section will be the size of the file.  This option only
     works on file formats which can support sections with arbitrary
     names.

`-V'
`--version'
     Show the version number of `objcopy'.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Verbose output: list all object files modified.  In the case of
     archives, `objcopy -V' lists all members of the archive.

`--help'
     Show a summary of the options to `objcopy'.

             OBJFILE...

   `objdump' displays information about one or more object files.  The
options control what particular information to display.  This
information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the
compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their
program to compile and work.

   OBJFILE... are the object files to be examined.  When you specify
archives, `objdump' shows information on each of the member object
files.

   The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.  At least one option besides `-l' must be given.

`-a'
`--archive-header'
     If any of the OBJFILE files are archives, display the archive
     header information (in a format similar to `ls -l').  Besides the
     information you could list with `ar tv', `objdump -a' shows the
     object file format of each archive member.

`-b BFDNAME'
`--target=BFDNAME'
     Specify that the object-code format for the object files is
     BFDNAME.  This option may not be necessary; OBJDUMP can
     automatically recognize many formats.

     For example,
          objdump -b oasys -m vax -h fu.o

     displays summary information from the section headers (`-h') of
     `fu.o', which is explicitly identified (`-m') as a VAX object file
     in the format produced by Oasys compilers.  You can list the
     formats available with the `-i' option.  *Note Target Selection::,
     for more information.

`-d'
`--disassemble'
     Display the assembler mnemonics for the machine instructions from
     OBJFILE.  This option only disassembles those sections which are
     expected to contain instructions.

`-D'
`--disassemble-all'
     Like `-d', but disassemble the contents of all sections, not just
     those expected to contain instructions.

`-f'
`--file-header'
     Display summary information from the overall header of each of the
     OBJFILE files.

`-h'
`--section-header'
`--header'
     Display summary information from the section headers of the object
     file.

     File segments may be relocated to nonstandard addresses, for
     example by using the `-Ttext', `-Tdata', or `-Tbss' options to
     `ld'.  However, some object file formats, such as a.out, do not
     store the starting address of the file segments.  In those
     situations, although `ld' relocates the sections correctly, using
     `objdump -h' to list the file section headers cannot show the
     correct addresses.  Instead, it shows the usual addresses, which
     are implicit for the target.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `objdump' and exit.

`-i'
`--info'
     Display a list showing all architectures and object formats
     available for specification with `-b' or `-m'.

`-j NAME'
`--section=NAME'
     Display information only for section NAME.

`-l'
`--line-numbers'
     Label the display (using debugging information) with the filename
     and source line numbers corresponding to the object code shown.
     Only useful with `-d' or `-D'.

`-m MACHINE'
`--architecture=MACHINE'
     Specify that the object files OBJFILE are for architecture
     MACHINE.  You can list available architectures using the `-i'
     option.

`-r'
`--reloc'
     Print the relocation entries of the file.  If used with `-d' or
     `-D', the relocations are printed interspersed with the
     disassembly.

`-R'
`--dynamic-reloc'
     Print the dynamic relocation entries of the file.  This is only
     meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
     libraries.

`-s'
`--full-contents'
     Display the full contents of any sections requested.

`-S'
`--source'
     Display source code intermixed with disassembly, if possible.
     Implies `-d'.

`--stabs'
     Display the full contents of any sections requested.  Display the
     contents of the .stab and .stab.index and .stab.excl sections from
     an ELF file.  This is only useful on systems (such as Solaris 2.0)
     in which `.stab' debugging symbol-table entries are carried in an
     ELF section.  In most other file formats, debugging symbol-table
     entries are interleaved with linkage symbols, and are visible in
     the `--syms' output.

`--start-address=ADDRESS'
     Start displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the
     output of the `-d', `-r' and `-s' options.

`--stop-address=ADDRESS'
     Stop displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the
     output of the `-d', `-r' and `-s' options.

`-t'
`--syms'
     Print the symbol table entries of the file.  This is similar to
     the information provided by the `nm' program.

`-T'
`--dynamic-syms'
     Print the dynamic symbol table entries of the file.  This is only
     meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
     libraries.  This is similar to the information provided by the `nm'
     program when given the `-D' (`--dynamic') option.

`--version'
     Print the version number of `objdump' and exit.

`-x'
`--all-header'
     Display all available header information, including the symbol
     table and relocation entries.  Using `-x' is equivalent to
     specifying all of `-a -f -h -r -t'.

`-w'
`--wide'
     Format some lines for output devices that have more than 80
     columns.

     ranlib [-vV] ARCHIVE

   `ranlib' generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores
it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by a member of
an archive that is a relocatable object file.

   You may use `nm -s' or `nm --print-armap' to list this index.

   An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and
allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to
their placement in the archive.

   The GNU `ranlib' program is another form of GNU `ar'; running
`ranlib' is completely equivalent to executing `ar -s'.  *Note ar::.

          OBJFILE...

   The GNU `size' utility lists the section sizes--and the total
size--for each of the object or archive files OBJFILE in its argument
list.  By default, one line of output is generated for each object file
or each module in an archive.

   OBJFILE... are the object files to be examined.

   The command line options have the following meanings:

`-A'
`-B'
`--format=COMPATIBILITY'
     Using one of these options, you can choose whether the output from
     GNU `size' resembles output from System V `size' (using `-A', or
     `--format=sysv'), or Berkeley `size' (using `-B', or
     `--format=berkeley').  The default is the one-line format similar
     to Berkeley's.

     Here is an example of the Berkeley (default) format of output from
     `size':
          size --format=Berkeley ranlib size
          text    data    bss     dec     hex     filename

          294880  81920   11888   388688  5ee50   size

     This is the same data, but displayed closer to System V
     conventions:

          size --format=SysV ranlib size
          ranlib  :
          section         size         addr

          Total         388688

`--help'
     Show a summary of acceptable arguments and options.

`-d'
`-o'
`-x'
`--radix=NUMBER'
     Using one of these options, you can control whether the size of
     each section is given in decimal (`-d', or `--radix=10'); octal
     (`-o', or `--radix=8'); or hexadecimal (`-x', or `--radix=16').
     In `--radix=NUMBER', only the three values (8, 10, 16) are
     supported.  The total size is always given in two radices; decimal
     and hexadecimal for `-d' or `-x' output, or octal and hexadecimal
     if you're using `-o'.

`--target=BFDNAME'
     Specify that the object-code format for OBJFILE is BFDNAME.  This
     option may not be necessary; `size' can automatically recognize
     many formats.  *Note Target Selection::, for more information.

`-V'

   For each FILE given, GNU `strings' prints the printable character
sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with
the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character.  By
default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded
sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the
strings from the whole file.

   `strings' is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text
files.

`-a'

`--help'
     Print a summary of the program usage on the standard output and

`-MIN-LEN'
`-n MIN-LEN'
`--bytes=MIN-LEN'
     Print sequences of characters that are at least MIN-LEN characters
     long, instead of the default 4.

`-o'

     `-t d' instead.  Since we can not be compatible with both ways, we
     simply chose one.

`-t RADIX'
`--radix=RADIX'
     Print the offset within the file before each string.  The single
     character argument specifies the radix of the offset--`o' for
     octal, `x' for hexadecimal, or `d' for decimal.

`--target=BFDNAME'
     Specify an object code format other than your system's default
     format.  *Note Target Selection::, for more information.

             [ --help ]  [ --version ]  [ SYMBOL... ]

   The C++ language provides function overloading, which means that you
can write many functions with the same name (providing each takes
parameters of different types).  All C++ function names are encoded
into a low-level assembly label (this process is known as "mangling").
The `c++filt' program does the inverse mapping: it decodes
("demangles") low-level names into user-level names so that the linker
can keep these overloaded functions from clashing.

   Every alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits, underscores,
dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a potential label.  If the
label decodes into a C++ name, the C++ name replaces the low-level name
in the output.

   You can use `c++filt' to decipher individual symbols:

     c++filt SYMBOL

   If no SYMBOL arguments are given, `c++filt' reads symbol names from
the standard input and writes the demangled names to the standard
output.  All results are printed on the standard output.

`-_'
`--strip-underscores'
     On some systems, both the C and C++ compilers put an underscore in
     front of every name.  For example, the C name `foo' gets the
     low-level name `_foo'.  This option removes the initial
     underscore.  Whether `c++filt' removes the underscore by default
     is target dependent.

`-n'
`--no-strip-underscores'
     Do not remove the initial underscore.

`-s FORMAT'
`--format=FORMAT'
     GNU `nm' can decode three different methods of mangling, used by
     different C++ compilers.  The argument to this option selects which
     method it uses:

   `nlmconv' converts the relocatable `i386' object file INFILE into
the NetWare Loadable Module OUTFILE, optionally reading HEADERFILE for
NLM header information.  For instructions on writing the NLM command
file language used in header files, see the `linkers' section,
`NLMLINK' in particular, of the `NLM Development and Tools Overview',
which is part of the NLM Software Developer's Kit ("NLM SDK"),
available from Novell, Inc.  `nlmconv' uses the GNU Binary File
Descriptor library to read INFILE; see *Note BFD: (ld.info)BFD, for
more information.

   `nlmconv' can perform a link step.  In other words, you can list
more than one object file for input if you list them in the definitions
file (rather than simply specifying one input file on the command line).
In this case, `nlmconv' calls the linker for you.

`-I BFDNAME'
`--input-target=BFDNAME'
     Object format of the input file.  `nlmconv' can usually determine
     the format of a given file (so no default is necessary).  *Note
     Target Selection::, for more information.

`-O BFDNAME'
`--output-target=BFDNAME'
     Object format of the output file.  `nlmconv' infers the output
     format based on the input format, e.g. for a `i386' input file the
     output format is `nlm32-i386'.  *Note Target Selection::, for more
     information.

     Reads HEADERFILE for NLM header information.  For instructions on
     writing the NLM command file language used in header files, see
     see the `linkers' section, of the `NLM Development and Tools
     Overview', which is part of the NLM Software Developer's Kit,
     available from Novell, Inc.

`-d'
`--debug'
     Displays (on standard error) the linker command line used by
     `nlmconv'.

`-l LINKER'
`--linker=LINKER'
     Use LINKER for any linking.  LINKER can be an abosolute or a
     relative pathname.

`-h'
`--help'
     Prints a usage summary.

`-V'

Selecting the target system
***************************

   You can specify three aspects of the target system to the GNU binary
file utilities, each in several ways:

   * the target

   * the architecture

   * the linker emulation (which applies to the linker only)

   In the following summaries, the lists of ways to specify values are
in order of decreasing precedence.  The ways listed first override those
listed later.

   The commands to list valid values only list the values for which the
programs you are running were configured.  If they were configured with
`--enable-targets=all', the commands list most of the available values,
but a few are left out; not all targets can be configured in at once
because some of them can only be configured "native" (on hosts with the
same type as the target system).

* Target Selection::
* Architecture Selection::
* Linker Emulation Selection::

Target Selection
================

   A "target" is an object file format.  A given target may be
supported for multiple architectures (*note Architecture Selection::.).
A target selection may also have variations for different operating
systems or architectures.

   The command to list valid target values is `objdump -i' (the first
column of output contains the relevant information).

   Some sample values are: `a.out-hp300bsd', `ecoff-littlemips',
`a.out-sunos-big'.

`objdump' Target
----------------

   Ways to specify:

  1. command line option: `-b' or `--target'

  2. environment variable `GNUTARGET'

  3. deduced from the input file

`objcopy' and `strip' Input Target
----------------------------------

   Ways to specify:

  1. command line options: `-I' or `--input-target', or `-F' or
     `--target'

  2. environment variable `GNUTARGET'

  3. deduced from the input file

`objcopy' and `strip' Output Target
-----------------------------------

   Ways to specify:

  1. command line options: `-O' or `--output-target', or `-F' or
     `--target'

  2. the input target (see "`objcopy' and `strip' Input Target" above)

  3. environment variable `GNUTARGET'

  4. deduced from the input file

`nm', `size', and `strings' Target
----------------------------------

   Ways to specify:

  1. command line option: `--target'

  2. environment variable `GNUTARGET'

  3. deduced from the input file

Linker Input Target
-------------------

   Ways to specify:

  1. command line option: `-b' or `--format' (*note Options:
     (ld.info)Options.)

  2. script command `TARGET' (*note Option Commands: (ld.info)Option
     Commands.)

  3. environment variable `GNUTARGET' (*note Environment:
     (ld.info)Environment.)

  4. the default target of the selected linker emulation (*note Linker
     Emulation Selection::.)

Linker Output Target
--------------------

   Ways to specify:

  1. command line option: `-oformat' (*note Options: (ld.info)Options.)

  2. script command `OUTPUT_FORMAT' (*note Option Commands:
     (ld.info)Option Commands.)

  3. the linker input target (see "Linker Input Target" above)

Architecture selection
======================

   An "architecture" is a type of CPU on which an object file is to
run.  Its name may contain a colon, separating the name of the
processor family from the name of the particular CPU.

   The command to list valid architecture values is `objdump -i' (the
second column contains the relevant information).

   Sample values: `m68k:68020', `mips:3000', `sparc'.

`objdump' Architecture
----------------------

   Ways to specify:

  1. command line option: `-m' or `--architecture'

  2. deduced from the input file

`objcopy', `nm', `size', `strings' Architecture
-----------------------------------------------

   Ways to specify:

  1. deduced from the input file

Linker Input Architecture
-------------------------

   Ways to specify:

  1. deduced from the input file

Linker Output Architecture
--------------------------

   Ways to specify:

  1. script command `OUTPUT_ARCH' (*note Option Commands:
     (ld.info)Option Commands.)

  2. the default architecture from the linker output target (*note
     Target Selection::.)


File: binutils.info,  Node: Linker Emulation Selection,  Prev: Architecture Selection,  Up: Selecting The Target System

Linker emulation selection
==========================

   A linker "emulation" is a "personality" of the linker, which gives
the linker default values for the other aspects of the target system.
In particular, it consists of

   * the linker script

   * the target

   * several "hook" functions that are run at certain stages of the
     linking process to do special things that some targets require

   The command to list valid linker emulation values is `ld -V'.

   Sample values: `hp300bsd', `mipslit', `sun4'.

   Ways to specify:

  1. command line option: `-m' (*note Options: (ld.info)Options.)

  2. environment variable `LDEMULATION'

  3. compiled-in `DEFAULT_EMULATION' from `Makefile', which comes from
     `EMUL' in `config/TARGET.mt'
