Wed Jul 19 18:46:13 1995  Fred Fish  <fnf@cygnus.com>

	* core.c (get_src_info): Cast arg 7 of bfd_find_nearest_line

Tue Apr 25 21:11:12 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (install): Depend on "all".

Thu Apr 20 17:29:07 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: Change all references to MY_MACHINE to MY_TARGET,
	to match configure script.

Wed Apr 19 11:19:37 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* gen-c-prog.awk: Changed reference to "make-c-prog.awk" in

Mon Mar 13 21:44:24 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* __bb_exit_func.c: New file, from David Mosberger-Tang.

	Thu Feb  9 16:56:07 1995  David Mosberger-Tang  <davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu>

	* All *.c: More cleanup towards GNU format.

	* gmon_out.h (struct gmon_hist_hdr, struct gmon_cg_arc_record): 
	replaced sizeof (bfd_vma) by size (char*) because Ken tells me
	that bfd_vma is only guaranteed to be at least as big as a pointer.

	(GMON_Record_tag): added explicit enumeration values to ensure
	compatibility across compilers.

	* gmon_io.c (get_vma, put_vma): replaced sizeof(bfd_vma) by
	sizeof(char*).

Tue Feb  7 17:24:12 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* All *.c and *.h files: Ran "indent -gnu".  Cleaned up a couple
	of constructs GNU indent couldn't handle.  Block comments not yet
	rewritten in GNU format.

	* gprof.c (VERSION): Changed to 2.6, to get in sync for next
	binutils release.

Sun Feb  5 16:19:46 1995  David Mosberger-Tang  <davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu>

	* symtab.c (symtab_finalize): ensure globals symbols really
	are favored over static ones---even if their name looks less
	preferable; this is important for HP-UX; for example, there
	is a static label Ltext_something that aliases the global
	symbol _start

	* hist.c (hist_print): auto-scaling is now in effect for FSF-style
	output only; also, auto-scaling is now performed based on
	per-call, rather than total execution time, which is what it was
	meant to be.

	* gprof.h (File_Format): new type.

	* gprof.c (VERSION): upped to 2.7---seems to be completely out of
	sync with Cygnus version numbers though...

	(long_options): renamed --gmon-info to --file-info, --width added,
	renamed --old-file-format to --file-format
	(main): dito; also added support to read prof files, but as
	mon_out_read() is not implemented, it's #ifdef'd out for now

	(usage): update to reflect new options.

	* gmon_io.c: replaced "old_file_format" by more general
        "file_format" option

	* gmon.h (struct raw_phdr): fixed declaration for OSF/1.

	* core.c (core_sym_class): added back check for __gnu_compiled and
	___gnu_compiled for the benefit of systems without
	bfd_find_nearest_line() support

	(get_src_info): now the libbfd is fixed, invoke bfd_find_nearest_line()
	with section-relative addresses

	(core_create_function_syms): get_src_info() calls are currently
	enabled for OSF/1 only.  It appears to work allright for SunOS
        4.1.x as well, but on SPARCs it gets painfully slow with the
        current implementation of aout_32_find_nearest_line();
        unfortunately, this means that static functions will not have their
	filename printed in the call-graph function index; line-level
	profiling should still work, but requires some patience

	* cg_print.c (cg_print_index): sanitized printing of index when
	using FSF-style output; in particular, output width is now controlled
	via option --width and the function tries hard to keep columns
	aligned even in the presence of (occasional) long names

	* NOTES: a first shot at updating the documentation.

Wed Feb  1 19:07:44 1995  David Mosberger-Tang  <davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu>

	* core.c (core_create_function_syms): fixed computation of min_vma
	and max_vma.

	* *.c: removed rcsid.

Tue Jan 31 16:18:18 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* Lots of changes from David Mosberger-Tang:

	Tue Oct 25 19:20:14 1994  David Mosberger-Tang	<davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu>

	* gprof.c (main): put parentheses around & within &&.

	* basic_blocks.c (bb_read_rec): print warning message (once) when
	ignoring basic-block execution counts.

	* source.c (source_file_lookup_name): corrected second argument to
	strcmp().

	* hist.c (print_header): merged Fri Oct 21 18:58:02 1994 change by
	Ken Raeburn <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com> from binutils-2.5.1.

	* gmon_io.c (gmon_out_read): the output stule STYLE_GMON_INFO is now
	supported both for old and new (versioned) gmon.out files.  Old
	files are identified as version 0.

	* gmon.h (struct raw_arc): count field is now sizeof(long) bytes
	long (instead of 4) because that is what OSF/1 v3.0 uses.

	* core.c: minor fixes and debugging info changes.

	Sun Sep 11 18:47:47 1994  David Mosberger-Tang	(davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu)

	* core.c (core_init): if .text cannot be found, try $CODE$ (the
	name of the text-section under HP-UX).

	* hist.c (hist_assign_samples): fixed off-by-one bug: highpc
	points one past the last sampling bin, so hist_scale should be
	computed as "hist_scale /= hist_num_bins", not "hist_scale /=
	hist_num_bins - 1".

	* gmon_io.c, hist.c, hist.h: renamed hist_num_samples to
	hist_num_bins.

	* configure.in: added alpha-*-*) for per-target config.

	* alpha.c, alpha.h: created.

	* gprof.c (default_excluded_list): <locore>, <hicore> added.

	* core.c (core_create_function_syms, core_create_line_syms):
	explicitly keep two sentinels "<locore>" and "<hicore>" that catch
	all addresses outside the text-space.  Thus, sym_lookup(&symtab,
	addr) continues to guarantee not to return 0 on any address.  It
	also avoids incorrectly crediting the first/last symbol in the
	text-space.

	* core.c (core_create_line_syms): always create function symbols
	first, then merge in line symbols; this is so that if parts of the
	program were compiled without -g, function-level symbols are
	available still.

	* utils.c (print_name_only): support for print_path added.

	* symtab.c (cmp_addr): also use is_func flag in comparison.
	(symtab_finalize): return immediately when table empty; now
	more careful about getting rid of the right duplicate symbol.

	* sparc.c (find_call): many fixes---this function was rather
	botched in binutils-2.4 already; it should work again.

	* source.c (source_file_lookup_path): PATH is now strdup'ed (it is
	not good to rely on get_src_info() to return distinct string
	pointers).

	* search_list.c (search_list_append): added cast for xmalloc().

	* hist.c: added explicit initialization to some of the global
	variables; fixed SItab (scales were off by a factor of 10).

	* hist.h: include of bfd.h added.

	* gprof.c, gprof.h (print_path): added.

	* gprof.h (MAX): fixed.

	* gmon_out.h: renamed gmon_time_hist_hdr to gmon_hist_hdr.

	* gmon_io.c: added some casts to (long) so we can always print as %lx

	* core.c (core_get_text_space): fixed to make it work.

	* cg_print.c (cg_print_index): added support for print_path option.

	* cg_dfn.h (cg_dfn): wrap prototype in PARAMS().

	* call_graph.c, gmon_io.c, hist.c: avoid taking address of array
	as some compilers complain (e.g., DEC's OSF/1 compiler)

	* basic_blocks.c, gmon_io.c, hist.c, source.c, sym_ids.c,
	symtab.c: calls to memset() had 2nd and 3rd args reversed.

	Sat Sep 10 21:53:13 1994  David Mosberger-Tang	(davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu)

	* gprof.c: added "_mcount" to default_excluded_list.
	(main): if output_style==0 and there is either a histogram or a
	call-graph, always generate flat and call-graph, no matter what
	line_granularity is set to.

	* source.c (source_file_lookup_name): if searching for sf->name
	fails, try again with filename obtained after stripping off any
	partial path from sf->name.

	* gprof.h (SRCDEBUG): added.

	* search_list.c (search_list_append): directories were added in wrong
	order.

	* reimplemented selection mechanism from ground up; it is now possible
	to accurately control what gets included/excluded in each of the
	output styles;	a "symbol-specification" (spec) is the basic means
	to select a set of symbols; a spec has the syntax:

	  spec == (FILENAME:(FUNCNAME|LINE_NUM) | NAME).
	  arc == spec/spec.

	any of the terminal symbols can be empty, in which case they
	match anything (wildcards).  NAME is interpreted as a FILENAME
	if it contains a dot (e.g., foo.c), as LINE_NUM if it starts
	with a digit, and as FUNCNAME otherwise.

	For example, to get a call-graph display that ignores arcs
	from foo() to bar(), you'd say "--no-graph=foo/bar"; to
	show only arcs into bar() (no matter what the caller),
	you'd say "--graph=/bar"; and to get a call-graph without
	any arc info, you'd say "--graph=/";  similarly, to
	get a flat profile without mcount, you'd say "--no-flat=mcount"
	and to get a flat profile that shows includes all functions
	you'd say "--flat=""" (i.e., an empty spec)

	* hist.c (hist_print): top_time wasn't initialized to 0.0.

	Fri Sep	 9 01:10:21 1994  David Mosberger-Tang	(davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu)

	* gmon_out.h: all headers now declared in terms of characters
	  to avoid getting into trouble with different compilers introducing
	  different amount of padding; the code already accessed the fields
	  through bfd functions, so that didn't have to change.

	* hist.c (hist_read_rec, hist_write_rec): added support for
	  collection pc histograms measuring quantities other than time;
	  the histogram header now includes a field that specifies the
	  dimension of the quantity measured by the histogram bins
	  (normally, this is "seconds", but other meaningful dimensions
	   include such things as "I-cache misses", "instruction issue stalls"
	   etc.); there is also a field to specify a one-character
	  abbreviation for the dimension; in the case of time, this would
	  be 's'; in most other cases it probably would be '1' (not a physical
	  dimension).

	Thu Sep	 8 16:05:08 1994  David Mosberger-Tang	(davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu)

	* gprof.c, gmon_io.[ch]: BSD_COMPATIBLE is gone and new_file_version
	  has become old_file_version; gmon_io.c now always supports old-style
	  gmon.out files; it first tries to read gmon.out as a new version
	  file, if that fails, it tries to read it in the old format;
	  although not very likely, it is possible for gprof to mistake an
	  old-style file as a new one (the first 4 bytes would have to
	  be "gmon"---including the trailing '\0'); in that case, it is
	  necessary to specify --old-file-version

	* gprof.h: removed dependency on SYSV; the code now always uses
	  strrchr(), memset(), and memcpy() and does not include either
	  of string.h or strings.h; this should make gprof compile on
	  any (Unix) system without configuration (per suggestion of
	  raeburn@cygnus.com)

	* gprof.c (usage): fixed location of --new-file-format option.

	* cg_arcs.c (propagate_flags): fixed typo in declaration.

	* flat_bl.m: removed formfeed at end of file; the form-feed
	  is now printed cg_print.c only when necessary.

	* major rewrite of gprof---too many changes to mention all of
	  them.	 new features:

	+ -l now requests profiling at the line level (as opposed
	  to function level); in this mode, gprof creates a "symbol"
	  (aka name-list entry) for each line of source code, instead
	   of one per function)

	+ support for a new gmon.out file format; the new format 
	  consists of a header with a magic and a version number,
	  followed by a sequence of profile data; profile data
	  can any of: (a) PC histogram, (b) call-graph arcs, or
	  (c) basic-block execution counts; the version number makes
	  it possible to extend gmon.out in a backwards compatible
	  fashion

	+ support for tcov style annotated output: if the gmon.out file
	  contains basic-block execution counts, the user can request
	  the generation of annotated source files, much like Sun's
	  tcov used to do

	+ long options

	+ new scheme to suppress symbols that aren't function names
	  (e.g., avoids mistaking a goto label as a function)

	+ reorganized source code to make it more managable; as a
	  side effect, gprof now compiles cleanly with "gcc -Wall"

	Thu Sep	 1 15:46:49 1994  David Mosberger-Tang	(davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu)

	* gprof.c (funcsymbol): bfd_find_nearest_line() is now used as a
	final cross-check to determine whether a static symbol should be
	considered as a function-name.

	Fri Aug	 5 19:32:36 1994  David Mosberger-Tang	(davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu)

	* gmon_io.c (gmon_out_read): recognize "-" as the filename for
	stdin; this is useful if you wanna keep gmon.out files compressed;
	this way you can "gzcat" the compressed file into gprof.

	* gprof.c: flag_min_count now initialized with 1 instead of 0.

	* basic_blocks.c (bb_annotate_source): added support for creating
	.tcov files when option flag_annotate_make_files is TRUE.
	(annotate_with_count): all counts less than the minimum count
	specified by -m are now annotated with hash-marks.

	* gprof.c (main): -A is now followed by a string of option chars.

	* basic_blocks.c (annotate_with_count): replaced b->count with
	cnt.

	* source.c: flag_annotate_source replaced by source_lock_map.

	* source.h: source_lock_map added.

	* gprof.c (main): new command-line syntax: -S simply specifies
	which source-files user is interested in; -A requests annotated
	source files and -AA requests that all lines in a source file
	are annotated.

	Thu Aug	 4 23:27:03 1994  David Mosberger-Tang	(davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu)

	* basic_blocks.c (PATH_MAX): if undefined, define as 1024.

	* sparc.c, i386.c, tahoe.c, vax.c: added include of "time_hist.h"
	so s_lowpc etc. get declared.

	* arcs.h (doarcs): created.

	* arcs.c: reordered static functions such that they get defined
	before use.

	* gprof.c (main): added options:
	   -A: request annotation of all source lines (with -S)
	   -m: minimum execution count (with default basic-block display)
	   -N: force new file format (only if BSD_COMPATIBLE is defined)
	   -S: annotate source file
	   -t: set table length (with -S)

	* Makefile (OBJS): added basic_blocks.o call_graph.o gmon_io.o
	source.o time_hist.o

	Fri Jul	 1 15:23:50 1994  David Mosberger-Tang	(davidm@piston.cs.arizona.edu)

	* gprof.c (asgnsamples): computation of "pcl" and "pch" depended
	on the fact being able to store a long in a double without loss of
	precision; this does not hold on machines with 64 bit longs and 64
	bit doubles.

Fri Oct 21 18:58:02 1994  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* printgprof.c (flatprofheader): Always set totime to 1.0 if not
	greater than 0.0.  Suggested by Harold Assink
	<carlo@sg.tn.tudelft.nl>.

Fri Sep 23 15:06:45 1994  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* printgprof.c (printprof): Use free, not cfree.
	(printgprof, printindex): Ditto.

Thu Sep  1 10:40:45 1994  Jeff Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gprof.h (kfromlist, ktolist, flist, Flist, elist, Elist): Make
	decls extern to keep native HP compiler quiet.

Tue Aug 30 11:12:13 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* gprof.c (funcsymbol): Ignore ___gnu_compiled as well as
	__gnu_compiled, for the benefit of systems which add a leading
	underscore.

Wed Aug 24 12:49:13 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Change i386-*-* to i[345]86-*-*.

Sun Jul 10 00:35:31 1994  Ian Dall  (dall@hfrd.dsto.gov.au)

	* ns532.c, ns532.h: New Files. ns532 support.

	* config/mt-ns532: New File. ns532 support.

	* gprof.c: user register int i instead of defaulting the int.
	Allows compilation with -Dregister= for debugging.

	* configure.in: Add ns532 support.

Thu Jun 23 11:22:41 1994  Jeff Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* Makefile.in (gprof): Depend on $(LIBS).

Tue May 17 15:30:22 1994  E. Michael Smith (ems@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (.m.c:):  Added .SUFFIXES : .m 
	so flat_bl.c would make from flat_bl.m file.

Thu May  5 19:23:24 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (install-info): Check for gprof.info in build dir,
	fall back to srcdir.  Depend on it.

	* gprof.h (TRUE, FALSE): Always use undef before defining them.

Mon Apr  4 23:47:30 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* Makefile.in (MY_MACHINE): Renamed from MACHINE to avoid losing
	makes (osf1) in which the value of MACHINE can not be changed.
	* config/*.mt: Changed appropriately.

Wed Mar 30 16:12:40 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* gprof.c (getsymtab): Change nosyms to long.  Rename
	get_symtab_upper_bound to bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound.  Check for
	errors from bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound and

Tue Mar 22 10:50:52 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gprof.c (funcsymbol): Use bfd_get_symbol_info instead of
	bfd_decode_symclass.

Sun Mar 20 15:40:21 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* Makefile.in: Avoid bug in hpux sed.

Wed Dec 15 20:16:40 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo@andros.cygnus.com)

	* gprof.texi (Invoking): add text about -v flag

	* gprof.1: add text about -v flag

Wed Dec  8 16:55:06 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo@andros.cygnus.com)

	* gprof.c (VERSION): defined a version macro, print the value 
	when the -v option is used

Tue Jul  6 10:11:56 1993  Steve Chamberlain  (sac@phydeaux.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Install correctly.

Thu Jun 24 14:43:22 1993  David J. Mackenzie  (djm@thepub.cygnus.com)

	* gprof.c (main): Get whoami from argv, instead of hardcoding.
	Use it in usage message.  Split usage message to fit in 80 cols.

Sun Jun 20 20:58:02 1993  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@poseidon.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Undo 15 June change.

Wed Jun 16 12:54:53 1993  Steve Chamberlain  (sac@phydeaux.cygnus.com)

	* gmon.h, gprof.h: structs of chars used to hold external
	representations.
	* gprof.c (getpfile, openpfile, readsamples): Swap data in using
	new structures.

Tue Jun 15 23:09:17 1993  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cambridge.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (.c.o): Look in ../include, not ../bfd, for bfd.h.

Mon Jun 14 16:22:59 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at rtl.cygnus.com)

Tue May 18 21:44:11 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (install): should not depend on install-info

Mon Apr 26 12:37:46 1993  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* gprof.h: Include ansidecl.h before sysdep.h.  Undefine hz.

Tue Apr 13 16:14:03 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* M Makefile.in:  Add -g to CFLAGS.
	Ads LDFLAGS and use in place of CFLAGS where appropriate.

Thu Mar 25 19:00:37 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* gprof.texi: add INFO-DIR-ENTRY

Tue Mar 23 00:03:11 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: add installcheck target

Sat Feb 27 18:17:10 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* gprof.c (funcsymbol):  Invert test for aflag.

Thu Feb 25 16:01:50 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* printgprof (xmalloc, xrealloc):  Cast results of malloc
	and realloc to PTR.

Wed Feb  3 13:55:33 1993  Jeffrey Osier  (jeffrey@fowanton.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: created info, install-info, dvi

Wed Jan  6 00:58:09 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: fix install rule for $(PROG)

Fri Oct  9 11:25:41 1992  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* gprof.1: updated SYNOPSIS to match actual behavior.

Mon Oct  5 17:50:16 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* gen-c-prog.awk:  New awk script, lightly changed from
	previously deleted make-c-prog.awk.  Converts a text file
	to a c function that prints that text.
	* flat_bl.m, fsf_callg_bl.m, bsd_callg_bl.m:  New files.
	Inputs to gen-c-prog.awk, containing text describing
	gprof output.
	* blurbs.c:  Removed.  Use *_bl.c instead.
	* Makefile.in: Use gen-cprog.awk to generate *_bl.c files
	from *_bl.m files.  Also, improve *clean rules.
	* printgprof.c (printgprof):  Usw new function names from *_bl.c.
	

Sun Aug 30 19:54:53 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* gprof.h, gprof.c, printfgprof.c:  Add support for two
	output styles:  The default is similar to the old FSF gprof,
	while -T sets the variable bsd_style_output, which causes
	output matching Berkeley's gprof.  The biggest differences
	are that with the FSF style output, the flat profile comes
	before the call graph; numbers come before explanations;
	and there is less gratuitous white space.
	* gprof.h, gprof.c, printfgprof.c:  New discard_underscores
	variable causes discarding of initial underscores when
	printing symbol names.  It is set unless there is a "main"
	symbol (without an underscore).
	* printfgprof.c:  New function printnameonly(), called
	by printname().  It handles stripping of initial '_',
	as well as C++ name-demangling.
	* gprof.callg, gprof.flat, make-c-prog.awk:  Removed.
	It is just as convenient to edit blurbs.c directly.
	* Makefile.in:  Removed rule for making blurbs.c.
	* blurbs.c:  This is now a true source file (as opposed
	to being generated from gprof.callg and gprof.flat).
	Change style to use one long string literal, instead of
	one literal per output line.  Add FSF-style blurb for call graph.

Wed Aug 19 14:36:39 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: always create installation directories.

Wed Aug 12 15:14:14 1992  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: change ${MACHINE} to $(MACHINE).

Sun Jul 19 17:34:01 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  removed installation of the now useless
	call.{flag,callg} files.  

	* gprof.1: now uses the standard man macros instead of the new BSD
	mandoc macros. 

Sun Jul 12 19:06:00 1992  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  Remove host section, expand target section.
	* config/mt-{tahoe,vax}:  Add, to match existing support files.
	* config/tmake-*:  Remove leftover crud.

	* blurbs.c:  New file, created from gprof.flat and gprof.callg by
	* make-c-prog.awk:  which processes text files into C programs.
	* printgprof.c (flatprofheader, gprofheader):  Call new functions
	to print blurbs.
	(printblurb):  Remove.
	* Makefile.in:  Infrastructure to build blurbs.
	* pathnames.h:  has been removed.  Gprof now has no filename
	dependencies in it.
	* gprof.c:  Lint.

Sat Jul 11 18:07:21 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: define man1dir and install the man page

Fri Jul 10 21:14:08 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn (zoo@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added dummy info and install-info targets

Thu Jun  4 11:34:02 1992  Mark Eichin  (eichin at cygnus.com)

	* lookup.c: fixed fencepost in nllookup and added dbg_nllookup for
	help in debugging the problem (with -DDEBUG)
	* gprof.c: symbol values are now real values, don't add the vma
	anymore. (done for solaris; should verify this on other platforms)
	* ChangeLog: created.
