This directory contains version 0.1 of the Software Productivity Unit
(SPU, pronounced ``spew''), which is a random program generator.

To configure, say `./configure'.

To build, say `make'.

To run, say `spu'.  This will produce a set of .h and .c files, plus a .mk
file which is a Makefile.  All the generated files share a prefix, which
defaults to "file", and can be set with the `--prefix' option.

To compile the generated program, you can say either

	make -f file.mk

or

	gcc file*.c

By default, SPU does not generate a large program.  To generate larger
programs, you can use the `--functions' option to set the number of
functions that will be generated.  For instance, `--functions 10000'
together with default values for the other options, will generate 600,000
lines or about 10MB of source code.

To find out about the other available options, use the `--help' option.

TO DO

Finish describing the command options.
