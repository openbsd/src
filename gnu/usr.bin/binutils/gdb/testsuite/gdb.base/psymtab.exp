# This test is looking for a bug that manifested itself when GDB was
# looking for a partial symbol such that there wasn't such a partial
# symbol in the psymtab, but such that the last psym in the psymtab
# had the right name but the wrong namespace.  Here, searching for
# zzz::dummy currently causes a search for 'zzz' in STRUCT_NAMESPACE
# without a preceding search for 'zzz' in VAR_NAMESPACE.
