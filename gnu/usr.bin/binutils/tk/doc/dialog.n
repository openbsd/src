.SH NAME
tk_dialog \- Create modal dialog and wait for response
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtk_dialog \fIwindow title text bitmap default string string ...\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure is part of the Tk script library.
Its arguments describe a dialog box:
.TP
\fIwindow\fR
Name of top-level window to use for dialog.  Any existing window
by this name is destroyed.
.TP
\fItitle\fR
Text to appear in the window manager's title bar for the dialog.
.TP
\fItext\fR
Message to appear in the top portion of the dialog box.
.TP
\fIbitmap\fR
If non-empty, specifies a bitmap to display in the top portion of
the dialog, to the left of the text.
If this is an empty string then no bitmap is displayed in the dialog.
.TP
\fIdefault\fR
If this is an integer greater than or equal to zero, then it gives
the index of the button that is to be the default button for the dialog
(0 for the leftmost button, and so on).
If less than zero or an empty string then there won't be any default
button.
.TP
\fIstring\fR
There will be one button for each of these arguments.
Each \fIstring\fR specifies text to display in a button,
in order from left to right.
.PP
After creating a dialog box, \fBtk_dialog\fR waits for the user to
select one of the buttons either by clicking on the button with the
mouse or by typing return to invoke the default button (if any).
Then it returns the index of the selected button:  0 for the leftmost
button, 1 for the button next to it, and so on.
.PP
While waiting for the user to respond, \fBtk_dialog\fR sets a local
grab.  This prevents the user from interacting with the application
in any way except to invoke the dialog box.
