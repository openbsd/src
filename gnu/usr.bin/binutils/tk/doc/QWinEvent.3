.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure places a window event on Tcl's
internal event queue for eventual servicing.  It creates a
Tcl_Event structure, copies the event into that structure,
and calls \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR to add the event to the queue.
When the event is eventually removed from the queue it is
processed just like all window events.
.PP
The \fIposition\fR argument to \fBTk_QueueWindowEvent\fR has
the same significance as for \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR;  see the
documentation for \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR for details.

.SH KEYWORDS
callback, clock, handler, modal timeout
