.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure posts a menu at a given position on the screen and
configures Tk so that the menu and its cascaded children can be
traversed with the mouse or the keyboard.
\fIMenu\fR is the name of a menu widget and \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR
are the root coordinates at which to display the menu.
If \fIentry\fR is omitted or an empty string, the
menu's upper left corner is positioned at the given point.
Otherwise \fIentry\fR gives the index of an entry in \fImenu\fR and
the menu will be positioned so that the entry is positioned over
the given point.
