This directory contains sources and documentation for RCS.

RCS, the Revision Control System, manages multiple revisions of files.
RCS can store, retrieve, log, identify, and merge revisions.
It is useful for files that are revised frequently,
e.g. programs, documentation, graphics, and papers.

See the following files and directories for more information.

	COPYING - copying conditions
	CREDITS - authorship information
	INSTALL - generic installation instructions
	INSTALL.RCS - installation instructions specific to RCS
	NEWS - recent changes, and possible future changes
	REFS - references to RCS and related free software and documentation
	man - sources for manual page entries
	rcs.ms - troff source for the paper `RCS--A System for Version Control'
	rcs_func.ms - brief overview
	src - sources for programs
	src/version.c - the version number of this release

If you lack troff, you can get GNU groff to format the documentation.
