.Sh NAME
.Nm tbl
.Nd format tables for troff
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tbl
.Op Fl Cv
.Op Ar files ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a preprocessor for
.Xr troff
which is used to format tables.
These tables are composed from columns that can be independently justified,
headings may be placed over single columns or groups of columns,
and horizontal or vertical lines may be added as desired.
.Pp
.Nm
preprocesses the input
.Ar files ,
(or standard input if no file is specified)
and prints its result to standard output.
.Pp
Each table is preceded by a
.Sq .TS
(table start) command, and followed by a
.Sq .TE
(table end) command.
.Nm
does not touch the reminder of the text.
The actual
.Sq .TS
and
.Sq .TE
lines are copied verbatim as well, so that further page layout macros
may use these to place the resulting tables.
.Pp
The format of
.Nm
input is as follows:
.Bd -literal
    text
    \&.TS
    table specification
    \&.TE
    further text
    \&.TS
    table specification
    \&.TE
    more text
    \&...
.Ed
.Pp
And a table specification is as follows:
.Bd -literal
    \&.TS
    table options ;
    table format .
    data
    ...
    \&.TE
.Ed
.Pp
Each table is formatted independently, and thus must contain a full
separate specification.
The
.Sq table options
affect the entire table.
Alternately, the
.Sq table format
can be changed in the middle of a table,
which yields the following template:
.Bd -literal
    \&.TS
    table options ;
    table format .
    table data
    \&...
    \&.T&
    table format .
    more data
    \&...
    \&.TE
.Ed
.Pp
.Ss TABLE OPTIONS
Options affecting the whole table may appear on a single line,
immediately following the
.Sq .TS
line.
The option names may be separated by spaces, tabulations, or commas,
and must end in a semicolon.
Available options are:
.Bl -tag -width linesize(n)
.It allbox
put a box around each item in the table.
.It box
put a box around the whole table.
.It center
center the table, instead of the default left-adjust.
.It delim(ab)
use 
.Ar a 
and 
.Ar b 
as
.Xr eqn 1
delimiters.
.It doublebox
put a double box around the whole table.
.It expand
make the table as wide as the current line length.
.It linesize(n)
set lines and rules in 
.Ar n 
point type.
.It tab(n)
use 
.Ar n 
spaces instead of a tabulation to separate items.
.El
.Ss TABLE FORMAT
Each line in the format section corresponds to a single line of the table,
except for the last line which corresponds to all remaining lines up to the 
next
.Sq .T& ,
if present.
Each column is represented by one letter from the following list, along
with modifiers.
Good style mandates separating specifications for each column with spaces
or tabs.
.Bl -tag -width l or L
.It l or L
left-adjusted column entry.
.It c or C
centered column entry.
.It r or R
right-adjusted colum entry.
.It n or N
numerical column entry, to be aligned with other numerical entries so that
unit digits match up.
.It a or A
alphabetic subcolumn.
Corresponding entries are left-aligned, and set so that the widest is centered
within the column.
.It s or S
spanned heading.
.It ^
vertically spanned heading.
.El
.Ss TABLE DATA
.Sh GNU DIFFERENCES
The version of
.Nm
shipping with
.Ox
is part of 
.Xr groff 1 , 
and features a few differences from classical
.Ux
.Nm .
.Pp
For instance, the output of GNU
.Nm
cannot be processed with
.Ux
.Xr troff 1 ,
but must be processed with GNU
.Xr troff 1 .
.Pp
Normally,
.Nm
makes use of diversions to attempt to prevent bad breaks in the table.
This can interact with some macro packages' use of diversions, for instance
with footnotes.
The
.Ar nokeep
option
can be used to tell
.Nm
not to try.
.Pp
The
.Ar decimalpoint (c)
option changes the character used as a decimal point instead of the default
period.
.Pp
The
.Ar f
format modifier can be used with a long font name enclosed in parenthesis.
.Pp
A
.Ar d
format modifier has been added, meaning that a vertically spanning entry
should be aligned at the bottom.
.Pp
There are no arrbitrary limits on the number of columns or the number of
text blocks in a table.
