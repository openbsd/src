.Sh NAME
.Nm smrsh
.Nd restricted shell for sendmail
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm smrsh
.Fl c Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm smrsh
program is intended as a replacement for
.Pa /bin/sh
for use in the
.Dq prog
mailer in
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration files.
It sharply limits the commands that can be run using the
.Dq |program
syntax of
.Xr sendmail 8
in order to improve the overall security of your system.
Briefly, even if a
.Dq bad guy
can get sendmail to run a program
without going through an alias or forward file,
.Nm smrsh
limits the set of programs that he or she can execute.
.Pp
Briefly,
.Nm smrsh
limits programs to be in a single directory, by default
.Pa /usr/libexec/sm.bin ,
allowing the system administrator to choose the set of acceptable commands,
and the shell built-in commands
.Dq exec ,
.Dq exit ,
and
.Dq echo .
It also rejects any commands with the characters
.Sq \e ,
.Sq < ,
.Sq > ,
.So
;
.Sc ,
.Sq $ ,
.So
(
.Sc ,
.So
)
.Sc ,
.Sq \er
(carriage return), or
.Sq \en
(newline) on the command line to prevent
.Dq end run
attacks.
It allows
.Dq ||
and
.Dq &&
to enable commands like:
.Bd -literal -compact -offset "XXXX"
.Qq "|exec /usr/local/bin/filter || exit 75"
.Ed
.Pp
Initial pathnames on programs are stripped,
so forwarding to
.Pa /usr/ucb/vacation ,
.Pa /usr/bin/vacation ,
.Pa /home/server/mydir/bin/vacation ,
and
.Pa vacation
all actually forward to
.Pa /usr/libexec/sm.bin/vacation .
.Pp
System administrators should be conservative about populating
the sm.bin directory.
For example, a reasonable additions is
.Xr vacation 1
and the like.
No matter how brow-beaten you may be,
never include any shell or shell-like program
(such as
.Xr perl 1 )
in the
sm.bin
directory.
Note that this does not restrict the use of shell or perl scripts
in the sm.bin directory (using the
.Dq #!
syntax);
it simply disallows execution of arbitrary programs.
Also, including mail filtering programs such as
.Xr procmail
is a very bad idea.
.Xr procmail
allows users to run arbitrary programs in their
.Xr procmailrc .
