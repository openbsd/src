       mmaaiill..llooccaall - store mail in a mailbox

       MMaaiill..llooccaall  reads  the standard input up to an end-of-file
       and appends it to each _u_s_e_r_'_s mmaaiill file.  The _u_s_e_r must be
       a valid user name.

       The options are as follows:

       --77        Do  not advertise 8BITMIME support in LMTP mode.

       --bb        Return a permanent error instead of a  temporary
                 error if a mailbox exceeds quota.

       --dd        Specify this is a delivery (for backward compat-
                 ibility).

       --ff _f_r_o_m   Specify the sender's name.

       --ll        Turn on LMTP mode.

       --rr _f_r_o_m   Specify the sender's name (for backward compati-
                 bility).

       Individual  mail  messages in the mailbox are delimited by
       an empty line followed by a line beginning with the string
       ``From  ''.   A  line containing the string ``From '', the
       sender's name and a time stamp is prepended to each deliv-
       ered  mail message.  A blank line is appended to each mes-
       sage.  A greater-than character (``>'')  is  prepended  to
       any  line  in  the  message  which could be mistaken for a
       ``From '' delimiter line (that is, a line  beginning  with
       the five characters ``From '' following a blank line).

       The  mail files are exclusively locked with flock(2) while
       mail is appended, and a uusseerr..lloocckk  file  also  is  created
       while  the  mailbox is locked for compatibility with older
       MUAs.

       If the ``biff'' service is returned  by  getservbyname(3),
       the biff server is notified of delivered mail.

       The  mmaaiill..llooccaall  utility  exits 0 on success, and >0 if an
       error occurs.

       A superset of mmaaiill..llooccaall (handling mailbox reading as well
       as  mail  delivery) appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX as the
