This directory contains tools.  Do not attempt to actually build
anything in this directory.

The Build script allows you to specify a base location for the object
files by using the -O flag:

	Build -O /tmp

will put the object files in /tmp/obj.*/.  Also, if the SENDMAIL_SUFFIX
environment variable is set, its value will be used in the obj.* directory
name.

The Build script allows you to specify a site configuration file by using
the -f flag:

	Build -f siteconfig.m4

You can put such site configuration files in the Site sub-directory;
see Site/README for details.

If you need to support multiple build configurations from the same tree,
you can use prefixes to differentiate your configurations.  Use the -Q
flag to Build:

	Build -Q prefix

Build will select a prefix.*.m4 file instead of the site.*.m4 file according
to the conventions in Site/README, and use it to modify the build
configuration.  The object directory used will be obj.prefix.*/.  Your
prefix.*.m4 files should reside in the Site directory.  You may not use
-Q and -f simultaneously.

While building a site configuration file, beyond using define() to set
variables, you can also add to a definition using the APPENDDEF() and
PREPENDDEF() macros.  For example:

	APPENDDEF(`confINCDIRS', `-I/usr/local/bind/include')

will add -I/usr/local/bind/include to the already existing confINCDIRS.
Note: There must be no trailing spaces after the last quote mark and
before the closing parenthesis.  Also you may need to properly quote
m4 reserved words as specified by your vendor's m4 command.

By default, sendmail will search your system for include and library
directories as well as certain libraries (libdb.* for Berkeley DB and
libbind.a or libresolv.* for name resolution).  You can turn off this
configuration step by specifying the -S flag with the Build command.

The OS subtree contains definitions for variations on a standard
model for system installation.  The M4 variables that can be defined
and their defaults before referencing the appropriate OS definitions
are listed below.  Note that variables preceded by an asterisk (*)

New build system
----------------

Sendmail's build system has undergone some rearrangement to accommodate
future development.  To the end user building sendmail from a distribution,
this should have little effect.  All the same configuration files and macros
should still behave the same. 

If you need to make some radical changes to a Makefile.m4 or are adding new
libraries or utilities, you may want to read the rest of this document on
how to work with the new system.


--------
Overview
--------

The purpose of the redesign is twofold.  First, it cuts down massively on
replicated information.  Second, the new design should lend itself better to
working on platforms with somewhat different build tools than on standard
unix.

The main idea is to have the Makefile.m4 in each subdirectory contain the
minimum amount of information needed to describe the elements needed for
the build process and the products produced.

Each product has a type and each type has a template that provides a basic
makefile for that type.  Right now the templates are organized by the broad
type of the operating system. The two existing types are UNIX and NT.


------------------
Makefile.m4 basics
------------------

Each Makefile.m4 is split into separate products.  For the most part, the
products are considered totally separate from other products in the
Makefile.m4.  Each products is delineated by two macros: bldPRODUCT_START and
bldPRODUCT_END.

The form for bldPRODUCT_START is:
bldPRODUCT_START(<product_type>, <product_name>)
where <product_type> is the type of product to be produced (e.g., executable,
library, manpage) and <product_name> is a unique identifier within the
product_type name space for this Makefile.m4

The form for bldPRODUCT_END is:
bldPRODUCT_END

This is marks the end of all the information for the current product.

There is one other macro required in any Makefile.m4 and that is bldFINISH
which takes no arguments and must appear after all the products have been
defined.

When the actual makefile is generated each product appears in two sections.
The first is where makefile variables are set (e.g., CFLAGS=-O).  The second
is where the targets appear (e.g., foo.o: foo.c).  Anything diverted to
bldTARGETS_SECTION ends up in the second part of the makefile.  Anything
else turns up in the header part where variables are defined.

As always, any straight text put into Makefile.m4 will just show up as is
in the finished makefile.


-------------
Product Types
-------------

executable
----------

This means an executable created from C sources.  The name of the executable
is derived from the product_name in the bldPRODUCT_START macro. 

bldSOURCES - This should be defined to a space separated list of source
files that make up the executable.

bldBIN_TYPE - This determines where the binaries will be installed and what
permissions they will have.  Available types are `U', `K', `S', and `E'.  See
M4/make/executable.m4 for what the different types mean.

bldTARGET_LINKS - This determines where additional symbolic links to the
executable are placed.  These should be full pathnames, separated by
spaces.


manpage
-------

This builds manpages from source using *roff. 

bldSOURCES - This should be defined to a space separated list of man source
files.


library
-------

This builds a static library from C sources.

bldSOURCES - This should be defined to a space separated list of C source
files that make up the library.
