DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       VVaaccaattiioonn returns a message to  the  sender  of  a  message
       telling them that you are currently not reading your mail.
       The intended use is in a _._f_o_r_w_a_r_d file.  For example, your
       _._f_o_r_w_a_r_d file might have:

              \eric, "|/usr/bin/vacation -a allman eric"

       which would send messages to you (assuming your login name
       was eric) and reply to any messages for ``eric'' or ``all-
       man''.

       Available options:

       --aa _a_l_i_a_s
              Handle  messages  for  in  the same manner as those
              received for the user's login name.

       --ff _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Use _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e as name of  the  database  instead  of
              _~_/_._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n_._d_b.   Unless the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e starts with /
              it is relative to ~.

       --ii     Initialize the vacation database files.  It  should
              be used before you modify your _._f_o_r_w_a_r_d file.

       --mm _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Use  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  as  name  of the file containing the
              message to send instead of _~_/_._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n_._m_s_g.  Unless
              the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e starts with / it is relative to ~.

       --rr _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l
              Set  the  reply  interval  to  _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l  days.  The
              default is one  week.   An  interval  of  ``0''  or
              ``infinite''  (actually, any non-numeric character)
              will never send more than one reply.

       --ss _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
              Use _a_d_d_r_e_s_s instead of the sender  address  in  the
              _F_r_o_m line to determine the reply address.

       --xx     reads an exclusion list from stdin (one address per
              line).  Mails coming from an address in this exclu-
              sion  list  won't  get  a reply by vvaaccaattiioonn.  It is
              possible to exclude complete domains by  specifying
              ``@domain'' as element of the exclusion list.

       --zz     Set  the  sender  of the vacation message to ``<>''
              instead of the user.  This  probably  violates  the
              RFCs  since vacation messages are not required by a
              standards-track RFC to have a null reverse-path.

       No message will be sent unless _l_o_g_i_n (or an _a_l_i_a_s supplied
       using  the  --aa  option)  is  part of either the ``To:'' or
       ``Cc:''  headers  of   the   mail.    No   messages   from
       ``???-REQUEST'',  ``Postmaster'', ``UUCP'', ``MAILER'', or
       ``MAILER-DAEMON'' will be replied to (where these  strings
       are  case  insensitive)  nor  is  a notification sent if a
       ``Precedence:  bulk''  or  ``Precedence:  junk''  line  is
       included  in  the  mail headers.  The people who have sent
       you messages are maintained as a  db(3)  database  in  the
       file _._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n_._d_b in your home directory.

       VVaaccaattiioonn expects a file _._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n_._m_s_g, in your home direc-
       tory, containing a message to be sent back to each sender.
       It  should  be an entire message (including headers).  For
       example, it might contain:

              From: eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU (Eric Allman)
              Subject: I am on vacation
              Delivered-By-The-Graces-Of: The Vacation program
              Precedence: bulk

              I am on vacation until July 22.  If you have something urgent,
              please contact Keith Bostic <bostic@CS.Berkeley.EDU>.
              --eric

       VVaaccaattiioonn reads the first line from the standard input  for
       a UNIX ``From'' line to determine the sender.  Sendmail(8)
       includes this ``From'' line automatically.

       Fatal errors, such  as  calling  vvaaccaattiioonn  with  incorrect
       arguments,  or with non-existent _l_o_g_i_ns, are logged in the
       system log file, using syslog(8).
