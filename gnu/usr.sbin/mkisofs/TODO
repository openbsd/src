	1) Allow multiple input paths to be concatenated together.
	This is a little tricky, because the directory entries need to be
	correctly sorted as per iso9660 specifications.  It would be better to
	force the user to add hard links or copies of the files rather than do
	the wrong thing.  Leave alone for the time being, I am not sure that
	this feature is really needed.

	2) For symlinks, we may need to strip out the leading path
	information if the link is to an absolute file, and the absolute
	address is in the space that we are dumping to the CDROM.  Who the
	hell knows what we should  really  do with this, actually.  Leave it
	for now and see if anyone  squalks.

	3) Find out if output needs to be written at a particular
	blocksize or not.
