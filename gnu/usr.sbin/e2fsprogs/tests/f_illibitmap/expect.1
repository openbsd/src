Note: if there is several inode or block bitmap blocks
which require relocation, or one part of the inode table
which must be moved, you may wish to try running e2fsck
with the '-b 8193' option first.  The problem may lie only
with the primary block group descriptor, and the backup
block group descriptor may be OK.

Inode bitmap for group 0 is not in group.  (block 4000)
Relocate? yes

Filesystem did not have a UUID; generating one.

Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Relocating group 0's inode bitmap to 4...
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
Fix summary information? yes

Inode bitmap differences: +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11.  FIXED

test_filesys: ***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED *****
test_filesys: 11/32 files (0.0% non-contiguous), 22/100 blocks
Exit status is 1
