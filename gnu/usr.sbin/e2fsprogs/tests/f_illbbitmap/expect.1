Note: if there is several inode or block bitmap blocks
which require relocation, or one part of the inode table
which must be moved, you may wish to try running e2fsck
with the '-b 8193' option first.  The problem may lie only
with the primary block group descriptor, and the backup
block group descriptor may be OK.

Block bitmap for group 0 is not in group.  (block 4096)
Relocate? yes

Filesystem did not have a UUID; generating one.

Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Relocating group 0's block bitmap to 4...
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
Fix summary information? yes

Block bitmap differences: +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11 +12 +13 +14 +15 +16 +17 +18 +19 +20 +21.  FIXED
Inode bitmap differences: -12 -13 -14 -15 -16 -17 -18 -19 -20 -21.  FIXED
Padding at end of block bitmap is not set. Fix? yes
