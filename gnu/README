$OpenBSD: README,v 1.1 2001/08/18 13:12:57 espie Exp $

Some of the software in this subtree follows special rules.

Specifically, the FSF not only wants the GPL licence, but they
also insist that you assign your copyright to the FSF for anything
but trivial changes.

So:
- check the history of external code before importing it.
- be ready to arrange for copyright papers somewhat in advance if
you want to work on it (the FSF takes a few months to process these).

Otherwise, changes might not make it to the main distribution, and may
need some further maintenance over time, or risk getting lost.

Some internal changes are acceptable, but OpenBSD can't afford to maintain
a complete separate toolchain on its own.
