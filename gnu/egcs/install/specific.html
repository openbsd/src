<p>GNU/Linux Alpha EV56 or PCA56 hosts running Red Hat 4.2 or 5.0 may
see errors of this sort:</p>
<pre>
  Error: Unknown pseudo-op:  `.arch'
</pre>
<p>This is a signal that a new assembler is needed if you want to generate BWX insns for your machine.</p>

<p>The version of GCC shipped with Red Hat 4.2 (2.7.0.2) has a fault wherein
it will silently generate incorrect code.  The version shipped with
Red Hat 5.0 (2.8.0.1) is not broken, but required an extra -m21164a
argument on the command-line.  In order to visibly trap 2.7.0.2,
I now issue DEC's .arch pseudo into the assembly.  Relieving the
problem of mucking with command-line arguments for 2.8.0.1 is a
pleasant side effect.</p>

<p>If you've got Red Hat 5.0 installed, you may grab binutils 2.9.1
and be happy.  If you've got Red Hat 4.2, bugs make it much harder
to upgrade pieces on your own, and you are better off upgrading
the entire system.</p>

<p>In either case, your problem may be bypassed by not emitting BWX
code by default.  Do this by using</p>
<pre>
  configure alphaev5-unknown-linux-gnulibc1
</pre>
<p>if you have RH 4.2, or</p>
<pre>
  configure alphaev5-unknown-linux-gnu
</pre>
<p>if you have RH 5.0.</p>

<p>The following error:</p>
<pre>
  Error: macro requires $at register while noat in effect
</pre>
<p>also indicates that you should upgrade to a newer version of
the assembler, 2.9 or later.  If you can not upgrade the assembler, the
compiler option "-Wa,-m21164a" may work around this problem.</p>

<h3><a name="alpha*-dec-osf*">alpha*-dec-osf*</a></h3>

<p>If you install a shared libstdc++ and, when you link a non-trivial C++
program (for example, <code>gcc/testsuite/g++.other/delete3.C</code>),
the linker reports a couple of errors about multiply-defined symbols
(for example, <code>nothrow</code>, <code>__throw</code> and
<code>terminate(void)</code>), you've probably got a linker bug, for
which there's no known fix.  The officially recommended work-around is
to remove the shared libstdc++.</p>

<p>An alternative solution is to arrange that all symbols from
<code>libgcc</code> get copied to the shared <code>libstdc++</code>;
see detailed solution below.  (Surprising as it may seem, this does
indeed fix the problem!)  <b>Beware</b> that this may bring you
binary-compatibility problems in the future, if you don't use the same
work-around next time you build <code>libstdc++</code>: if programs
start to depend on <code>libstdc++</code> to provide symbols that used
to be only in <code>libgcc</code>, you must arrange that
<code>libstdc++</code> keeps providing them, otherwise the programs
will have to be relinked.</p>

<p>The magic spell is to add <code>-Wl,-all,-lgcc,-none</code> to the
definition of macro <code>SHDEPS</code> in
<code>libstdc++/config/dec-osf.ml</code> <b>before</b>
<code>alpha*-dec-osf*/libstdc++/Makefile</code> is created (a <a
href="dec-osf-shlibstdc++.patch">patch</a> that does just that is
available).  If the Makefile already exists, run
<code>./config.status</code> within directory
<code>alpha*-dec-osf*/libstdc++</code> (and
<code>alpha*-dec-osf*/ieee/libstdc++</code>, if it also exists).
Remove any existing <code>libstdc++.so*</code> from such directories,
and run <code>make all-target-libstdc++</code> in the top-level
directory, then <code>make install-target-libstdc++</code>.</p>
	  
<p>If you have already removed the build tree, you may just remove
<code>libstdc++.so.2.10.0</code> from the install tree and re-create
it with the command <code>gcc -shared -o libstdc++.so.2.10.0
-Wl,-all,-lstdc++,-lgcc,-none -lm</code>.  If the <code>ieee</code>
sub-directory exists, repeat this command in it, with the additional
flag <code>-mieee</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="dos">GCC with DOS</h3>

<p>A binary distribution is available at <a

mirrors.</p>


<hr>
<h3><a name="hppa*-hp-hpux*">hppa*-hp-hpux*</a></h3>

<p>We <b>highly</b> recommend using gas/binutils-2.8 or newer on all hppa
platforms; you may encounter a variety of problems when using the HP assembler.</p>

<p>If you wish to use pa-risc 2.0 architecture support, you must use either the
HP assembler or a recent
<a href="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/binutils/snapshots">snapshot of gas</a>.</p>

<p>More specific information to hppa*-hp-hpux* targets follows.</p>


<hr>
<h3><a name="hppa*-hp-hpux9">hppa*-hp-hpux9</a></h3>

<p>The HP assembler has major problems on this platform.  We've tried to work
around the worst of the problems.  However, those workarounds may be causing
linker crashes in some circumstances; the workarounds also probably prevent
shared libraries from working.  Use the GNU assembler to avoid these problems.</p>

<p>The configuration scripts for GCC will also trigger a bug in the hpux9
shell.  To avoid this problem set CONFIG_SHELL to /bin/ksh and SHELL to
/bin/ksh in your environment.</p>


<hr>
<h3><a name="hppa*-hp-hpux10">hppa*-hp-hpux10</a></h3>

<p>For hpux10.20, we <b>highly</b> recommend you pick up the latest sed
patch <code>PHCO_15468</code> from HP.  HP has two sites which provide patches free of charge:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://us-support.external.hp.com">US, Canada, Asia-Pacific, and
Latin-America</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://europe-support.external.hp.com">Europe</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The HP assembler on these systems is much better than the hpux9 assembler,
but still has some problems.  Most notably the assembler inserts timestamps
into each object file it creates, causing the 3-stage comparison test to fail
during a `<code>make bootstrap</code>'.  You should be able to continue by 
saying `<code>make all</code>' after getting the failure from `<code>make 
bootstrap</code>'.</p>


<hr>
<h3><a name="ix86-*-linux*">i?86-*-linux*</a></h3>
<p>You will need binutils-2.9.1.0.15 or newer for exception handling to work.</p>

<p>If you receive Signal 11 errors when building on GNU/Linux, then it is
possible you have a hardware problem.  Further information on this can be
found on <a href="http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/">www.bitwizard.nl.</a></p>


<hr>
<h3><a name="ix86-*-sco3.2v5*">i?86-*-sco3.2v5*</a></h3>

<p>If you are building languages other than C, you must follow the instructions
about invoking `<code>make bootstrap</code>' because the native OpenServer
compiler will build a <code>cc1plus</code> that will not correctly parse many
valid C++ programs including those in <code>libgcc.a</code>.  <b>You must do a `<code>make bootstrap</code>' if you are building with the native compiler.</b></p>

<p>Use of the `<code>-march-pentiumpro</code>' flag can result in
unrecognized opcodes when using the native assembler.  While
it's rather rare to see these emitted by GCC yet, errors of the basic form:</p>
<pre>
  /usr/tmp/ccaNlqBc.s:22:unknown instruction: fcomip
  /usr/tmp/ccaNlqBc.s:50:unknown instruction: fucomip
</pre>
<p>are symptoms of this problem.   You may work around this by not
building affected files with that flag or by using the GNU assembler.   
Users of GNU assembler should see the note below for hazards on doing so.</p>

<p>If you choose to configure with <code>--enable-shared</code> you should also
specificy <code>--with-gnu-as --disable-multilib</code> even if you are not
using the GNU assembler.   In doing so you will give up the ability
to generate COFF executables as described below.   This combination 
of flags is necessary to suppress negative interactions with multilibing.</p>

<p>The native SCO assembler that is provided with the OS at no charge
is normally required.  If, however, you must be able to use the GNU
assembler you may configure this package using the flags <code>--with-gnu-as</code>.  
You must use a recent version of GNU binutils; version 2.9.1 seems to work well.
If you select this option, you will be unable to reliably build COFF
images.  In general, the <code>--with-gnu-as</code> option isn't as well tested as the native assembler.</p>

<p>Unlike various prereleases of GCC that used <code>-belf</code> and 
defaulted to COFF, you must now use the <code>-melf</code> and 
<code>-mcoff</code> flags to toggle between the two object file formats.     
ELF is now the default.</p>

<p>Look in <code>gcc/config/i386/sco5.h</code> (search for "messy") for additional OpenServer-specific flags.</p>

<p>Systems based on OpenServer before 5.0.4 (`<code>uname -X</code>' will
tell you what you're running) require TLS597 from ftp.sco.com/TLS for
C++ constructors and destructors to work right.</p>

<p>The system linker in (at least) 5.0.4 and 5.0.5 will sometimes
do the wrong thing for a construct that GCC will emit for PIC
code.  This can be seen as execution testsuite failures when using
-fPIC on 921215-1.c, 931002-1.c, nestfunc-1.c, and gcov-1.c.
For 5.0.5, an updated linker that will cure this problem is
available.  You must install both <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/Supplements/rs505a/">
ftp://ftp.sco.com/Supplements/rs505a/</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/SLS/">
OSS499A</a>.</p>

<p>The dynamic linker in OpenServer 5.0.5 (earlier versions may show
the same problem) aborts on certain g77-compiled programs.  It's particluarly
likely to be triggered by building Fortran code with the <code>-fPIC</code>
flag.
Although it's conceivable that the error could be triggered by other
code, only G77-compiled code has been observed to cause this abort.
If you are getting core dumps immediately upon execution of your
g77 program - and especially if it's compiled with -fPIC - try applying
<a href="sco_osr5_g77.patch"><code>`sco_osr5_g77.patch'</code></a> to your libf2c and 
rebuilding
GCC.  Affected faults, when analyzed in a debugger, will show a stack
backtrace with a fault occurring in <code>rtld()</code> and the program
running as <code>/usr/lib/ld.so.1</code>.  This problem has been reported to SCO engineering
and will hopefully be addressed in later releases.</p>


<hr>
<h3><a name="ix86-*-udk">i?86-*-udk</a></h3>

<p>This target emulates the SCO Universal Development Kit and requires that
package be installed.  (If it is installed, you will have a <code>/udk/usr/ccs/bin/cc </code>file present.)  It's very much like the <code>i?86-*-unixware7*</code> target
but is meant to be used when hosting on a system where UDK isn't the
default compiler such as OpenServer 5 or Unixware 2.  This target will
generate binaries that will run on OpenServer, Unixware 2, or Unixware 7, 
with the same warnings and caveats as the SCO UDK.</p>

<p>You can stage1 with either your native compiler or with UDK.   If you
don't do a full bootstrap when initially building with your native compiler
you will have an utterly unusable pile of bits as your reward.</p>

<p>This target is a little tricky to build because we have to distinguish
it from the native tools (so it gets headers, startups, and libraries
from the right place) while making the tools not think we're actually 
building a cross compiler.   The easiest way to do this is with a configure
command like this:</p>
<pre>
  CC=/udk/usr/ccs/bin/cc <i>/your/path/to/</i>gcc/configure --host=i686-pc-udk --target=i686-pc-udk --exec-prefix=udk-
</pre>
<p><i>You should substitute 'i686' in the above command with the appropriate
processor for your host.</i></p>

<p>You should follow this with a `<code>make bootstrap</code>'  then
`<code>make install</code>'.  You can then access the UDK-targeted GCC 
tools by adding <code>udk-</code> before the commonly known name.  For example, to invoke the C compiler, you would use `<code>udk-gcc</code>'.  They will coexist peacefully with any native-target GCC tools you may have installed.</p>

<!-- rs6000-ibm-aix*, powerpc-ibm-aix* -->

<p>AIX Make frequently has problems with GCC makefiles.  GNU Make 3.76 or
newer is recommended to build on this platform.</p>

<p>Errors involving &quot;alloca&quot; when building GCC generally are due
to an incorrect definition of <tt>CC</tt> in the Makefile or mixing files
compiled with the native C compiler and GCC.  During the stage1 phase of
the build, the native AIX compiler <b>must</b> be invoked as &quot;cc&quot;
(not &quot;xlc&quot;).  Once <tt>configure</tt> has been informed of
&quot;xlc&quot;, one needs to use &quot;make distclean&quot; to remove the
configure cache files and ensure that <tt>$CC</tt> environment variable
does not provide a definition that will confuse <tt>configure</tt>.
If this error occurs during stage2 or later, then the problem most likely
is the version of Make (see above).</p>

<p>Some versions of the AIX binder (linker) can fail with a relocation
overflow severe error when the -bbigtoc option is used to link
GCC-produced object files into an executable that overflows the TOC.  A fix
for APAR IX75823 (OVERFLOW DURING LINK WHEN USING GCC AND -BBIGTOC) is
available from IBM Customer Support and from its
<a href="http://service.boulder.ibm.com/">service.boulder.ibm.com</a>
website as PTF U455193.</p>

<p>Binutils does not support AIX 4.3 (at least through release 2.9).
GNU as and GNU ld will not work properly and one should not configure GCC
to use those GNU utilities.  Use the native AIX tools which do interoperate
with GCC.</p>

<p>AIX 4.3 utilizes a new &quot;large format&quot; archive to support both
32-bit and 64-bit object modules.  The routines provided in AIX 4.3.0 and
AIX 4.3.1 to parse archive libraries did not handle the new format correctly.
These routines are used by GCC and result in error messages during linking
such as &quot;not a COFF file&quot;.  The version of the routines shipped
with AIX 4.3.1 should work for a 32-bit environment.  The <tt>-g</tt> option
of the archive command may be used to create archives of 32-bit objects
using the original "small format".  A correct version of the routines is
shipped with AIX 4.3.2.</p>

<p>The initial assembler shipped with AIX 4.3.0 generates incorrect object
files.  A fix for APAR IX74254 (64BIT DISASSEMBLED OUPUT FROM COMPILER FAILS
TO ASSEMBLE/BIND) is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
<a href="http://service.boulder.ibm.com/">service.boulder.ibm.com</a>
website as PTF U453956.  This fix is incorporated in AIX 4.3.1 and above.</p>

<p>The AIX 4.3.2.1 linker (bos.rte.bind_cmds Level 4.3.2.1) will dump core
with a segmentation fault when invoked by any version of GCC.  A fix for
APAR IX87327 will be available from IBM Customer Support.</p>

<h3><a name="m68k-*-nextstep*">m68k-*-nextstep*</a></h3>

<p>You absolutely <b>must</b> use GNU sed and GNU make on this platform.</p>

<p>On NEXTSTEP 3.x where x &lt; 3 the build of GCC will abort during  
stage1 with an error message like this:</p>
<pre>
  _eh
  /usr/tmp/ccbbsZ0U.s:987:Unknown pseudo-op: .section
  /usr/tmp/ccbbsZ0U.s:987:Rest of line ignored. 1st junk character  
  valued 95 (_).
</pre>
<p>The reason for this is the fact that NeXT's assembler for these  
versions of the operating system does not support the .section  
pseudo op that's needed for full C++ exception functionality.</p>

<p>As NeXT's assembler is a derived work from GNU as, a free  
replacement that does can be obtained at 
<a href="ftp://ftp.next.peak.org:/next-ftp/next/apps/devtools/as.3.3.NIHS.s.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.next.peak.org:/next-ftp/next/apps/devtools/as.3.3.NIHS.s.tar.gz</a>.
</p>

<p>If you try to build the integrated C++ & C++ runtime libraries on this system
you will run into trouble with include files.  The way to get around this is
to use the following sequence.  Note you must have write permission to
the directory <i>prefix</i> you secified in the configuration preocess of GCC for this sequence to work.</p>
<pre>
  cd bld-gcc
  make all-texinfo all-bison all-byacc all-binutils all-gas all-ld
  cd gcc
  make bootstrap
  make install-headers-tar
  cd ..
  make bootstrap3

<hr>
<h3><a name="mips*-sgi-irix[45]">mips*-sgi-irix[45]</a></h3>

<p>You must use GAS on these platforms, as the native assembler can not handle the code for exception handling support. Either of these messages indicates that you are using the MIPS assembler when instead you should be using GAS:</p>
<pre>
  as0: Error: ./libgcc2.c, line 1:Badly delimited numeric literal

<pre>
  as0: Error: /src/bld-gcc/gcc/libgcc2.c, line 1:undefined symbol in expression
  .word $LECIE1-$LSCIE1
</pre>

<p>These systems don't have ranlib, which various components in GCC need; you
should be able to avoid this problem by installing GNU binutils, which includes
a functional ranlib for this system.</p>

<p>You may get the following warning on irix4 platforms, it can be safely
ignored.</p>
<pre>
  warning: foo.o does not have gp tables for all its sections.
</pre>

<p>When building GCC, the build process loops rebuilding cc1 over and
over again.  This happens on mips-sgi-irix5.2, and possibly other platforms.<br>
It has been reported that this is a known bug in the make shipped with
IRIX 5.2.  We recommend you use GNU make instead of the vendor supplied
make program; however, you may have success with "smake" on IRIX 5.2 if
you do not have GNU make available.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="mips*-sgi-irix6">mips*-sgi-irix6</a></h3>

<p>You must <i>not</i> use GAS on irix6 platforms; doing so will only cause problems.</p>

<p>These systems don't have ranlib, which various components in GCC need; you
should be able to avoid this problem by making a dummy script called ranlib
which just exits with zero status and placing it in your path.</p>

<p>GCC does not currently support generating O32 ABI binaries in the
mips-sgi-irix6 configurations.  It used to be possible to create a GCC with O32 ABI only support by configuring it for the mips-sgi-irix5 target.  See the link below for details.</p>

<p>GCC does not correctly pass/return structures which are
smaller than 16 bytes and which are not 8 bytes. The problem is very
involved and difficult to fix. It affects a number of other targets also,
but IRIX 6 is affected the most, because it is a 64 bit target, and 4 byte
structures are common. The exact problem is that structures are being padded
at the wrong end, e.g. a 4 byte structure is loaded into the lower 4 bytes
of the register when it should be loaded into the upper 4 bytes of the
register. </p>

<p>GCC is consistent with itself, but not consistent with the SGI C compiler
[and the SGI supplied runtime libraries], so the only failures that can
happen are when there are library functions that take/return such
structures. There are very few such library functions. I can only recall
seeing two of them: inet_ntoa, and semctl. </p>

<p>You will need 
<a href="ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/binutils">binutils-2.9.4.0.8</a> or newer for a working GCC. It is strongly recommended to recompile binutils

<h3><a name="*-*-solaris*">*-*-solaris*</a></h3>

<p>Starting with Solaris, Sun does not ship a C compiler any more. To
bootstrap and install GCC you first have to install a pre-built
compiler, for example from <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/">
http://www.sunfreeware.com</a>.</p>

<p>Sun as 4.X is broken in that it cannot cope with long symbol names.
A typical error message might look similiar to the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
/usr/ccs/bin/as: "/var/tmp/ccMsw135.s", line 11041: error: can't compute      
value of an expression involving an external symbol.

See the <a href="../faq.html#squangle">How to work around too long C++
symbol names?</a> FAQ entry for further information.</p>

<p>Sun make in all known Solaris 1 (SunOS 4) and Solaris 2 releases has a
broken <i>VPATH</i> mechanism, which means you must either:
<ul>
  <li>Use GNU make (recommended), <em>or:</em></li>
  <li>Always build in the source directory, <em>or:</em></li>
  <li><em>(For GCC 2.95.1 only)</em>

<h3><a name="sparc-sun-solaris*">sparc-sun-solaris*</a></h3>

<p>binutils 2.9.1 has known bugs on this platform. We recommend to use the

<h3><a name="sparc-sun-solaris2.7">sparc-sun-solaris2.7</a></h3>

<p>Sun patch 107058-01 (1999-01-13) for SPARC Solaris 7 triggers a bug in
the dynamic linker.  This problem (Sun bug 4210064) affects GCC 2.8
and later, including all EGCS releases.  Sun formerly recommended
107058-01 for all Solaris 7 users, but around 1999-09-01 it started to
recommend it only for people who use Sun's compilers.</p>
  
<p>Here are some workarounds to this problem:
<ul>
  <li>Do not install Sun patch 107058-01 until after Sun releases a
  complete patch for bug 4210064.  This is the simplest course to take,
  unless you must also use Sun's C compiler.  Unfortunately 107058-01
  is preinstalled on some new Solaris-based hosts, so you may have to
  back it out.</li>
  
<li>Copy the original, unpatched Solaris 7
  <code>/usr/ccs/bin/as</code> into
  <code>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/2.95.1/as</code>,
  adjusting the latter name to fit your local conventions and software
  version numbers.</li>

<li>Install Sun patch 106950-03 (1999-05-25) or later.  Nobody with
  both 107058-01 and 106950-03 installed has reported the bug with GCC
  and Sun's dynamic linker.  This last course of action is riskiest,
  for two reasons.  First, you must install 106950 on all hosts that
  run code generated by GCC; it doesn't suffice to install it only on
  the hosts that run GCC itself.  Second, Sun says that 106950-03 is
  only a partial fix for bug 4210064, but Sun doesn't know whether the
  partial fix is adequate for GCC.  Revision -08 or later should fix
  the bug, but (as of 1999-10-06) it is still being tested.</li>

<h3><a name="sunv5">Sun V5.0 Compiler Bugs</a></h3>
The Sun V5.0 compilers are known to mis-compile GCC, which in turn causes
GCC to fail its bootstrap comparison test.  We expect to have a workaround
ready in time for GCC 2.95.2.

<h3><a name="sparc-sun-sunos*">sparc-sun-sunos*</a></h3>

<p>A bug in the SunOS4 linker will cause it to crash when linking
-fPIC compiled objects (and will therefore not allow you to build
shared libraries).</p>

<p>To fix this problem you can either use the most recent version of
binutils or get the latest SunOS4 linker patch (patch ID 100170-10)
from Sun's patch site.</p>

<h3><a name="sparc-unknown-linux-gnulibc1">sparc-unknown-linux-gnulibc1</a></h3>

<p>It has been reported that you might need 
<a href="ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/hjl">binutils-2.8.1.0.23</a>
for this platform, too.</p>

<h3><a name="sparc64-*-*">sparc64-*-*</a></h3>

<p>GCC version 2.95 is not able to compile code correctly for <code>sparc64</code> targets.  Users of the Linux kernel, at least, can use the <code>sparc32</code> program to start up a new shell invocation with an environment that causes <code>configure</code> to recognize (via <code>uname -a</code>) the system as <code>sparc-*-*</code> instead.</p>

<h3><a name="win+os2"></a>GCC with Windows or OS/2</h3>

<p>GCC does not currently support Windows, either natively or with the
cygwin32 dll.  However Mumit Khan has been working on supporting Windows
with GCC.  You should check out his site if you're interested in Windows
support.
<a href="http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/">GNU Win32 related projects</a></p>

<p>GCC does not currently support OS/2.  However, Andrew Zabolotny has been
working on a generic os/2 port with pgcc.  The current code code can be found
at <a href="http://www.goof.com/pcg/os2/">http://www.goof.com/pcg/os2/</a>.</p>


<hr>
<h3><a name="elf_targets">all ELF targets (SVR4, Solaris, etc.)</a></h3>

<p>C++ support is significantly better on ELF targets if you use the GNU
linker; duplicate copies of inlines, vtables and template instantiations
will be discarded automatically.</p>
